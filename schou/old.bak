C. THE LEGAL CHARACTERS USED IN NETVAL VERSION 2.05 AND 3
   -------------------------------------------------------

   The Netval 2.05 and 3 USERNAME can accept alphanumeric and ' ', '#', '$',
'*', ',', '.', '-'(dash), '/', '&', if you username is not in the above 
character set then it has to be changed before the upgrade from version 1
to 2 or version 1 to 3.

   The Netval 2.05 host and node listname can only accept alphanumeric and 
'_'(underline). If your listname contains the character that is not in this 
character set please change it before the upgrade.

D. THE QUESTION AND ANSWER RELATED TO CLASS AND GROUP.
   ---------------------------------------------------

1. What is the maximum number of classes which can be defined via the 
   Supervisor FENCE macro ?  What is the maximum number of groups which
   can be defined via the supervisor FENCE macro ?

2. What is the maximum number of node lists which can be defined via 
   NETVAL ? What is the maximum number of host lists which can be defined 
   via NETVAL ?

3. What is the maximum number of entries which can be placed in a single 
   class ? What is the maximum number of entries which can be placed in
   a single group ?

4. What is the maximum number of entries which can be placed in a single 
   node list ? What is the maximum number of entries which can be placed
   in a single host list ?

5. If a class/group definition or node/host list has 'N' entries included,
   how many bytes (sectors) of disk storage will this list require ? If
   the list is an exception list, does the number of bytes (sectors) change, 
   especially increase ?

ANSWERS:

 The maximum class/group table size can be set depending on the table 
size declared in the SUP macro FENCE.

EXAMPLE: 
   FENCE(30,6,10,6) : maximum class = 30
                      maximum class table size = 6 sector
                                               = 256 * 6 = 1536 bytes
                      maximum group = 10
                      maximum group table size = 6 sector
                                               = 256 * 6 = 1536 bytes

   The format of the class/group table is as follows :

   WORD
   0 - 29 Class 1-30
          BIT 
          0-15 pointer to first node/host
          16 if on, list is exception list
          17-31 size of list in bytes(zero if undefined)
   30 - 373 
          halfwords of host or node, if bit 0 or 16 is on, entry is 
          host number.

   Some format can be applied to group, except group use halfwords of
   host. 

   Use the following formula for the calculation:
   
   1. MAXIMUM_TABLE_CLASS_LIST_SIZE = 
      maximum_class_table_size - (maximum_class * 4)
            (   6 * 256   )    - (30 * 4 ) = 1416 bytes

   2. MAXIMUM_TABLE_CLASS_LIST_HALFWORD_SIZE = 
      maximum_table_class_list_size div 2
                    1416 / 2 = 708 (maximum # of hosts and nodes in this 
                                    class table)

      same formula can be used for GROUP
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   ex. the class/group table defined in Netval 2.05 

   PAGES_IN_NODE_LIST_HEADER = 5
   PAGES_IN_NODE_LIST = 66
   PAGES_IN_HOST_LIST_HEADER = 1
   PAGES_IN_HOST_LIST = 65

   1 PAGE = 256 bytes                                        

             *************************************************
The following is the ansdwer for your questions.
Answer for question #1:
  The maximum macro of FENCE = FENCE(1023, 128, 1023, 128)

  TOTAL CLASS NETVAL CAN HANDLE = [(5 page*256) - (4 word*4 bytes)]/8
                                = 158 classes
  5 pages used for node list header, 4 fullwords are used for node
  description, 8 bytes for EACH class, describing the list(node or
  host) that make up the class.

  TOTAL GROUP NETVAL CAN HANDLE =[(1 page*256) - (4 word*4 bytes)]/8
                                = 30 groups
  In 1 page of host list header, 4 fullwords are used for host
  description. 8 bytes for each group, describing the list(host) that
  make up the group.

Answers for question #2, and 4:
  Maximum number of node list       = 66 (each list uses 1 page)
  Maximum number of nodes in a list = (256 - 28)/2 = 114 nodes.
                                      (28 bytes for ascii description)
  Maximum number of host list       = 65 (each list uses 1 page)
  maximum number of hosts in a list = (256 - 28)/2 = 114 hosts
                                      (28 bytes for ascii description)

Answer for question #3:
  Each class can handle 8 host or node lists.
  Each group can handle 8 host lists.

Answer for question #5:
  Each class/group requires 1 fullword
  Each node/host requires a halfword (2 bytes)

  Exception list does not increase the storage.
  If total size of Netval class/group table and its node/host exceeds the 
  size allocated in SUP then class/group table can not be sent.
