             ----------------------------------------------


        THE TYMNET REPORT GENERATOR (RPTGEN) PROGRAM GENERATES MONTH END
        REPORTS FOR TYMNET CUSTOMERS.  THE REPORTS ARE GENERATED FROM
        THE DETAIL FILES FOR EACH CUSTOMER SUPPLIED BY TYMSHARE. (THE
        D#####.TYM FILES: WHERE ##### = 5 DIGIT CUSTOMER NUMBER )

        THE FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF FILES THAT MUST RESIDE IN THE ACCG1
        DIRECTORY BEFORE THE RPTGEN PROGRAM CAN BE RUN.

                            PROGRAM OUTLINE
                            ---------------



        THIS PROGRAM PERFORMS THE FOLLOWING FUNCTIONS:

        1.      READS THE RPTGEN.MMM FILE.

        2.      BUILDS A CONTROL FILE.  (RPTGEN.CTL)

        3.      GETS A CUSTOMER NUMBER FROM THE CONTROL FILE.

        4.      EXECUTES PHASE 1 - LOADS THE DETAIL FILE FOR THE CURRENT
                CUSTOMER.

        5.      EXECUTES PHASE 2 - DEPENDING ON THE REPORTS TO BE
                GENERATED, UPDATES THE 1022 CUSTOMER DETAIL FILE.

                        A. FOR REPORTS 1 OR 4, ADDS ATTRIBUTES
                           CITY, STATE, DENSITY.

                        B. FOR REPORTS 2 OR 5, STRIPS PROJECT CODE
                           FROM USRNAM FIELD.

                        C.  FOR REPORTS 3 OR 6, NO UPDATING

        6.      EXECUTES PHASE 3 - GENERATES ALL REPORTS FOR CURRENT
                CUSTOMER.

                        A. GENERATES ONE REPORT.

                        B. UPDATES CONTROL FILE INDICATING THE REPORT
                           HAS BEEN GENERATED. GOES BACK TO 6.A.  UNTIL
                           ALL REPORTS FOR CURRENT CUSTOMER HAVE BEEN
                           GENERATED.

        7.      KEEPS REPEATING STEPS 3-6 UNTIL ALL CUSTOMER REPORTS
                HAVE BEEN GENERATED.                                                              Page  3   



                            PROGRAM COMMANDS
                            ----------------



        THE RPTGEN PROGRAM HAS ONLY TWO COMMANDS.  THE FOLLOWING IS A
        DESCRIPTION OF BOTH COMMANDS.

        1.      RUN - THIS COMMAND SHOULD BE ISSUED THE 1ST TIME THE
                PROGRAM IS TO BE RUN AT THE END OF EACH MONTH, OR IF THE
                WHOLE PROCESS MUST BE REDONE.  THIS COMMAND CAUSES THE
                PROGRAM TO START WITH STEP-1 OF THE OUTLINE.

                EXAMPLE:

                        - PERFORM RPTGEN
                          --------------

                        : RUN
                          ---

                        MONTH AND YEAR TO PROCESS? (MM,YY)  02,79
                                                            -----

                THE PROGRAM WOULD THEN GO AND CREATE ALL CUSTOMER
                REPORTS FOR FEB., 1979.

        2.      RESTART - THIS COMMAND SHOULD BE USED IF THE PROGRAM IS
                INTERRUPTED AT ANY POINT AFTER THE 'BEGINNING PHASE 1'
                MESSAGE HAS BEEN OUTPUT TO THE TERMINAL.  THERE ARE TWO
                DIFFERENT WAYS  TO RESTART THE PROGRAM: (A) RESTART THE
                PROGRAM AT EXACTLY THE POINT IT WAS INTERRUPTED. (B)
                RESTART THE PROGRAM AT A PHASE PRIOR TO THE ONE THAT WAS
                BEING EXECUTED WHEN THE PROGRAM WAS INTERRUPTED.  NOTE:
                      ALL PHASES FOR ONE CUSTOMER ARE COMPLETED BEFORE
                      THE NEXT CUSTOMER IS PROCESSED.

                TO RESTART IN CASE (A)
                ASSUME PROGRAM WAS INTERRUPTED IN PHASE 3

                        - GO RPTGEN
                          ---------

                        : RES
                          ---

                        RESTART WITH PHASE: 3
                                            -

                        MONTH AND YEAR TO PROCERSS? (MM,YY)  02,79
                                                             -----

                THE PROGRAM WOULD USE THE CONTROL FILE TO RESTART WITH
                THE REPORT IT WAS CREATING BEFORE THE INTERRUPTION AND
                CONTINUE FROM THERE.                                                              Page  4   



                TO RESTART IN CASE (B)
                ASSUME THE PROGRAM WAS INTERRUPTED IN PHASE 3 AND FOR
                SOME REASON YOU WANT TO REDO ALL OF THE CUSTOMERS
                REPORTS OR REDO ALL OF THE REPORTS STARTING WITH A
                PARTICULAR CUSTOMER. THEN, THE CONTROL FILE WOULD HAVE
                TO BE EDITED BEFORE RESTARTING THE PROGRAM.  SEE
                APPENDIX-D.  FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTROL FILE.

                THE 1ST VALUE OF EACH RECORD IN THE CONTROL FILE
                INDICATES WHICH REPORT WAS LAST COMPLETED FOR THAT
                CUSTOMER.  THEREFORE, AFTER THE PROGRAM WAS INTERRUPTED
                , IF THE CONTROL FILE LOOKED LIKE THE FOLLOWING:

                        10 04077 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
                         3 05536 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
                         0 04111 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0

                THEN ALL REPORTS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED FOR CUSTOMER 04077.
                UP TO THE 3RD REPORT HAS BEEN GENERATED ( OR CHECKED TO
                  SEE IF IT SHOULD BE GENERATED) FOR CUSTOMER 05536.
                AND NO REPORTS HAVE BEEN GENERATED YET FOR CUSTOMER
                04111.

                          EXAMPLES OF RESTARTS
                          --------------------


        BELOW ARE LISTED THREE EXAMPLES OF HOW TO MODIFY THE CONTROL
        FILE TO CAUSE THE PROGRAM TO RESTART AT DIFFERENT PLACES.

        **      TO REDO ALL REPORTS FOR ALL CUSTOMERS SET THE 1ST VALUE
                OF EACH RECORD TO 0. MAKING THE CONTROL FILE:

                        0 04077 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
                        0 05536 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
                        0 04111 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0

                THEN RESTART WITH PHASE 3 (OF COURSE PHASE 1 AND 2 WILL
                BE RE-EXECUTED FOR CUSTOMERS 05536 AND 04111)

        **      TO REDO ALL OF CUSTOMER 5536'S REPORTS AND RELOAD THAT
                CUSTOMERS DETAIL FILE, CHANGE THE CONTROL FILE TO:

                        10 04077 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
                         0 05536 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
                         0 04111 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0

                AND RESTART WITH PHASE 1.


        **      FINALLY YOU CAN ALWAYS CREATE YOUR OWN CONTROL FILE. FOR
                EXAMPLE AFTER THE PROGRAM COMPLETES RUNNING ALL REPORTS
                FOR ALL CUSTOMERS YOU MAY FIND YOU MUST REDO THE 2 AND
                4TH REPORTS FOR CUSTOMER 09111 AND THE 1ST REPORT FOR                                                              Page  5   



                CUSTOMER 05777.  SIMPLY CREATE THE FOLLOWING CONTROL
                FILE:

                         0 09111 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
                         0 05777 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

                MAKING SURE TO NAME IT: RPTGEN.CTL AND THEN RESTART WITH
                PHASE 1.                                                              Page  6   



                              APPENDIX-A.
                              -----------


                    DESCRIPTOR FILE FOR: RPTGEN.MMM


        THE REPGEN.MMM FILE IS A FREE FORMATTED FILE.  ALL FIELDS ARE
        SEPARATED BY COMMAS.  THE FIRST FIELD MUST BE THE 5 DIGIT
        CUSTOMER NUMBER.  THE CUSTOMER NUMBER IS FOLLOWED BY A LIST OF
        REPORT NUMBERS THAT ARE TO BE GENERATED FOR THAT CUSTOMER.
        AGAIN, THE REPORT NUMBERS SHOULD BE SEPARATED BY COMMAS.

                                EXAMPLE
                                -------

                        04077,1,5,6
                        03111,1
                        00112,1,2,3,4,5
        NOTE: MAXIMUM NUMBER OF REPORTS PER CUSTOMER = 10.                                                              Page  7
