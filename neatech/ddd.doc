I.            INTRODUCTION


    A.   OVERVIEW

         DDD, version 3.0 is located on system 43, an IBM-370 mainframe.  
         It is a simple program to use.  There really aren't any commands
         to remember.  DDD is self-prompting, so all you have to do is
         respond to each prompt. Each prompt is explained in detail through-
         out this documentation.  

         The purpose of the program is to allow users to calculate the DDD
         (Direct Distance Dialing) cost between two points:
         Origination phone number and terminating phone number.

         Tariff information is provided by CCMI- McGraw Hill.  The rate
         information and access phone numbers for Tymnet, Telenet, and
         Compuserve for the DDD program are updated on a monthly basis.  
         New area codes and prefixes are updated on a quarterly basis.  
         The rates used are business rates only.

         Within the new DDD analysis program itself, there are now
         three options:  Standard DDD Run, User Defined Node Run, and
         Interactive General Pricing.

         1.  THE STANDARD DDD RUN option is designed to determine the
             cost of using the TYMNET Public Network from calling areas
             within the United States and Canada excluding Alaska.

             DDD compares a list of customer/prospect telephone
             numbers against a pre-defined list of TYMNET access
             locations to determine the best TYMNET access location(s)
             based upon EITHER:

             A.   The lowest DDD costs.  (The cost to place a call)
         OR
             B.   The lowest ACCESS (overall) cost.  ACCESS cost
                  includes the Tymnet connect charges for high,
                  medium, and low density locations AS WELL AS
                  the DDD costs.  (See graph on page   for illus-
                  tration of differences.)

             DDD can also compare a list of customer/prospect telephone
             numbers against a pre-defined list of competitor access
             locations (Telenet and CompuServe) for a comparitive
             analysis.


         2.  USER-DEFINED NODE DDD was created to give the DDD user
             the option to analyze least-cost access not only for
             Tymnet or major competitors but also for any group of
             dial-up access numbers.

             When would you want to use User-Defined Node DDD?

             A.  To provide Competitive pricing against long distance
                 dialing.  If a customer is presently dialing (long
                 distance) directly to a main frame, you can provide
                 a comparitive cost analysis between their current costs
                 and costs of using Tymnet.

             B.  To analyze dialing costs between a public network and
                 a private network.  In some instances it might be cost-
                 effective for a private net user to dial in through a
                 Tymnet low-density node versus a private net node.

             C.  To provide a cost analysis against Competitors other
                 than Telenet and Compuserve.  Telenet's and Compuserve's
                 access numbers have been predefined in the Standard DDD
                 Run.

         3.  THE INTERACTIVE GENERAL PRICING option can be used to quickly
             price out different calling scenarios without having to create
             any input or node files.  The user, however, needs to know
             both origination and destination area codes and prefixes in
             order to run the Interactive General Pricing.


    B.   NEW FEATURES IN DDD, VERSION 3.0

         DDD version 3.0 has many new enhancements.  These enhancements
         will allow the user to provide more information based on customer/
         prospect DDD usage, thus, producing a more accurate picture of
         total DDD charges, ACCESS charges, and density distributions.

         NEW REPORTS - There are 4 reports available.  The user must select
         1 of the following 3 reports:  A standard report, a sequential flat
         file or a summary report.  The fourth report, an error report will
         automatically be created if errors are found in the DDD analysis.  
         All reports can be placed in a file or printed at the terminal.  A
         summary report is also provided with the standard report.  

         NEW SPEED CODES -  In addition to H, X, and L for 300/1200 BPS
         only, 2400 BPS only, and 300/1200 or 2400 BPS locations respect-
         ively (in previous versions of DDD); there is N for 9600 BPS only
         and M for MNP locations only.  

         PRICING OPTIONS - Rates for day, evening, and night calls are
         available in DDD, version 3.0 as well as peak and off-peak
         Tymnet access pricing.  Previous versions only provided day
         rates and peak pricing.  

         SPECIAL PRICING - When running the "A" option in the Standard DDD
         run, the user has the option to use Tymnet's standard pricing or  
         input special pricing rates that pertain to a particular customer 
         or prospect.

         INWATS - INWATS (800 service) is now an available option under
         both the "D" and "A" options in the Standard DDD run.  

         SECOND BEST ACCESS LOCATION - The user has the option of request-
         the DDD analysis program to choose the best or the best AND
         second best access location.

         LOCAL CALLING PLANS - The user can input the specific local
         calling plan the customer/prospect is currently using.

         RBOC NUMBERS - The Tymnet/RBOC phone numbers can either be
         included or excluded in the DDD analysis.  Some customers/prospects
         want the convenience of Tymnet's uniform log on while others
         want wider access and want the RBOC access numbers we gateway
         to.

         CARRIER OPTIONS - Pricing for AT&T, MCI, US Sprint, and Western
         Union are available in DDD, version 3.0 for long distance calling.  


    C.   IMPORTANT PROGRAM OPTIONS

         There are several important program options in the Standard DDD
         that should be noted:

         MEDIUM, LOW, OR WATS ACCESS LOCATIONS - If your customer does
         not want to pay additional surcharges (either Medium, Low or
         WATS), then you may instruct the program to ignore these sites
         during its analysis.  Depending on the calling locations, this
         could result in higher telephone bills for your customer's end
         users.

         WATS PEAK AND WATS OFF-PEAK BREAKPOINT PRICE - The DDD program
         program uses the standard Tymnet INWATS (800 Service) charges
         for analysis.  The user has the option to override the standard
         pricing and input a price of his own.  This function is useful
         when determining if a customer/prospect should use his own INWATS
         service priced at X vs Tymnet's local access number.

         2400 BPS ACCESS - If your customer is not considering 2400 bps
         service (the customer does not plan to purchase 2400 bps modems),
         then you may instruct the program to ignore 2400 bps sites.  

         COST CALCULATIONS - You may select whether you want the DDD prog-
         ram to select network sites based upon (1) The lowest DDD cost
         OR (2) The lowest total ACCESS cost (DDD plus Tymnet charges).  

         DEFAULT NUMBER OF CALLS AND HOLD TIME - The user can input the
         number of calls and hold time for each entry in the input file
         or the user can input a default number of calls and hold time,
         irrelevant of the locations, either in the input file or at the
         program prompts.  The user could also use the standard program
         default values which is 1 call for 3600 seconds per month.

         **CAUTION should be used when using a default number of calls
           and hold time, irrelevant of the location. DDD will not give
           an accurate cost quote for many customers/prospects.  The
           user is basically stating that there will be the same number
           of calls to a low or medium density site as to a high.  In
           most instances that assumption is not true.  By using default
           values, the summary reports showing the density distributions
           and percentages will also be inaccurate.  

         MNP ACCESS LOCATIONS - The user can include or exclude MNP sites.  


    D.   INITIATING THE DDD PROGRAM

         At the "please log in:" type your username followed by a colon,
         the system number (43), semi-colon, and your password.  Once you
         are on system 43, attach to the DDD directory.  A READ password
         is required (ask your manager or call Stephanie Hamik).  At the
         "43>" prompt, simply type "DDD" and the main menu will appear.

II.           STANDARD DDD RUN


    DDD is a simple program to use.  There really aren't any commands
    to remember.  DDD is self-prompting, so all you have to do is
    respond to each prompt. Each prompt is explained in detail through-
    out this documentation.

    This section contains the instructions on running The Standard DDD.  
    It demonstrates how to create an input file, what options are
    available for the input file, standard program options, and output
    report options.


    A.   CREATING THE INPUT FILE

         In order to run the Standard DDD option you must first create
         an input file under your username on system 43.  This file
         must contain, at the minimum, the required information necessary
         to run the DDD program.  

         The following information is contained in the input file:
         [Optional information is seen in brackets]

              S          =  Required modem speed; 1 character field
              NPA        =  Origination area code; 3 character field
              NXX        =  Origination prefix; 3 character field
            [ NC  ]      =  Estimated number of calls per month
                            Default is 1
            [ HT  ]      =  Estimated call length in seconds
                            Default is 3600
            [ TOD ]      =  Time of day call will be placed;
                            Default is 1 (day rates); 1 character field
            [ CARRIER ]  =  Carrier for long distance call handling
                            Default is ATT
            [ PLAN  ]    =  The local calling plan to use if available
                            Default is least cost plan; 1 character field

         The correct format for the Standard DDD input file is:

               SNPA/NXX                          (Using default values)
          or
               SNPA/NXX,NC,HT,TOD,CARRIER,PLAN   (all values specified)

         Maximum number of characters for each line of input is 30.


         1.   Speed  - This is a 1 character required parameter.  
              Any record missing this information will be disregarded
              and the record will appear in the error report.  

              5 possible speed codes:

                        H designates 300/1200 bps access only.  
                        X designates 2400 bps access only.  
                        L designates that you don't care what the
                          speed is, 300, 1200, or 2400 bps.  
                        N designates 9600 bps access only
                        M designates MNP locations are only.  


         2.   NPA (Area Code) - This is a 3 character required parameter.  
              Any record missing the NPA will be disregarded and will
              appear in the error report.

              The NPA is entered immediately after the one character
              speed code.  Any blanks or punctuations between the speed
              code and NPA will result in an error.  A slash (/) must
              follow the NPA and preceed the NXX.

         3.   NXX (Prefix) - This is a 3 character required parameter.  
              Any record missing the NXX will be disregarded and will
              appear in the error report.  A comma (,) must follow the
              prefix.

         4.   Number of Calls (Per Month) -  This is an optional parameter.  
              If not specified, DDD will assign the value of 1 call per
              month.  The user can override this default value at the
              prompt when running the DDD program.  If this field is used,
              a comma must separate the NXX and the number of calls.  

         5.   Hold Time (In seconds) -  This is an optional parameter.  
              If not specified, DDD will assign a default value of 3600
              seconds per call.  The user can override this default
              value at the prompt when running the DDD program.  If this
              field is used, a comma must separate the number of calls
              and hold time.

         ***  CAUTION  should be used when using a default number of
              calls and hold time, irrelevant of the location. DDD will
              not give an accurate cost quote for many customers/prospects.  
              The user is basically stating that there will be the same
              number of calls to a low or medium density site as to a high.  
              In most instances that assumption is not true.  By using
              default values, the summary reports showing the density
              distributions and percentages will also be inaccurate.  

         6.   Time of Day  -  This is an optional 1 character parameter.
              The optional values are:

              1  =  Daytime phone rates:  Monday through Friday 8:00 am to
                    5:00 pm; Peak network rates
              2  =  Evening phone rates:  Monday through Friday 5:00 pm to
               11:00 pm; Off-peak network rates.
              3  =  Nighttime phone rates: Monday through Friday 11:00 pm
                    to 8:00 am, plus weekends; Off-peak network rates.

              The default, if left blank, is 1.  As with the other options,
              a comma must be used to separate entries.

         7.   Carrier  -  This is an optional field for long distance calls.  
              If a carrier is selected, but is unable to carry the call, ATT
              is substituted.  If this field is left blank, ATT will be used.  

              Valid Carrier codes are: ATT, BOC, MCI, USP, and WU


         8.   Plan  -  This is a 1 character optional field.
              The available plans range from values 1 through 6.  If a
              plan is selected and not available, the default, the least
              cost plan, is substituted.

         If you want to use the default values for any optional field,
         a blank must be used followed by a comma to separate the
         entry.

         Information for each calling location must be on a separate
         line.  The following sample input will be used in the sample
         run.

         H213/498,10,3600,1, ,1
         L408/922, , ,2
         X313/855,22,150,3, ,2
         N312/986,6,280,1
         M404/390, , ,2


         The filename MUST be of the format:  FILENAME DATA A1.  
         "FILENAME" can be any name you want; however, the file
         MUST have the extension of DATA and have the disk address
         A1

         The input file may be created using editor on system 43, created
         on system 38 and telecopied to system 43, or created on your PC
         and uploaded to system 43.  (See section II - B for editing
         options).  


    B.   WHERE AND HOW TO CREATE THE INPUT FILE

         There are several ways to create your input file for the DDD
         program:  (1)  Create your file on the IBM system.  (2) Create
         your file on a PDP-10, system 38 for example, and telecopy the
         file to system 43.  (3)  Create the input file on a PC and up-
         load the file to system 43.  (4)  Have the customer/prospect
         supply you with the information on a mag tape.

         1.  The user need not be familiar with the IBM or its commands to
             create an input file on the IBM mainframe.  Listed below is an
             example of the EDITOR program showing how to create an input
             file.


                  --------------------------------------------------
                  |   43>EDIT TEST1 DATA A1                        |
                  |      NEW FILE:                                 |
                  |   E>I                                          |
                  |   I>H213/498,10,3600,1, ,1                     |
                  |   I>L408/922, , ,2                             |
                  |   I>                                           |
                  |   E>FILE TEST DATA A1                          |
                  |   R; T=0.01/0.03 20:33:16                      |
                  |   43>                                          |
                  --------------------------------------------------


             To execute the IBM Editor, simply type EDIT, the filename
             with filetype and disk address.  "E" signifies edit mode.  

             In the sample above, "TEST1" is the filename with the file-
             type "DATA". "A1" is the address of the file.  All files
             must have an address.  It will be less confusing if the user
             assigns address A1 to all his/her files.

             As mentioned earlier, all DDD input files must have the
             filetype "DATA".

             "I" in edit mode, stands for input.  As long as the user has
             the "I" prompt, everything that is being typed will be
             included in the file.  To write the file to disk, enter a
             carriage return at the input prompt "I" and file (save) the
             file to disk.


         2.  Creating a input file on a DEC PDP-10 and telecoping the file
             to system 43 is another option users have.  If this option is
             used, simply create the input file on system 38 or another
             PDP-10 and then use the "Telecopy" command to move a copy of
             the file to system 43.  When the file is telecopied to system
             43, the file will be given a filetype "TELECOPY".  The user
             must rename the file and give it a filetype "DATA".  

             Below, is a sample of this option with the necessary rename
             command:

                   -------------------------------------------------



         3.  Creating an input file on a PC and uploading the file to
             system 43 is probably the easiest method there is.   Create
             the input file in the correct format in a word processing
             software package and save the file in Ascii format.  Log on
             to system 43 and by using the "COPYPC" command, upload the
             file.  A sample of the "COPYPC" command is illustrated below.  
             COPYPC is only available if you are using TYMCOMM.  If you
             are using XTALK, use the "SEND" command to upload the file.


                  ---------------------------------------------------
                  |   please log in: YOURUSERNAME:43;               |
                  |   PROJECT CODE:.                                |
                  |                                                 |

                  ---------------------------------------------------


             WHERE: PCFILE represents the "From File".  The PC drive and
             sub-directory needs to be specified.  If the file is on
             drive C and sub-directory DOS, the format would be:

                       COPYPC C:\DOS\FILE IBMFILE DATA A1

             COPYPC can also work in the reverse.  A user can download an
             IBM file to the PC by switching the order of filenames.

                       COPYPC IBMFILE DATA A1 C:\DOS\FILE



         4.  Having a customer or prospect provide a mag tape with all the 
             necessary information to create an input file is a great time-
             saver, especially if the company is large and has many calling
             locations.  

             In order to load the mag tape on one of our mainframes, the     
             following information must be provided by the customer or
             prospect:

             A) Tape Density (ie. 900, 1600, or 6250 BPI)
             B) Must be a 9-Track mag tape
             C) Record Length 
             D) Blocking Factor or Block Size  
             E) Record Format of the File
                                                                      


    C.   STANDARD PROGRAM OPTIONS

         Standard program options, as they appear in the program, for the
         Standard DDD Run inlcude:

         -  Show best Tymnet location or best and second best (1/2)?

         An answer of 1 will result in best Tymnet location.  An answer
         of 2 will show the two best Tymnet locations.

         -  Price Telenet (Y/N)?
         -  Price CompuServe (Y/N)?

         An answer of YES will include competitor(s) costs in the
         output.  NO will exclude any competitor(s) costs.

         -  Ignore LOW density (Y/N)?
         -  Ignore MEDIUM density (Y/N)?
         -  Ignore 2400 service (Y/N)?
         -  Ignore MNP service (Y/N)?
         -  Ignore all RBOC nodes (Y/N)?

         A YES response to any of the above will exclude the subject
         of the prompt from DDD or ACCESS calculations.

         -  Calculate least expensive DDD or total access costs (D/A)?

         A "D" response will compute the least expensive solution for
         telephone charges for the NPA, NXX, and speed combinations
         given in the input file.

         An "A" response will compute the least expensive overall
         ACCESS charges.  Overall ACCESS charges are the DDD charges
         (calculated above) PLUS the Tymnet connect time charges
         (no volume discounts).  While it may be less expensive in
         phone charges to call a low density number, there is a much
         greater surcharge for the use of low density (or medium
         density) than the charges for high density.  The ACCESS
         option takes this surcharge into account and then finds the
         lowest overall cost solution.  

         -  Ignore WATS service (Y/N)?

         A YES response will ignore WATS and continue with the next
         prompt.  A NO response will include WATS during the DDD
         analysis.  Also a No response will result in two additional
         questions:

         -  WATS peak price breakpoint in tenths of cents per hour:
         -  WATS off-peak price breakpoint in tenths of cents per hour:

         The standard price is the INWATS surcharge plus the basic access
         rate charge if applicable.  This standard price is already built
         into the program for all networks for the ACCESS option. The user
         has the option to override the standard INWATS price and input
         override the standard INWATS price and input his own at these last
         two prompts.  To use the program default values, simply enter a
         carriage return.

          -  Default number of calls:
          -  Default hold time in seconds:

         If the user wants to override the number of calls and hold time
         that are currently in the input file, he can do so here, otherwise
         a carriage return is required to use the values in the input file
         or to use the program standard defaults.




    D.   OUTPUT REPORT OPTIONS

         There are 2 analysis options for the Standard DDD Run:

             a.  DDD output only
             b.  Total ACCESS

             Within each option, there are 4 different output reports
             available:

             a.  Report  - Produces the standard report format
             b.  Flat File -  Will produce a sequential flat file that
                 can be used for further analysis.  A flat file is where
                 all fields are listed on a single line for each record.
                 A sequential file makes sorting easier.
             c.  Error report -  Will automatically be created if errors
                 are found either in the input file or in the analysis.
             d.  Summary report - Can either be chosen by itself or be
                 included at the end of the standard report.


         These reports can be written to a disk file or printed directly
         to your terminal by entering a cariage return at the prompts.  
         If the user has placed the output report(s) to a file(s) on disk,
         the user must type the file out when the DDD run has completed.
         To type the file from disk, simply enter the command below:

                 --------------------------------------
                |  43> TYPE FILENAME LISTING A1 (CC    |
                 --------------------------------------

         The CC stands for control characters; When using this option, the
         control characters such as line feeds and carriage returns will be
         turned on.


         The following are the program's standard report prompts:

              -  Report of File ( CR for Report or F for file) :
                 A carriage return will produce the standard report
                 and a "F" will  produce a flat file.

              -  Enter Output Name ( Name or CR for terminal) :
                 A carriage return will result in the report printing
                 directly to terminal; For a disk output file, simply
                 type a filename.  No extension is necessary as the
                 program automatically give the extension of "Listing"
                 with address A1 for standard reports and an extension
                 of "FFile" with address A1 for flat files.

              -  Enter Error Report  (Name or CR for terminal) :
                 A carriage return will result in the error report
                 printing directly to terminal; For a disk output
                 error file, simply type a filename.  No extension is
                 necessary as the program will automatically give the
                 extension of "Listing" with address A1.

              -  Summary Ouput only (Y/N)?
                 A Yes will produce only a summary report and not a
                 standard report.  A No will attach the summary report
                 to the end of the standard report.











III.          USER DEFINED NODE RUN


    If you don't want to use the predefined access locations available
    in the Standard DDD Run, you can define your own access locations
    and run the DDD program using the User Defined Node DDD.

    This section contains the instructions on running User Defined Node
    DDD.  It demonstrates how to create the node file, an input file, and
    what output reports are available.  


    A.   CREATING THE USER DEFINED NODE FILE


         One file that is needed to run the User Defined Node DDD is the
         User Defined Node file.  This file should be created under your
         username on system 43 using Editor or created on a pc and up-
         loaded.  (See Section II - B for editing options).  

         This file is a simple file and contains the following infor-
         mation:

              NPA        =  Origination area code; 3 character field
              NXX        =  Origination prefix; 3 character field
              TRUNK      =  Last 4 digits of phone number

         All the information listed above is required.  There is no
         optional information in the node file and spaces are required
         between fields.

         The correct format and sample node file are listed below:

               NPA NXX TRUNK        or        408 922 3430


         The User Defined Node Filename must be of the format:
         FILENAME DATA A1, where the "FILENAME" can be any name
         you want; however, the file MUST have the extension of
         DATA and have the disk address A1


    B.   CREATING THE INPUT FILE


         Another file that is needed to run the User Defined Node DDD is
         an input file.  This file should be created under your username
         on system 43.  The following instructions are the same as the
         Standard DDD Run instructions for creating the input file with the
         exception of the Speed Code.  In a User-Defined Node run, the speed
         codes and flags are extraneous.  If you have already read the
         previous sections, you can skip to section IV.

         The input file must contain at the minimum, the required information
         necessary to run the DDD program.  

         The following information is contained in the input file:
         [Optional information is seen in brackets]

              NPA        =  Origination area code; 3 character field
              NXX        =  Origination prefix; 3 character field
            [ NC  ]      =  Estimated number of calls per month
                            Default is 1
            [ HT  ]      =  Estimated call length in seconds
                            Default is 3600
            [ TOD ]      =  Time of day call will be placed;
                            Default is 1; 1 character field
            [ CARRIER ]  =  Carrier for long distance call handling
                            Default is AT&T
            [ PLAN  ]    =  The local calling plan to use if available
                            Default is least cost plan; 1 character field

         The correct format for the Standard DDD input file is:

                NPA/NXX                          (Using default values)
          or
                NPA/NXX,NC,HT,TOD,CARRIER,PLAN   (all values specified)

         Maximum number of characters for each line of input is 30.


         1.   NPA (AREA Code) - This is a 3 character required parameter.  
              Any record missing the NPA will be disregarded and will
              appear in the error report.

              The NPA is entered immediately after the one character
              speed code.  Any blanks or punctuations between the speed
              code and NPA will result in an error.  A slash (/) must
              follow the NPA and preceed the NXX.

         2.   NXX (PREFIX) - This is a 3 character required parameter.  
              Any record missing the NXX will be disregarded and will
              appear in the error report.  

         3.   Number of Calls (Per Month) -  This is an optional parameter.  
              If not specified, DDD will assign the value of 1 call per
              month.  The user can override this default value at the
              prompt when running the DDD program.  If this field is used,
              a comma must separate the NXX and the number of calls.  

         4.   Hold Time (In seconds) -  This is an optional parameter.  
              If not specified, DDD will assign a default value of 3600
              seconds per call.  The user can override this default
              value at the prompt when running the DDD program.  If this
              field is used, a comma must separate the number of calls
              and hold time.

         ***  CAUTION  should be used when using a default number of
              calls and hold time, irrelevant of the location. DDD will
              not give an accurate cost quote for many customers/prospects.  
              The user is basically stating that there will be the same
              number of calls to a low or medium density site as to a high.  
              In most instances that assumption is not true.  By using
              default values, the summary reports showing the density
              distributions and percentages will also be inaccurate.  

         5.   Time of Day  -  This is an optional 1 character parameter.
              The optional values are:

              1  =  Daytime phone rates:  Monday through Friday 8:00 am to
                    5:00 pm; Peak network rates
              2  =  Evening phone rates:  Monday through Friday 5:00 pm to
                    11:00 pm; Off-peak network rates.
              3  =  Nighttime phone rates: Monday through Friday 11:00 pm
                    to 8:00 am, plus weekends; Off-peak network rates.

              The default, if left blank, is 1.  As with the other options,
              a comma must be used to separate entries.

         6.   Carrier  -  This is an optional field for long distance calls.  
              If a carrier is selected, but is unable to carry the call, ATT
              is substituted.  If this field is left blank, ATT will be used.  

              Valid Carrier codes are: ATT, BOC, MCI, USP, and WU


         7.   Plan  -  This is a 1 character optional field.
              The available plans range from values 1 through 6.  If a
              plan is selected and not available, the default, the least
              cost plan, is substituted.


         If you want to use the default values for any optional field,
         a blank must be used followed by a comma to separate the
         entry.

         The input file may be created using editor on system 43, created
         on system 38 and telecopied to system 43, or created on your PC
         and uploaded to system 43.  (See Section II - B for editing
         options).

         Information for each calling location must be on a separate
         line.  The following sample input will be used in the sample
         run.

         213/498,10,3600,1, ,1
         408/922, , ,2
         313/855,22,150,3, ,2
         312/986,6,280,1
         404/390, , ,2


         The filename MUST be of the format:  FILENAME DATA A1
         "FILENAME" can be any name you want; however, the file
         MUST have the extension of DATA and have the disk address
         A1




    C.   OUTPUT REPORT OPTIONS

         This section contains detail information regarding the output
         options.  The report options are identical to the Standard DDD
         run.  If you have read the previous sections, you can skip onto
         Section IV.

         There are 4 different ouput reports a user can request for the
         User Defined Node Run:

             a.  Report  - Produces the standard User Defined report
             b.  Flat File -  Will produce a sequential flat file that
                 can be used for further analysis.
             c.  Error report -  Will automatically be created if errors
                 are found either in the input file or in the analysis.
             d.  Summary report - Can either be chosen by itself or be
                 included at the end of the standard report.

         These reports can be written to a disk file or printed directly
         to your terminal by entering a cariage return at the prompts.  
         If the user has placed the output report(s) to a file(s) on disk,
         the user must type the file out when the DDD run has completed.
         To type the file from disk, simply enter the command below:

                 --------------------------------------
                |  43> TYPE FILENAME LISTING A1 (CC    |
                 --------------------------------------

         The CC stands for control characters; When using this option, the
         control characters such as line feeds and carriage returns will be
         turned on.


         The following are the program's standard report prompts:

              -  Report of File ( CR for Report or F for file) :
                 A carriage return will produce the standard report
                 and a "F" will  produce a flat file.

              -  Enter Output Name ( Name or CR for terminal) :
                 A carriage return will result in the report printing
                 directly to terminal; For a disk output file, simply
                 type a filename.  No extension is necessary as the
                 program automatically give the extension of "Listing"
                 with address A1 for standard reports and an extension
                 of "FFile" with address A1 for flat files.

              -  Enter Error Report  (Name or CR for terminal) :
                 A carriage return will result in the error report
                 printing directly to terminal; For a disk output
                 error file, simply type a filename.  No extension is
                 necessary as the program will automatically give the
                 extension of "Listing" with address A1.

              -  Summary Ouput only (Y/N)?
                 A Yes will produce only a summary report and not a
                 standard report.  A No will attach the summary report
                 to the end of the standard report.

    C.   SUMMARY REPORTS

              The report output option always creates a summary report
              at the end of the standard report.  A summary report is
              also available without the standard report.  This can be
              useful for quick referencing.

              The summary report provides a breakdown of all the calls
              by density classification.  It provides, by density, the
              total DDD charges, ACCESS charges and TOTAL charges if
              applicable, number of input records, number of local calls,
              total hours, and the percent breakdown.

              Summary information is calculated using the best access
              location information.  It does not include the second
              best access location.

              An example of a summary report follows:

    D.   FLAT FILE OUTPUT FORMAT

         In order to interpret and use the output from the FLAT FILE, the
         column numbers and size of each field are needed.  This information
         is listed below.  For the Standard DDD run, use the column numbers
         on the left; For the User-Defined Node run, use the column numbers
         on the right.  

VI.           ERROR MESSAGES AND REPORTS


    As mentioned in previous report sections, the error report is auto-
    matically generated by the DDD program when there are any errors
    either in the input file or found during the analysis process.

    At the following DDD prompt:

            Enter Error Report (Name or CR for terminal) :

    The user is requested to either enter a carriage return to print
    all errors directly to the terminal or to a filename.  If the user
    specifies a filename, a filetype is not needed.  The DDD program
    will assign the filename a filetype of "Listing" with an address    
    of A1.

    If the user has placed the error report to a file on disk, the user
    must type the file out when the DDD run has completed.  To type a file
    from disk, simply follow the command below.  

      43> TYPE FILENAME LISTING A1 (CC

    The CC stands for control characters;  When using this option, the
    control characters such as line feeds and carriage returns will be 
    turned on.



    Listed below are a few sample errors a user might find in an error
    report.  The important errors will be "Invalid NPA/NXX ...combinations"

    Errors, such as "Toll Call Pricing error = 07" can usually be disregarded.
    An "07" error infers that service for that call is not Included in our
    database; The service it usually refers to is for Independent Operating
    Companies  (IOC) versus Bell Operating Companies (BOC).  In the instance
    of "07" error, the DDD program will price the call through a BOC but
    will give an error message for each time the program tried to price the
    call using an IOC.




       DDD input error in line     3 - L619/342
          Toll Call Pricing error = 07 for calling parameters

VII.          INTERACTIVE GENERAL PRICING OPTION


       The INTERACTIVE GENREAL PRICING option can be used to quickly price
       out 1 or more calling scenarios.  This option is self-prompting and
       does not require the user to create an input file.  The only infor-
       mation the user if required to provide is the origination area code
       and prefix, destination area code and prefix, and the length of the
       call (in minutes).  Other information that is prompted for is 
       optional and the default values can be used by simply entering a
       carriage return at the prompts.

       The information that will be requested in the Interactive General
       pricing option is listed below.  All default values are contained
       in brackets [].

       Origin Area Code
       Origin Exchange
       Destination Area Code

                                           Default is current day
       [ Call TOD Class ]                  Time of Day of call; Default
                                           is 0.
       [ Call Duration ]                   Length of call in minutes;
                                           Default is 1 minute
       [ Carrier Code ]                    Carrier for call; Default is ATT
       [ Service Type ]                    How the Call is made; Default is
                                           D for Direct Dial
       [ Monthly Volume in Dollars ]
       [ Local Calling Plan ]              Default is 0
       [ Check for local call? ]           Flag if call is local; Default
                                           is Yes.
       [ Return mileage? ]

       [ Check for carrier availability? ] Flag for Carrier Requested; Default
                                           is Yes.




       The Interactive General Pricing option will provide rate information
       such as minimum minutes / minimum charges and overtime minutes /
       overtime charges as well as total charges for the call based on the
       user's response to the prompts.  This option will also list the
       various local calling plans that would be available for that parti-
       cular call.

VIII.         HELPFUL HINTS AND QUESTIONS


    A.  VARIOUS CMS COMMANDS

        The list of IBM commands below will be very helpful to users who
        are new to the IBM environment.


               LIST  - Is synonomous to the "DIR" command on the PDP-10s.
                       "LIST" will display all files in the user's direc-
                       tory. Variables of the "LIST" command include:

                     - LIST TEST * A1 - Will display all files named TEST
                       with any filetype and address A1.

                     - LIST TEST INPUT A1 (L - Will list the named file as
                       well as various information pertaining to that par-
                       ticular file such as disk address, format, record
                       length, number of records, number of blocks, creation
                       date and time.  

               ERASE - Will delete a file(s).  In order to erase a file,
                       the filename (at least in part) needs to be speci-
                       fied.  

                     - ERASE TEST * will delete all files named test with
                       any filetype.  

               TYPE  - Will print to a terminal any file specified.  The
                       complete filename must be used.  Wild characters (*)
                       will not work.  

              RENAME - Will rename a file to another filename.

                     - RENAME TEST1 DATA A1 TEST1 INPUT A1
                       (Renamed the file TEST1 filetype DATA on the A1 disk
                        to file TEST1 filetype INPUT on the A1 disk)

              Q DISK - Will show the user how many blocks of storage and
                       what percentage of storage has been used.

                COPY - Will make a copy of the file or can be used to
                       change record format and record length.

                     - COPY TEST1 INPUT A1 (RECFM F LRECL 80
                       In this example, the record format is changed to
                       F for fixed and record length 80.

       <ESC> <CR> HX - To log out of the program at any time during
                       execution and return to the 43> prompt.

                       DO NOT type <ESC>, instead enter the escape key.
                       <CR> stands for carriage return.  HX is typed at
                       the ??> prompt.

               LOG -   Will log the user off the system.



    B.  COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS


    Q.   Does the program reflect Tymnet's recent price changes?
    A.   Yes.

    Q.   My customer has collected key information on tape.
    A.   Please have your customer create their tape with the data in the
         format described on page  .  Make sure to get the tape spec infor-
         mation.  Contact Stephanie Hamik for further instructions.  

         If your customer does not create the tape with the data in the
         required format, there is still a possibility of reformatting
         the data into the necessary format.  This will require time
         and programming effort to reformat the data.  Please remember that
         our resources at HQ for special requests are very limited.  

    Q.   I called my local telephone company to price a call.  The answer
         they gave me is not identical to the answer the DDD program
         provides.  What's wrong?
    A.   The best way to price a local call is through the local operator.  
         To reach a local operator in another area or state is a little
         tricky.  Dial 0-NPA-555-1212, where "NPA" is the origination area
         code for the call you wish to price out.
          
         Another way is to call the billing department of the local operating
         company which serves the origination area code/prefix.  Calling a
         long distance operator or an operating company which is non-local
         to your local call will not provide correct information.  If you
         are suspicious about DDD reate information, please call Stephanie
         Hamik immediately.  CCMI has committed itself to providing accurate
         data.

    Q.   DDD doesn't appear to calculate total access costs using our volume
         discounts.  Is that so?
    A.   Yes.  Volume discounts may be added in a subsequent version of DDD.  

    Q.   DDD doesn't appear to be working correctly.  What should I do?
    A.   Contact Stephanie Hamik immediately and report the problem.  Please
         attempt to duplicate and document the steps preceeding the problem
         to assist us in our debugging efforts.  

    Q.   Can I interrupt DDD while it is working?
    A.   Yes.  You many stop DDD by pressing the Escape [ESC] key which will
         prompt back with two questions marks "??>"  At the question marks,
         type "HX" to return to the 43> prompt.  You may either log out at
         this point or type "DDD" to initiate the menu again.




    C.   TIPS ON RUNNING DDD

         In order to use DDD most effectively, make sure you:

         1.   Create your input file name with the extension "DATA"
              and disk address A1

         2.   Place all your input options in the correct sequence.  

         3.   Don't put usernames or directories in () when you answer
              the input or output questions.  The program automatically
              looks in the directory you are logged into for input files
              and will place output files in the same directory.

         4.   Have plenty of time to run DDD.

              a.   Try to avoid short term commitments unless the file
                   is small.

              b.   Files are updated every night on system 43.  If you
                   are logged overnight, the updates can not be done.  

              c.   Divide and Conquer!  In severe time constrained
                   situations, break a single large input DDD file into
                   several smaller (less than 100 entries) files using
                   editor.  Smaller files will be executed quicker than
                   larger ones.
