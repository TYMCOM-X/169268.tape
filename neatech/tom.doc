          TOM User's Guide                                     January 4, 1983



          SECTION 1.0 OVERVIEW          ____________________

          The TYMCOM Operations Manager (TOM) is a process used to monitor and
          manipulate various dynamic options of  the ISIS Asynchronous TYMCOM.
          The ISIS Asynchronous TYMCOM runs in  a slot under ISIS.  A terminal
          connected to  the TOM will  receive  all diagnostic  messages output
          by the TYMCOM  and  can be  used to  receive status  reports on  the
          host  processes  and the  ports associated   with the slot.   It can
          also be used to affect these statuses.

          The TOM  may  be accessed  through  a  local hardwired  port  on the
          ISIS machine, or by logging in  through the network.   The number of
          hardwired ports and their positions may be changed by  using the TOM
          Assign command  (see Section 3.1).   However, the maximum  number of
          users that may be  logged into the TOM at any  one time is specified
          at system generation.


          SECTION 1.1 Access Levels and Configuration Options          ___________________________________________________

          Change license is the ability to alter the status of the TYMCOM.  It
          is obtained by exercising the  Grab command.  Any terminal connected
          to the  TOM may receive  diagnostics and TYMCOM  status information,
          but only a user with change  license may affect the configuration of
          the TYMCOM.  Only one user at a time can have change license.

          TOM commands  are divided into three  levels.  Level 0  commands are
          always accessable.  Level  1 commands are accessable  after assuming
          change license via the Grab command (see Section 2.4).  Level 2 com-
          mands are only accessable by logging in  to the TOM using a particu-
          lar username and assuming change license.   Level 2 commands are not
          accessable through the hardwired TOM ports.

          The special username may be changed  with the TOMGG(username) state-
          ment in the configuration file.  The  default name is !##TOM##.  The
          username  is ##TOM##,  the exclamation  point  (!) is  added by  the
          Supervisor for shut override status.

          The TOMCL(level,command) statement in the configuration file is used
          to increase the level of a command.  Level 0 commands may be changed
          to level 1 or  2.  Level 1 commands may be changed  to level 2 only.
          Level 2 commands may not be changed.

          Commands  that  are  initially level   0  are described  in  Section
          2.0.  Commands   that  are   initially level   1  are  described  in
          Section 3.0.  Commands  that  are  initially level  2  are described
          in  Section 4.0.

          TOM User's Guide                                     January 4, 1983



          SECTION 1.2 Hardwired TOM Ports          _______________________________


          Asynchronous ports and  SIO ports can  be directly  connected (hard-
          wired) to  TOM ports.   A hardwired  port allows  access to  the TOM
          without the  necessity of  building a  circuit through  the network.
          Should a failure occur  in the network, the TOM user  with a connec-
          tion through a hardwired port can always access the TOM.

          A hardwired  TOM port is  a port that has  been assigned to  the TOM
          subhost (subhost 0)  either in the Tymfile  or by a TOM  Assign com-
          mand.  On normal asynchronous ports, when a terminal is connected to
          a hardwired TOM port  (DSR and CD are raised), the  port returns the
          message "please type  your terminal identifier".  The  user can then
          type a  terminal identifier,  as with  a TYMSAT,  and the  port will
          respond with the TOM greeting message  and the user will be directly
          connected.  On SIO ports, the port responds immediately with the TOM
          greeting when a terminal is connected.

          Only ASCII terminals are supported on hardwired TOM ports.


          SECTION 1.3 Format          __________________

          Most commands require  that either hosts, subhost  ordinals (SORDs),
          or ports be listed.

          Hosts and SORDs define sets of ports  which are connected to differ-
          ent processes.  A network  host is a collection of one  or more sub-
          processes.  In the TYMCOM, the  SORDs are numbered sequentially from
          zero.

          Ports  are numbered  sequentially  starting  from  zero.   These are
          logical  port numbers.   Their  relationship  to  the  physical port
          numbers  associated   with  the  hardware    depends  on   the  ISIS
          configuration.  Each asynchronous logical unit  is 16 ports and each
          SIO  logical unit  is one  port.  The  SIO ports  always follow  the
          asynchronous ports.


          SECTION 1.4 Command Syntax          __________________________

          Only the  first two characters of  a command are interpreted  by the
          TOM.  Any remaining characters of the command are discarded, and are
          only included  for clarity.  Each command  is terminated by  a space
          or, when there  are no parameters,  a carriage return.  Commands may
          be entered in upper or lower case.

          The following notation is used to describe the command syntax.

          UPPERCASE      Minimum required  segment of  a command  or parameter
                         that must be entered.

          lowercase      Optional segment of a command word or a variable.


                                                            OVERVIEW    Page 2


          TOM User's Guide                                     January 4, 1983



              { }        Braces enclose  an item  or a list  of items,  one of
                         which must be chosen.  The braces are never entered.

              [ ]        Brackets enclose an optional item,  or list of items,
                         one of which may be  chosen unless specifically over-
                         ridden.  Brackets are never entered.

               |         Represents an  "or" choice  between optional  values.
                         It is never entered.

          In most commands in which a SORD  or port number is required, one or
          more single  numbers, one  or more inclusive  ranges of  numbers, or
          both, may be specified.  This specification is indicated in the com-
          mand syntax as  a range.  A range  must be specified as  two numbers
          separated by a hyphen.  If more than  one number or range of numbers
          are  specified,  they must  be  separated  by commas  (for  example,
          1,10-15,18,27-30).

          Hosts are not  numbered sequentially.  Therefore, when  host numbers
          are specified in  a command, ranges are not permitted.   If a series
          of host numbers is specified, the numbers  must be separated by com-
          mas (for example, 1,3,4).

          When the  TOM cannot  interpret a command  (for example,  an invalid
          command or incorrect  syntax), the command will be  ignored, and the
          TOM will  respond with  a question  mark (?).    Also, if  a command
          requiring change  license is entered by  a user which does  not have
          that license, the command will be  ignored, and the TOM will respond
          with a question mark.


          SECTION 1.5 Special Characters          ______________________________

          There are  two characters  which  have  special significance  to the
          TOM.  These are the escape character and the carriage return.


          1.5.1 Escape                ______

          On most terminals  the <ESC> or <ALT MODE> key  perform the function
          of the escape  character.  Additionally, any ASCII  character with a
          hexadecimal value in the  range 00 to 1F (except for  0D, which is a
          carriage return) and  7B to 7F  (control characters) will  be recog-
          nized by the  TOM as an escape character.  The  escape character may
          be entered at any time.











                                                            OVERVIEW    Page 3


          TOM User's Guide                                     January 4, 1983



          When an escape is entered, diagnostic  messages are temporarily sus-
          pended.  Diagnostics  will resume when  the next carriage  return is
          entered, or  after a one minute  timeout has expired.   Gobblers are
          sent out on the line.  Any command being entered is aborted, and any
          commands that may have been typed ahead are flushed and ignored.  If
          a command was  being executed, any pending terminal  output from the
          command is discarded.  The TOM indicates it is ready to accept a new
          command by returning a ">" prompt.

          The TOM  operates in full duplex  mode.  Therefore, commands  may be
          entered at any time even though diagnostics may be printing.


          1.5.2 Carriage Return                _______________

          A  carriage  return  causes  the current   command  (if  any)  to be
          executed.   Diagnostic output  is resumed,  unless  output has  been
          turned off.  (See Section 2.1 for the command used to turn output on
          or off.)

          SECTION 2.0 LEVEL 0 COMMANDS          ____________________________

          The following Level 0 (zero) commands do not require change license.
          Some of  the Level 0  commands alter the  status of the  terminal at
          which they  are issued  by turning  diagnostic messages  off, or  by
          changing the  radix in which numbers  are output.  However,  they do
          not alter the  status of the TYMCOM or its  associated hosts, SORDs,
          or ports.


          SECTION 2.1 Diagnostics Command          _______________________________

          Syntax:  DIagnostics {OFf|ON}
          Default:  On
          Description:  This command turns the printing of diagnostic messages
               at the terminal on and off.  Note that messages sent from other
               TOM  terminals with  the TO  command are  not suppressed  while
               diagnostics are off (see Section 2.10).

          Example:

               >di of

               >


          SECTION 2.2 Enquire Command          ___________________________

          Syntax:  ENquire
          Description:  This  command is  used for  tracing circuit  problems.
               The output  from this  command is in  two portions.   The first
               gives the  TYMCOM version number  and revision level,  the slot
               and node  numbers of  the TYMCOM, the  ISIS version  number and
               Kernel host number.  The second part  shows, in table form, the
               numbers of  the logical  units assigned to  the ISIS  slot, the
               devices assigned, the physical port numbers on the machine, and
               the logical port numbers the TYMCOM uses.

               For normal asynchronous  logical units, the device  is shown as
               "ASY" followed by the async group  number and then the physical
               port numbers which are related to the async group number.

               For SIO logical units, the device is shown as "SIO" followed by
               the SIO mother-board device address  and then the physical port
               number of the interface card port.

               >


          SECTION 2.3 Exit Command          ________________________

          Syntax:  EXit
          Description:  This  command is  used to  log the  user off  the TOM.
               Other users logged on to the TOM are uneffected.

          Example:

               >ex


          SECTION 2.4 Grab Command          ________________________

          Syntax:  GRab [password]
          Default:  Releases change license
          Description:  This command accesses change  license if a password is
               entered, or releases change license  if the password is omitted
               and the user  is the current holder of license.   Only the user
               with change license may execute commands which alter the status
               of the TYMCOM, hosts, SORDs, or ports.

               In order to prevent confusion, it is  advisable to let the cur-
               rent  holder of  license   know that  you  are   going to  grab
               license.  The WHO command allows a user to find out if any user
               logged into the  TOM holds license (see Section  2.11).  The TO
               commllows  a user to send  advisory messages to  that user
               (see Section 2.10).

               Note that a null password will look like a Grab command without
               a password to the TYMCOM.

          Example:

          SECTION 2.5 Password Command          ____________________________

          Syntax:  PAssword {old_password}
          Default:  Null
          Description:   This command  changes  the  password needed  to  Grab
               change license.  The  current password must be  included in the
               command.  The TOM will prompt twice for the new password, which
               may contain  up to  seven characters.   Any  characters  except
               carriage return, space, question mark, and the escape character
               may  be  included.  Lower  case characters  are  equivalent  to
               upper  case   in the  password.   The  new password  should  be
               entered within one minute after the prompt, otherwise a timeout
               will occur and the command will be aborted.

          Example:

               >pa charles
               ENTER PASSWORD:  snoopy
               AGAIN:  snoopy

               >


          SECTION 2.6 Radix Command          _________________________

          Syntax:  RAdix {Decimal|Hexadecimal|Octal}
          Default:  Decimal
          Description:  This command  sets, for this user only,  the radix for
               all numbers input to and output  from the TOM.  The radix value
               may be decimal, hexadecimal, or octal.

               Note:  Host numbers are always decimal,  regardless of the cur-
               rent radix.

          Example:

               >ra h

               >


          SECTION 2.7 Status Command          __________________________

          Syntax:  STatus [Full] [H host_list|S sord_range|P port_range]
          Default:  Lists status of all hosts, SORDs, and ports.
          Description:  This  command is  used to  list information  about the
               current state of the TYMCOM.  When the command is entered with-
               out parameters, Status Full Hosts is assumed, and all hosts are
               listed.

          TOM User's Guide                                     January 4, 1983



               When "STatus  Hosts" is  requested, a list  of the  host status
               (UP, DOWN, or  SHUT), is followed by the  SORD numbers assigned
               to that host.  The status of each SORD is indicated by the let-
               ter U, D, or S (for UP, DOWN, and SHUT) following the SORD num-
               ber.  Host numbers are  always decimal, regardless of  the cur-
               rent radix.

               Note:  The network Supervisor log may show one of  four differ-
               ent  states   for  a  host.    They  are   "UP   AND ANSWERED",
               "UP AND   SHUT", "DOWN",  and "GONE".  The  TOM refers  to  the
               first three   states as "UP",   "SHUT" and "DOWN".   The "GONE"
               state occurs  when a  host  number is  removed from  the TYMCOM
               with the change command  or if the node leaves the network.

               When the TYMCOM is initialized, the TOM host is  set to "UP AND
               ANSWERED".  The  status of all other   hosts  is set to "UP AND
               ANSWERED" after  a delay of  three minutes unless  their status
               has  been  changed by  a  TOM command  during the  three minute
               delay.

               When  "STatus  Full  Hosts" is  requested,  the  list  includes
               information about the SORDs and ports assigned to each host, in
               addition to  the host  status.  When the  listing for  SORDs is
               requested, the SORD number, status,  four character host greet-
               ing, and subhost indexes, are  indicated.  When the listing for
               ports is  requested, the  port number,  port status,  candidate
               type (Ifup or Signal), permitted  terminal types, and permitted
               baud rates,  are indicated.   (The first  host name  is usually
               specified as "TOM".)  This command  generates the most complete
               status listing.  It  is the default listing and  will appear if
               the command is entered without parameters.

               When "STatus  Sords" is requested,  the list includes  the SORD
               number,  host number,  SORD status  (UP, DOWN,  or SHUT),  four
               character greeting name  (from the "xxxx is  ON LINE" message),
               and subhost indexes.  If no SORD number is specified, all SORDs
               will be listed.

               When "STatus  Full Sords" is  requested, the list  includes the
               information  given  by  the Status  SORDs  command,  the  ports
               assigned to each  SORD requested, and the status  of each port.
               If no SORD number is specified, all SORDs will be listed.

               When "STatus  Ports" is requested,  the list includes  the port
               numbers and port  status for each port  requested.  Port status
               is indicated  by the letters  U, D, S, A,  or V (for  UP, DOWN,
               SHUT, ACTIVE,  and VESTIGIAL, respectively).   ACTIVE indicates
               that the port is UP, and that a circuit to it exists.  A VESTI-
               GIAL port is one  which has been shut, but still  has an active
               circuit.  If  no port  number is specified,  all ports  will be
               listed.

               When "STatus  Full Ports" is  requested, the list  includes the
               port numbers and the port status,  the candidate type, the SORD
               number, valid  terminal types,  and speed  types for  each port
               requested.  Candidate  type is  SIG for  ports which  require a
               signal (usually  DTR) high for  assignment, and IFUP  for those
               that only need to be UP to  be assigned.  See the Speed command
               for speed types (Section 3.6), and the Types command for termi-
               nal types (Section  3.7).  If no port number  is specified, all
               ports will be listed.

          SECTION 2.9 Time Command          ________________________

          Syntax:  TIme
          Description:  This command outputs the current  date and time to the
               terminal, in the form:

                    ddmmyy hh:mm:ss

               where ddmmyy is  the day, month, and year, and  hh:mm:ss is the
               hour, minute, and second.

               If the time zone is set to  Greenwich Mean Time (either at sys-
               tem generation or by the Zone command), the time is followed by
               the letters "(GMT)".

               The timestamp is also output automatically at an interval spec-
               ified at system generation, unless diagnostics have been turned
               off.   This unsolicited  timestamp is  preceded  by the  string
               "FFF:".  Time is  output for the zone selected  when the TYMCOM
               was  generated, unless changed with  the Zone command.

          Example:

               >ti

          SECTION 2.10 To Command          _______________________

          Syntax:  TO {tom_user_range} {"text"}
          Description:  This  command sends  the  message   text  to   the TOM
               user numbers specified in the TOM user range.  No error message
               is generated if a user number specified is not currently logged
               into the TOM.  The Who command provides the facility for deter-
               mining user numbers.  The message  delimiter  (")  may  be  any
               single  nonnumeric character except  blank, carriage  return or
               escape characters.  A  carriage return will terminate  the mes-
               sage.  The message length is limited to one line or 120 charac-
               ters.  The final delimiter may be omitted.

               The message  received by the  specified  TOM users  is preceded
               by "nn>>", where  "nn" is  the user number of  the user issuing
               the command.  The  message is received whether  diagnostics are
               on or off.

               This command should always be issued prior to the Grab command,
               to advise the current holder of change license that you wish to
               access license (see Section 2.4).

          Example of outgoing message:

               >to 2 "Is it OK if I grab change license?"

               >

          Example of incoming message:

          SECTION 2.11 Who Command          ________________________

          Syntax:  WHo
          Description:  This  command lists user  numbers for  users currently
               connected to the TOM.  The TOM user number issuing the WHO com-
               mand is followed by an asterisk; the user currently with change
               license is followed by the letter "L".

          SECTION 3.0 LEVEL 1 COMMANDS          ____________________________

          The following Level 1 commands require  change license (that is, the
          TOM user  must "GRAB" change license  first).  Level 1  commands are
          used to alter the status of the TYMCOM's associated hosts, SORDs, or
          ports.


          SECTION 3.1 Assign Command          __________________________

          Syntax:  ASsign {port_range} To {sord_number}
          Description:  This command  assigns ports within the  specified port
               range to the specified SORD number.  If a port in the specified
               range is currently active, an error  message will be issued and
               the entire command will be ignored.  If  no ports in the speci-
               fied range are currently active, the  ports will first be deas-
               signed from  any SORD to  which they were  previously assigned.
               If no SORD number  is specified, the ports  specified are deas-
               signed, but not reassigned to any SORD.

          Example:

               >as 8-9 t 2

               >


          SECTION 3.2 Candidate Command          _____________________________

          Syntax:  CAndidate {port_range} {Ifup|Signal}
          Description:  The  parameter Ifup  declares ports  in the  specified
               range to be candidates for circuit assignment if they have been
               declared up with the Up command (see Section 3.8).

               The parameter Signal  declares ports in the  specified range to
               be candidates for circuit assignment if they have been declared
               up with the Up  command, and if the customer's  machine is pre-
               senting a high signal (usually DTR) to the port.

          Example:

               >ca 1-3 s

               >

          SECTION 3.3 Down Command          ________________________

          Syntax:  DOwn [H host_list|S sord_range|P port_range]
          Description:  This  command causes  the specified  hosts, SORDs,  or
               ports to be set down.  The network Supervisor will be informed.
               For hosts, current users are not  affected, but the host is not
               available for  new logins.   For SORDs,  current users  will be
               dropped.  The SORD for  the TOM may be SHUT, but  it can not be
               brought  DOWN.  For  ports,  current  users are  dropped.   For
               hosts, individual host numbers must  be specified, separated by
               commas.  Inclusive ranges  may not be specified.   Host numbers
               are always decimal, regardless of the  current radix.  The Sta-
               tus command  contains additional  host status  information (see
               Section  2.7).  For  SORDs and  ports, the  parameters must  be
               specified in ranges.

          Example:

               >do p 9-15,23-26

               >


          SECTION 3.4 Message Command          ___________________________

          Syntax:  MEssage {sord_range} {"text"}
          Description:  This  command sets message text  to be printed  at the
               terminal of any user who attempts to log into a specified SORD,
               regardless of  the SORD's current  status.  The command  may be
               used to  advise users  of current SORD  status or  planned down
               time.  However,  the message  will only be  sent if   the hosts
               associated  with the  SORDs are  UP.    Otherwise, the  message
               "HOST DOWN" or "HOST  SHUT" is sent to the user  by the network
               Supervisor, whether or not "text" is defined.

               Everything between the first occurrence  of the message delimi-
               ter (") to  the second occurrence of  the same message  delimi-
               ter   is  sent   exactly   as   typed, including  any  carriage
               returns, linefeeds,   etc.  The  message  delimiter may  be any
               nonnumeric  character except  blank,  carriage  return, or  the
               escape characters.  The message text may not be longer than 157
               characters.  Once the carriage return  is entered for the first
               line of the message, the message should be completed within one
               minute, otherwise a timeout will occur  and the command will be
               aborted.

               If "text" is omitted, the message  area for the specified SORDs
               is cleared.  The Status Messages  command provides the facility
               for determining the message text currently  in effect (see Sec-
               tion 2.8).

          SECTION 3.5 Shut Command          ________________________

          Syntax:  SHut {H host_list|S sord_range|P port_range}
          Description:   This command  shuts the  specified  hosts, SORDs,  or
               ports to  any new users unless  they have Shut  Override status
               for their username.  For hosts and SORDs, current users are not
               affected.  For ports,  current users are not  affected, but the
               port is no longer a candidate for assignment.  For hosts, indi-
               vidual host  numbers must  be specified,  separated by  commas.
               Inclusive ranges may not be  specified.  See the Status command
               for additional host status information  (see Section 2.7).  For
               SORDs and ports, a range must be specified.

          Example:

               >sh s 1

               >

               Note:  Shut override status has no effect on shut ports.

          SECTION 3.6 Speed Ports Command          _______________________________

          Syntax:  SPeed {rate} {P port_range}
          Description:  This command indicates the  baud rate that  the TYMCOM
               will use when  it communicates with the async  host ports.  The
               specified ports will communicate at the specified speed regard-
               less of the types of terminals permitted to log into the ports.
               Thus the TYMCOM may then communicate with the host and the ter-
               minal at  different speeds.

               The allowed  values for "rate",  other than  FULL (F) or BAUDOT
               (B) are specified in the following chart.  If "F" is specified,
               the full  range of  speeds associated  with the  terminal types
               allowed by the Types command (see Section 3.7) is supported for
               the ports  in the range specified.   A baud rate  which matches
               the terminal  baud rate is selected  each time a user  logs in.
               Note that "B"  may be specified for SIO ports  only, and causes
               the port to use Baudot protocol.

               If a "rate" other than one listed below is specified, or if the
               specified rate is not supported by  the ISIS Kernel on the node
               in which the TYMCOM resides, then  the command is aborted and a
               "?" is printed at the user's terminal.

          SECTION 3.7 Types Command          _________________________

          Syntax:  TYpes {type} {P port_range}
          Description:  This command specifies the terminal types that may log
               in to the specified ports.   Types that were previously allowed
               to log in  are disallowed, unless respecified  by this command.
               The terminal types are listed in the following chart:

          SECTION 3.8 Up Command          ______________________

          Syntax:  UP {H host_list|S sord_range|P port_range}
          Description:  This command brings up  the specified hosts, SORDs, or
               ports.  Hosts  are always  decimal, regardless  of the  current
               radix.  For hosts,  individual host numbers must  be specified,
               separated by  commas.  Inclusive ranges  may not  be specified.
               For SORDs and ports, a range must be specified.

          Example:

               >up p 0-7

          SECTION 3.9 Zone Command          ________________________

          Syntax:  ZOne [+|-]{number_hours}
          Description:  This command changes the  bias of the timestamp output
               so that corrections can be made.   The bias should be specified
               in number of hours preceded by a  plus sign (+) or no plus sign
               for a positive  number, or by a  minus sign (-) for  a negative
               number.  A positive number designates a time differential for a
               location East of Greenwich, England.   A negative number desig-
               nates a  time differential  for a  location West  of Greenwich,
               England.  The  Zone command changes  the default time  zone for
               all  users logged  in to  the TOM.   The time  zone remains  in
               effect until the  TYMCOM is reinitialized, or  the Zone command
               is reissued.

          SECTION 4.0 LEVEL 2 COMMANDS          ____________________________

          Level  2 commands  are  only accessable  by logging  in  to the  TOM
          through the network using a particular username and assumming change
          license.  Level 2 commands cannot be changed to other levels.


          SECTION 4.1 Change Host Command          _______________________________

          Syntax:  CHange {old_host_number} To {new_host_number}
          Description:  This command changes the old  network host number to a
               new network host number.  The new host  is set to a SHUT state.
               Existing circuits are  not affected.  The old  host is reported
               as  "GONE".  The  host numbers  are always  stated in  decimal.
               Only one  individual host  number may  be specified;  neither a
               series of numbers nor  inclusive ranges of numbers  are permit-
               ted.

          SECTION 5.0 DIAGNOSTIC MESSAGES          _______________________________

          Diagnostic messages  are sent  to all  users connected  to the  TOM,
          except those that have turned diagnostics off.

          In the following  sections, the default message text  is shown.  The
          user has the option  of specifying alternate text  at system genera-
          tion.


          SECTION 5.1 All Ports Down          __________________________

          The All Ports Down (APD) message occurs  when a user attempts to log
          into a SORD whose ports are all DOWN.  The message is generated only
          if the  circuit to the  TYMCOM is completed.   If all ports  for all
          SORDs on  a host  are DOWN,  that host  is reported  to the  network
          Supervisor as  SHUT, even though no  TOM command has been  issued to
          SHUT the host.  In such a case,  the circuit to the TYMCOM would not
          be completed, and  the Supervisor message "HOST SHUT"  would be sent
          to the user (except  in the case of Shut Override  status).  The APD
          message appears in the form:

               sss:  ALL PORTS DOWN

          where sss is the number of the SORD whose ports are DOWN.


          SECTION 5.2 No Ports Available          ______________________________

          The No Ports Available (NPA) message  occurs when a user attempts to
          log into  a SORD which  does have some  active (UP) ports,  but none
          available for circuit assignment.  The message appears in the form:

               sss:  NO PORTS AVAILABLE

          where sss is the number of the SORD with no available ports.


          SECTION 5.3 Ring No Answer          __________________________

          The  Ring No  Answer (RNA)  message occurs  when the  host fails  to
          respond to a ring from a port.  The message appears in the form:

               sss:  RING NO ANSWER ON PORT ppp

          where sss is the SORD to which the  port is assigned, and ppp is the
          number of the port which was not answered.

          The number of seconds the TYMCOM will ring a port before disconnect-
          ing the user is specified at system generation.

          Note:  The  SORD number will be  printed in whatever radix  has been
          set for  this session, but  the port number  will be printed  in the
          radix set at system generation (see Section 2.6).

          SECTION 5.4 Invalid Username          ____________________________

          The Invalid Username (IUN) message occurs when a username containing
          an unknown subhost index is detected.  This  may happen if the posi-
          tion of  the subhost index  within the  username does not  match the
          position determined by TYMCOM option SINDXP,  whether by an error in
          username validation, or in the configuration of SINDXP.  The message
          is in the form:

               FFF:  USERNAME INVALID, DISCONNECTING

          Since the circuit was never completed, neither a SORD or port number
          is applicable.  (FFF does not stand for anything.)


          SECTION 5.5 Access Not Permitted          ________________________________

          The Access Not Permitted  (ANP) message occurs if  the TYMCOM state-
          ments BARNOD  or OKNODE  were specified  at system  generation.  The
          message appears in the form:

               sss:  ACCESS FROM THIS NODE IS NOT PERMITTED

          where sss is the  number of the SORD to which  access is disallowed.
          Note that this message only reports that a login to a specified SORD
          has been attempted from  a node defined as having no  access to that
          SORD.


          SECTION 5.6 No Host Acknowledgement          ___________________________________

          The No Host Acknowledgement (NHA) message occurs when the host fails
          to acknowledge a user disconnect on  a port.  The message appears in
          the form:

               ppp:  HOST DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE USER DISCONNECT

          where ppp is the port number.



          SECTION 5.7 Dropped For Inactivity          __________________________________

          The Dropped For Inactivity (INA) message occurs  when a port is dis-
          connected because the inactivity timer  has expired.  The message is
          in the form:

               ppp:  DROPPED FOR INACTIVITY

          where ppp is the port number.
