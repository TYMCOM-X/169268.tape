        TYMCOM OVERVIEW

        The ISIS Asynchronous TYMCOM  provides a set of individual asynchro-
        nous line interfaces to an attached  host computer.  It appears to a
        host computer as a bank of  asynchronous dial-up modems or asynchro-
        nous terminals, depending  on  the  configuration. The  TYMCOM  uses
        asynchronous I/O  boards (async  ports) and   SIO motherboard  cards
        (SIO ports). The  asynchronous ports use EIA  RS-232 signal protocol
        supporting  8 bit  or 5  bit characters. SIO  ports  use EIA  RS-232
        signal protocol supporting 8 bit characters  or  using  a subset  of
        X.20  protocol  supporting  5  bit characters.

        The TYMCOM can be configured using one of two speed ranges which are
        as follows:
        
             (1)  50 - 75   baud Baudot              (async)
                  75 - 1200 baud ASCII               (async)
                  75 - 9600 baud SIO ASCII or Baudot (SIO)
                           or
             (2)  300 - 4800 baud ASCII               (async)
                  75  - 9600 baud SIO ASCII or Baudot (SIO)

        The TYMCOM allows up to 128 async and  SIO ports  to  be  specified.
        The ports can be grouped  into  several  useful  ways  allowing  for
        great flexibilty. Each group of ports  is referred to  as a SUBHOST.
        Up to 128 subhosts may be specified for  the entire  TYMCOM and  the
        ports  in  each  subhost may  be dynamically  reassigned to  another 
        subhost using the TYMCOM OPERATIONS MANAGER (TOM).
        
        The TYMCOM is normally located on-site with  the host computer hard-
        ware.
        
        The following pages  are questions  concerning  the  TYMCOM  options
        as  well  as questions  concerning the asynchronous configuration of
        the host(s). If any assistance is needed, please do not  hesitate to
        contact  the  TYMNET  communication  consultant  assigned  to   your 
        account.

                           ASYNCHRONOUS TYMCOM INTERFACE
                               D I S C U S S I O N 


      This section is an expanded discussion of each of  the questions  in 
      configuration requirement sheet and the subhost option sheet.



        A. The asynchronous TYMCOM can be configured to appear to the host
           as a bank of dial-up modems or as a set of hardwired terminals.
           The following is a description of the 2 configurations:
           
              a. AS A BANK OF DIAL-UP MODEMS: When the TYMCOM has
                 a call for a host port, it will raise the RI sig-
                 nal and it will expect the host computer to raise
                 DTR  signal  on that port. In response to DTR set
                 high, the  TYMCOM will either drop the RI singnal
                 or keep it high depending on  the  options chosen
                 and  then  bring  up  DSR, CTS and CD signals. At
                 this point data transfer between the  TYMCOM  and
                 the host computer can take place.
            
                 The host can disconnect the user by lowering DTR
                 for at least one-half second. The TYMCOM will lo-
                 wer DSR,CTS and  CD  when  a  network  disconnect
                 occurs. This configuration is normally used.

              b. AS A SET OF HARDWIRED TERMINALS: When the TYMCOM
                 has a call for  a  host  port, it will raise the
                 BUSY signal and it will expect DSR and CD signals
                 from the host. ( The host  will normally set DSR
                 and CD high for ports that  are  available ). In
                 response to DSR and CD  being  high, the  TYMCOM
                 will  raise  DTR. At  this  point  data  tranfer
                 between the TYMCOM and the host can take place.
                 
                 The host can  disconnect the  user  by  lowering
                 DSR and  CD  for at  least  one-half second. The
                 TYMCOM lowers  DTR  when  a  network  disconnect 
                 occurs.

              c. NONE OF THE ABOVE: If the host does not  conform
                 to any of the above, provide a detailed descrip-
                 tion of the host signal handshake process.

        B. Indicate the total number of HOST computer systems that will be
           connected to the TYMCOM. Computers from different manufacturers
           may be connect to the TYMCOM since the TYMCOM can be configured
           to be compatible with each of these computer systems.
           
           If the  host system has a  front  end  processor, indicate  the
           make and  model. If more space is required, please  use a sepa-
           rate  sheet  of  paper  to completely describe the host system.

                               D I S C U S S I O N 


        C. Enter the total  number of  ports that will be connected to the
           TYMCOM. Include  additional ports that  will  be  required  for
           future growth. The TYMCOM can support 128 ports maximum.
           
        D. The ports on  the TYMCOM  can grouped  into subhosts  with each
           group having  different options  specified. Indicate the number
           of subhosts that are needed. Specify 1 subhost if the ports are
           not going to be split into 2 or more groups.

        E. The  TYMCOM uses a  subhost  index  to  determine which subhost
           it will assign a port from. There are 2 general methods used to
           select a subhost. These methods are described below.
           
                a. BY NETWORK HOST NUMBER - A subhost may be assigned
                   a network host number and usernames that are homed
                   to  this  host  number  are  allowed access to the
                   ports in this subhost. The subhost may be optioned
                   to  do  further  checking  on   the  username  for
                   security  reasons. In  this  case,  a  2 character
                   subhost  index   may  be specified. Only usernames
                   which end with these 2  characters will be allowed
                   access to the ports.

                b. BY NETWORK USERNAME INDEX - This method is normally
                   used when  there are  2 or  more  subhosts  defined
                   under a network host number. The subhost from which
                   a port is to be assigned is selected by the subhost
                   index(s)  assigned   to   each   of  the  subhosts.
                   The  subhost  index  is  a 2 character alphanumeric
                   string  that  is  associated with a  subhost.  Only
                   usernames with the last  2  characters matching one
                   of the subhost indexes will  be  allowed  access to
                   the ports in that subhost. A  maximum of 10 subhost
                   indexes may  be  specified  per subhost.  Duplicate
                   subhost indexes are not allowed.
                   
                c. If  no  subhost  indexing  is  specified, the ports
                   in this subhost is accessible to all usernames that
                   have access to the network  host number under which
                   this subhost is  defined. Only one such subhost can
                   be defined per network host number.

        F. HOST NO
           Specify the network host number that will used for the subhosts
           to be defined. Leave blank if none specified.

           SUBHOST INDEX
           Specify the 2 character subhost  index(s) (see  explanation  in
           b. above). These  subhost  indexes  should  match  the  last  2 
           characters of the username(s) allowed to access  the  ports  in
           this subhost.

           GREETING MSG
           The TYMCOM sends the user an "XXXX IS ON LINE" greeting message
           immediately after the call is successfully established with the
           host. The XXXX is  a  4 character alphanumeric string which can
           be used  to  identify the host or subhost. The default is "HOST
           IS ON LINE". Specify  the  4  character  string  if the default 
           string is not used.           

           Note: The "XXXX IS ON LINE " is the default  string and  may be
           replaced by a more appropriate string suited to the  customer's
           liking. The string can be 157 characters long. For example, the
           following strings may replace the default string:

                "XXXX IS NOW ACTIVE"
                "XXXX READY"
                "YOU ARE NOW ATTACHED TO XXXX"
                "WELCOME TO XXXX COMPUTER CENTER"

           where "XXXX" is an optional character  string  as  described 
           above.
           If the greeting message other than the "XXXX IS ON LINE" message
           is going to be used, specify the greeting message to be used  in
           the space provided.

           PORTS
           Specify the ports that will be assigned to each subhost. The
           ports may specified individually or in ranges.

        1. Enter the subhost number(s) to which  the  options  apply. More
           than  one subhost  number can  be specified  IF the options for
           each of the subhosts are identical.
           
        2. List all ports assigned to the  subhost(s). The  ports  may  be 
           specified  individually  or  in  ranges  for  contiguous   port
           numbers. If  2  or  more  subhosts  are  specified in 1  above, 
           indicate to which subhost the ports are to be assigned.

        3. Specify  the  ports  and  the  speed  type(s) these ports  will
           communicate with the host. Use the table below to determine the
           speed types to be used.

           For autospeed detect type ports, specify the character(s) which
           the host requires to determine the  speed  at  which to set its
           port. If none is required, explain how the host determines  the 
           speed to use. The TYMCOM will set  the port  speed to  the same 
           speed that the terminal is running.

           EXAMPLE:     Ports 1 to 5, 7 and 15 to 20 will be set up to
                        communicate at 1200 baud.

                        Ports 8-14 will be set up for 300 baud.

                        Ports 21 to 31 are autospeed detect type ports.
                        Character  to  send  to  the  host  for   speed
                        determination  is a carriage return with parity
                        bit set to 1.

                         Autobaud character is CR (8D)

           If more space is needed, please use a separate sheet of paper to
           completely specify the  speeds and  attach  it  to this  subhost
           option sheet.

        4. Specify the  terminal  speeds/types  that  will  be  allowed  to
           access  the  ports in this subhost. This option can also be used
           to restrict  terminals  running  at  a  particular speed(s) to a
           subset  of  ports  in  this  subhost.  Use  the  table  below to
           determine  the  terminal  types.

        5. There are generally 2 methods in which  DTR is  presented  on a
           port  that  is  available for  use. In the first method, DTR is
           always  high  on  ports  that  are  available. The TYMCOM takes
           advantage of this condition (if optioned to do so) and will not
           assign  ports  which  do  not  have  DTR  high  since  it  will
           consider  these ports inoperative. In the second method, DTR is
           set  high  only  when  RI (ring  indicator) signal is raised or
           toggled. The TYMCOM cannot  distinguish  between  an  operative
           port from an inoperative port and will attempt to ring the port
           for a predetermined period. If DTR is not raised by the host by
           the end of this period, the  TYMCOM  will send the user a "ring
           no answer message".
           
           Indicate which  method  the  host  uses  when presening DTR. If
           neither of these 2  methods  are  used,  explain  how  the host
           presents DTR.

        6. In this configuration, the  TYMCOM  checks  both  DSR and CD to
           determine if a  host  port is  operative. Indicate how the host
           presents these 2 signals on ports that are available for use.
           
        7. This questions is self explanatory.
           
        8. Indicate whether 2741  type  terminals  using  either  EBCD  or
           correspondence  code  are  going  to be used to access the host
           through the TYMCOM.
           
        9. The  TYMCOM  has  the ability to either toggle the RI signal or
           hold it high  continuously  when  attempting  to "ring" a port.
           Indicate how the TYMCOM should present the RI signal.
          
       10. Indicate  the length of time in seconds that  the TYMCOM should
           attempt to  "ring"  a  host port before aborting the call. When
           the call is  aborted,  the user will receive a "ring no answer"
           message and followed by the "Please log in:" prompt.
           
       11. Some host computers require  that the RI signal remain high for
           the duration of  the session with the host. Indicate how the RI
           signal should be set during the session.

       12. Flow control in a  network  environment  is  necessary to avoid
           over  writing  the network  buffers. Indicate what flow control
           mechanism  the  host  uses while  outputing data to the TYMCOM.
           The  TYMCOM  supports   the  standard  XON/XOFF  flow   control
           mechanism using the control-Q and control-S characters.The flow
           control characters may be changed to match the ones used by the
           host. In addition  to  the  XON/XOFF  mechanism, a polling type
           flow  control  mechanism  is  also  supported as used in the HP
           block  mode.  Indicate  which  mechanism  is  used. If  none is
           supported, expect some data loss while transmitting large files.

       13. The TYMCOM can be set up to respond to the XON/XOFF  characters
           sent by the host to control the flow of data  it  is receiving.
           Indicate   if   this  option  is  required,  and  the  XON/XOFF
           characters to be used.
           
       14. The TYMCOM can provide  a  delay  between the moment the signal
           hankshake  process  is  complete  and  the moment it will start
           sending data  to  the host. Some host  computers  require  this
           delay  to  prepare  for  receiving  data. Indicate  the   delay
           required in seconds.

       15. The TYMCOM can send the  host a  text message which the  host  may
           use for  preliminary processing.  For example, the  host may  need
           a CR to invoke a banner message or the host may want to accumulate
           some network information or the host may want to  double check the 
           network username. The text messages that contain such information,
           are sent to the host when the call is  first  established  between
           TYMCOM and the host. The messages that can be  sent are  described 
           below.
           
           ISIS NEEDLE - The TYMCOM will send a copy of the isis needle which
           contains the following information and is formatted as shown:


                    16 bit ISIS port number
                    16 bit length of remaining needle (including username)
                    32 bit invoice number
                    16 bit destination host number
                    16 bit originating node number
                    16 bit originating host number
                    16 bit originating port number
                    24 bit reserved field (for future expansion)
                     8 bit throughput class (gouging level)
                    16 bit dialect code
                     8 bit terminal identifier
                     8 bit size of username (including carriage return or
                       semicolon)

           USERNAME OF USER - The TYMCOM will send the host the network
           username only.

           TEXT MESSAGE - The TYMCOM will send the host a "canned" text
           message. If a "canned" is to be sent, specify the message in
           the space provided.

       16. Echoing of characters on  the  user's  terminal  is  handled in
           several  ways. Each method is  described below. Indicate  which
           method(s) will  be used. If none these  apply, describe how the
           host or terminal handles echoing.

           NETWORK ECHO - The  network will provide the character echoing.
           This  is  the  recommended  setting  since  the  delay  due  to
           character echoing is negligible.
           
           HOST ECHO - The host computer will provide  all  the  character
           echoing. This  method  produces  noticable  delays in character
           echoing since the characters will have to be transmitted to the
           host and back to the terminal. 
           
           TERMINAL ECHO - The  terminal provides all the echoing. Neither
           the  host  nor  the network  will  attempt  to  do any echoing.
           This setting is usually not recommended since the user will not
           be aware  of transmission errors caused by local telephone loop
           problems.

       17. This question is self explanatory.
       
       18. The TYMCOM can be set up to allow the host computer to turn net-
           work echo on and off by sending the TYMCOM a predefined echo ON
           and echo OFF character. This option can be used to prevent pass-
           words during host singons  from being  displayed on  the user's
           terminal. If the host will use this option, specify the echo ON
           and echo OFF characters.
           
       19. The TYMCOM can be set up to allow the user to turn network echo
           on and off by sending the TYMCOM a predefined echo ON  and echo 
           OFF character. If this  option  is  required  by  the  user(s),
           specify the echo ON and echo OFF characters.
           
       20. If any characters other than all  displayable ASCII characters,
           carriage return and linefeed need to be echoed to the terminal,
           specify them here.
           
       21-22. Self explanatory.
       
       23. The TYMCOM can be set up to remove certain characters in the data
           stream coming from the host and will NOT be sent to the terminal.
           For example, if the host sends several hundred pad characters (7F) 
           when it is sending a printout to a terminal, the  pad  characters
           are processed as data when transmitted in the network. These  pad
           characters may not be used by the terminal and  become "overhead"
           characters. These pad characters can be removed by the TYMCOM.
           
       24. Same as 23 but data is coming from the terminal going to the host.

       25. The TYMCOM can be set up so that host can place it in transparent
           mode where NO data inspection or  modification will  be  done  by 
           sending the TYMCOM an "enter transparency character" . This char-
           acter can be a  hexidecimal value  in the  range 00-7F. Once  the
           TYMCOM is in this mode, it will remain that way until the end  of
           the session.If this option is required, specify the character  to
           be used.
           
       26. Same as 25., but the character will be sent by the user.
       
       27. The TYMCOM allows a character to be defined so that it can be used
           as a disconnect character  by the user. When  a  user  types  this
           character, the TYMCOM will tear the  circuit down  and lower  DSR,
           CTS and CD. This is useful if the host  cannot disconnect  a user.
           If this option is required,  specify the character  to be  used in 
           the range 00-7F.
           
       28. The TYMCOM allows a character to be defined so that it can be used
           to "flush" the user's circuit of any characters waiting to be sent
           to the terminal. This is useful when the character defined is also
           used by the  host  to  terminate  a  process. If  this  option  is 
           required, specify the character to be used in the range 00-7F.
           
       29. Indicate if BREAK is used by the host. BREAK is a spacing state in
           the line. Some hosts use this as an interrupt key. If  it is  used,
           explain how it is used  and  what the  host  response  is  when  it
           receives a BREAK.

       30-31 Self explanatory.
       
       32. An inactivity period can be set in  the  TYMCOM  which  causes the
           TYMCOM to disconnect the user if no data is passed  in either  di-
           rection in this length of time. This  option  is used as a measure
           to prevent any terminals from being accidentally left logged in to
           the host. If this option  is  going  to be used, specify the inac-
           tivity period in seconds.
           
       33. The TYMCOM requires the host to drop DTR  for at  least  one  half
           second to  indicate  that  the  host  has  acknowledged  the  user 
           disconnecting. If the host does not acknowledge the user disconnect
           by dropping DTR, the TYMCOM will wait for a specified time. If  at
           at  the  end  of this period, the  host  does  not  drop DTR,  the 
           TYMCOM can either release the  port or "hang"  the port  until the 
           host  drops  DTR.  Specify  how  the  TYMCOM  should  handle  this 
           situation.
           
       34. Self explanatory.
