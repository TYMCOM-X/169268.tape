-----------------------------------------------------------------------


FOLLOWING ARE SEVERAL TOPICS WE'D LIKE TO DISCUSS IN OUR MEETING OF AUGUST
20TH.

- CODING OF PORTS

- REALIGNMENT OF PORTS - IE. ORIGINALLY RESERVED OCTAL PORT 1-10 BUT 5-15 WAS
   ACTUALLY INSTALLED.

- STATUS OF MDC BEING MOVED OFF `INTERNAL' MACHINES.

- PATHING OF PORTS ORDERS (CORRECT GROUP?)

IF YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL TOPICS, PLEASE ADVISE.

THANKS MUCH
