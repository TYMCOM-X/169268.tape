                                  1.1  INTRODUCTION






                  1.1.1  WHAT IS HALF-DUPLEX ?

           Half-Duplex operation  is similar to  the original CMT   mode of
      operation, Full-Duplex.  Both  are character mode that  one character
      at a  time is  sent from the   terminal to   CMT.  The  difference is
      echo:  in Full-Duplex  the network   must echo  (either CMTI   or the
      Consat)   and  in  Half-Duplex  the   terminal   itself   echoes each
      character.  Thus  the terminal must  have certain local  functions in
      order for the  local echo to work correctly  and not to destroy parts
      of  the  screen.  Escape sequences are not echoed in either mode.

           Terminals  can work  in Half-Duplex  if they  have  the  ability
      to support  locally controlled  protected areas  on the  screen,  and
      have sufficiently flexible  local editing functions.   Otherwise, the
      terminal would be used in a Full-Duplex mode.

           So far there are only two terminal types  supporting half-duplex
      mode.  They are ADDS 60 and TYMNET78.  TYMNET78 is one of the Softerm
      emulations and is run in half-duplex mode on the PC.  TYMNET78 is the
      extension of ADDS 60 hal-duplex,  but it has more features  than ADDS
      60 half-duplex has including  25th status line usage,  color monitor,
      buffered screen mode operation, and the faster screen display.





                  1.1.2  ADVANTAGES OF HALF-DUPLEX

           Half-Duplex mode   gives a response   time advantage   since the
      local   echo   means   that  local   editing   functions   like  tab,
      insert character, delete character,  etc all occur immediately.   The
      operator  does not   have  to wait   for  a network   response  to an

      escape sequence.  This  is of  particular  use when the   terminal is
      located far  away from the echoing interface, such as  between Europe
      and the USA,  or through multiple networks.

           There  are  also  less escape   sequences  for  the  operator to
      remember, since the local functions are all key-labeled.





                  1.1.3  DISADVANTAGES OF HALF-DUPLEX

           Due to  terminal limitation, some  half-duplex terminals  do not
      support certain features  or functions as  3270 does.  Since  ADDS 60
      HDX terminals have  no ability to  support numeric lock  feature, CMT
      will not be implemented for this feature.

           Usually users  are not  allowed to enter  data on  the attribute
      position, but  in ADDS  60 HDX you  can enter  data on  the attribute
      position of the unprotected field.

           In addition, users will get  the slow "please log in"  prompt in
      ADDS 60 when the circuit  is zapped during the insert mode.   This is
      because of  local terminal  buffer overflow in  the insert  mode.  In
      order to get rid of this situation, users should press the INS  C key
      to toggle off insert mode and then enter a login string.

           One thing we should take notice that the password will be showed
      up on the screen of ADDS 60 HDX due to the terminal local echo.

                                  1.3  LOGON TO CMT


           In  order  to  preserve Tymnets  login  security  of non-display
      passwords, the terminal  configuration for TYMNET78 should  start off
      in  full-duplex mode.   After users  log into  CMT as  usual  and the
      terminal type has been selected, CMT then down loads ESC sequences to
      turn the terminal into half-duplex mode.

           But the ADDS 60 terminal will be initially set up in half-duplex
      mode due to the terminal limitation.

           The  followings are  the  logon procedures  for  CMT  half-dplex
      mode.





                  1.3.1  LOGON TO CMT FROM ADDS 60


       1. The user must set up his terminal in half-duplex mode.

       2. Enter a control-H before the username to force the CONSAT into
          half-duplex mode. Now the password will be showed up on the
          screen due to terminal local echo.

       3. After loggin into CMT, select the half-duplex-mode ADDS 60
          terminal type when the select terminal type menu is present.






                  1.3.2  LOGON TO CMT FROM TYMNET78


       1. The user must set up his terminal in full-duplex mode.

       2. Logon same as normal logon without entering a control-H.

       3. After loggin into CMT, select TYMNET78 HDX.

                   1.4  FUNCTION KEYS IN FULL-DUPLEX MODE OPERATION


           Most of the 3270  functions are supported by CMT.   This section
      will list  the 3270  funcitons that CMT  supports in  the Full-Duplex
      mode operation.  The functions of  TYMNET78 HDX are based on  most of
      the 3270 functions.





                  1.4.1  CLEAR SCREEN

           The screen is cleared  locally, CMT clears its  internal  screen
      and the host is notified.  The cursor is moved to the  first position
      on the screen.





                  1.4.2  ZAP CIRCUIT

           CMT  will  zap the  circuit  and the  operator  is  returned  to
      'please log in :'.  For TYMNET78 HDX, the users is returned  to full-
      duplex mode and off insert mode.

           This function is invoked   by entering a control  sequence  from
      the keyboard.





                  1.4.3  ENTER

           The application  program  is  notified that  an  ENTER  function
      has been requested.  Areas  of  the screen  that have   been modified
      by  the operator  are reported  back to  the application,  as  is the
      current cursor position.

      cursor is located in an  attribute character location or is  within a
      protected data field causes an input-inhibit condition.

           This function is handled   locally by the terminal and   the CMT
      updates its internal screen buffer.





                  1.4.5  RESET

           The function in  3270 or CMT Full-Duplex mode  operation  can do
      either one of the followings :

           1. Exit out insert mode.

           For  the  ADDS  VIEWPOINT  60  terminal,  in   Half-Duplex mode,
      exiting  from the  insert mode   is by  striking the  INS C   key  on
      the keyboard.

           2. Unlock the keyboard.

           Normally  the  keyboard  is locked  when  any  transmit   key is
      struck.   A  subsequent  message   from  the  host  will  unlock  the
      keyboard.  In some cases this  may not happen. Then the  operator may
      use  the  RESET key  to unlock  the keyboard.   When the  keyboard is
      considered  locked by CMT, the only entry from the  terminal operator
      that will be accepted is  the  RESET  key. All  other   entries  will
      be  ignored  and  the cursor position remains unchanged.

           In SNA  environment,  RESET  function also  turns off  -F status
      item.





                  1.4.6  TAB

           The function moves  the  cursor to  the  beginning of   the next
      unprotected field.   The cursor  wraps to the  first position  of the
      first unprotected field if TAB is entered when the cursor in the last
      unprotected field.

           This   function   is  handled  locally   and  CMT   updates  its
      current cursor position in the internal screen buffer.

                  1.4.7  BACK TAB

           The function moves  the cursor backward  to the beginning  of an
      unprotected field. If the  cursor is already at the beginning   of an
      unprotected field,  or if it   is in a  protected field,  the  cursor
      moves to the beginning  of  the preceding unprotected field;  at  the
      beginning of  the screen,  it wraps  around  to the  last unprotected
      field.    If  the  cursor  is  past  the  first  position  within  an
      unprotected field, it moves to the beginning of the current field.

           This  function  is handled   locally  by the  terminal  and  CMT
      updates its current cursor position in the internal screen buffer.





                  1.4.8  CURSOR SELECT

           The   function    allows     the    selector-light-pen-detection
      function to be performed from a keyboard.

           This function is invoked   by entering a control  sequence  from
      the keyboard.





                  1.4.9  ERASE TO END OF FIELD

           The function   clears the   rest of   the field,   including the
      current cursor position,  if the cursor  is in an  unprotected field.
      The  operation can  wrap lines  or the  screen. The  cursor  does not
      move.  The MDT bit is set.  If the cursor is located in  an attribute
      character location or is within  a protected data field, an  input is
      not accepted.

           This  function  is handled   locally  by the  terminal  and  CMT
      updates its internal screen buffer.





                  1.4.10  ERASE ALL INPUT

           This  function  clears  all  unprotected  fields  to  nulls, and
      repositions the cursor to the first unprotected.  With only protected
      data fields,  no character  locations are cleared  and the  cursor is
      repositioned to  character location  0.  If  the display  contains no
      field,  the entire  buffer  is cleared  to  nulls and  the  cursor is
      repositioned to location 0.

                  1.4.11  NEW LINE

           The  function   moves  the  cursor  to   the   first unprotected
      posion  the  next line.   The cursor  may  wrap the  screen.  If
      there are  no unprotected  fields  on the  screen,  the  cursor  will
      move to character position 0;  if there are no formatted  fields, the
      cursor will be positioned at the first character on the next line.

           This function  is handled  locally by the  terminal and  the CMT
      updates its current cursor position in the internal screen buffer.

           The function clears the  screen and redisplays  its  contents as
      seen by  CMT.  The cursor stays at the same position.  If  the screen
      is unformatted  the cursor  is moved  to the   first position  on the
      screen.

           This  function is  not  supported locally.  It can   be  invoked
      by entering a control sequence from the keyboard.





                  1.4.13  HOME CURSOR

           The function moves  the  cursor to  the beginning of   the first
      unprotected  field   on the   screen.   If the   cursor   is  already
      there, nothing happens.

           This  function  is handled   locally  by the  terminal  and  CMT

                  1.4.14  INSERT MODE

           The  function   causes   CMT   to   enter   insert   mode.  Each
      character   typed  in   this  mode   is  inserted   at   the  current
      cursor position; data  from  that position to  the  end of  the field
      is  shifted  right  one  position, and  the  cursor  moves  right one
      position. The fields may  wrap a line if  the field is more  than one
      line.

           This  function  is handled   locally  by the  terminal  and  CMT

                  1.4.22  STATUS LINE SELECTION

           CMT has  a status  line  which performs a  similar  function  to
      the 3270 status line.

           This function  allows  the user  to  enter the  status  display,
      exit the status display, or select the status display area.

           The  CMT  status  line  (in  Full-Duplex  mode)  indicates   the
      following conditions :

       *  1. Host interface type. (BSC/SNA/X.25)
                 
       *  2. Session type. (APPL/SYS/?)

       *  3. CRT luname. (CRT: crt lu string)

       *  4. PRT luname. (PRT: prt lu string)

       *  5. Printer busy. (WAIT)

       *  6. Unavailable function was requested. (-F)

          7. Insert mode. (ISRT)

          8. Protected field. (PROT)

          9. Numeric lock. (NULK)

         10. Keyboard lock. (LOCK)



           In  Full-Duplex mode   operation, all  the above   status  items
      are  displayed  by  the   CMT   status  line.  In   Half-Duplex  mode
      operation,  some  of them  are  displayed locally   by  the terminal,
      therefore, it  need not be  displayed  again by  CMT status  line  in
      order  to avoid  the remote delay.

           * In Half-Duplex  mode, only status items  1 - 6  are  displayed
      on the CMT status  line, other status items  depend on  the  terminal
      local status line.

           * The  status line should  always be set  to ON in  the TYMNET78
      tymfile.   TYMNET78 will  use line  25 as  the only  area  for status
      display.   The users  are not  allowed to  select the  status display

      area.   The  first 40 columns  is taken by  CMT to display  the above
      first 6 status items and the rest 40 columns is left for  the Softerm
      to  paint  its  local  terminal status  items  such  as  insert mode,
      protected field,  numeric lock, keyboard  lock or the  current cursor
      position.

      For example, 

        1. With the ADDS VIEWPOINT 60 terminal in Half-Duplex mode 
           operation :
                  
           a. Insert mode, locally displays "INSERT EOF".

           b. Cursor in a protected field, locally displays "PROTECTED".

           c. During keyboard lock, locally displays "KEYBOARD LOCK".
                    
           d. No Numeric Lock.


           In  ADDS 60  HDX, only   line   1 to   24 is   used   to display
      status.  Neither upper-corner nor 25th status line is displayed.  The
      24th is the default line.  The status line number can only be defined
      in  initial  file, but  not  in  tymfile since  it  is  terminal type
      relevent. The user can not  select the status line number  during on-
      line connection, otherwise the number will be echoed on the screen by
      the terminal  itself.  But the  user can turn  the status line  on or
      off.

           In order  to keep   the terminal screen  data  accurate,  before
      the status line is displayed, the keyboard is locked locally by  CMT.
      After the  status  line   display  is  complete,  the   keyboard   is
      unlocked.

           The  whole  status   line display  area   is  protected  on  the
      terminal screen but not in the CMT internal screen buffer.   The ADDS
      VIEWPOINT 60 termina is allowed to move the cursor into this area.

          field.  When the cursor is at the last unprotected field,
          pressing this key wraps around to the home position.

       7. Key 'SHIFT-TAB' : back tab

          Moves the cursor backward to the beginning of an unprotected
          field.  If the cursor reaches the beginning of the first
          unprotected field of the screen, presing this key wraps
          around to the home position.

       8. Key 'HOME' or 'CTRL-A' : home cursor 

          Moves the cursor to the beginning position of the display screen.

       9. Key 'RETURN' or 'CTRL-M' : enter data

          racters right to that positon in the field are shifted left
          one position. This function does wrap a line.

      11. Key 'INS C' or 'SHIFT-INS C' : toggle insert mode on/off

          Each character entered in this mode is inserted at the cursor
          position and data from that position to the end of the field
          is shifted right one position, and the cursor moves right one
          position.  The field over one line wraps a line.

          NOTE: In insert EOF mode, if users enter data right on the
                attribute that is defined for the unprotected field,
                the first character of data is discarded and the rest
                are entered from the position next to the attribute.

      12. Key 'CTRL-EOF' : erase data to end of field (EOF)
        
          Erase data of the unprotected field from the cursor position
          to the end of the field.  The field over one line wraps a line.

      13. Key 'CTRL-SHIFT-EOF' : erase data to end of page (EOP)

           TYMENT78, an emulation for the extension of half-duplex ADDS 60,
      will be running on the PC so that it can have more features  than the
      real half-duplex ADDS 60 has.

            XON/XOFF should be a default.





                  1.6.2  COLOR MONITOR

      default:

            3279 Model 2A color
            -------------------

            a black background for rows 1 to 24 with

            --- unprotected normal characters in green

            --- unprotected highlighted characters in red

            --- protected normal characters in blue

            --- protected highlighted characters in white

            --- the 25th status line in blue background with 
                white characters

            3279 Model 2A monochrome
            ------------------------

            a black background for all rows

                  1.6.3  BUFFERED SCREEN MODE

           Buffered   screen  mode   operates  by   using   BOP/FOP  (Begin
      OPtimizer/End OPtimizer) mechanism. CMT optimizer routine is  used to
      paint the  data on the  screen.  At the  beginning of  optimizer, CMT
      sends the ESC sequence  (ESC D) called BOP  string to the PC  to turn
      the screen  video off. Upon  receiving BOP string,  PC holds  the new
      screen data from the host sent  by CMT in the PC screen  buffer until
      CMT sends the  other ESC sequence (ESC  d) called FOP  string.  After
      receiving the FOP sent by CMT at the end of optimizer, PC  blasts the
      data in the screen buffer to the display screen.

                         1.8  CMT OPTIMIZER FOR THE TYMNET78


           The CMT optimizer is used to paint the data on the  screen. Here
      is the sequence for the TYMNET78 optimizer.

       1. CMT: sends a BOP string to the PC. 

          PC : turns video off and starts collecting the data sent by
               the CMT into its screen buffer.

       2. CMT: sends a lock-keyboard string immediately following the
               BOP string to the PC.

          PC : At this moment, displays the status item for the keyboard
               lock on the last 40 columnar area of the 25th line.

       3. CMT: sends a form-mode string and the updated screen data.

          PC : displays the "FORM" mode and the updated cursor position
               on the status line.

       4. CMT: sends a access-to-the-25th-line string to start painting
               the CMT status items on the first 40 columnar area of the
               25th line.

       5. CMT: completes the status line painting and then addresses the
               cursor to the designated position by sending a move-cursor
               string.

          PC : updates the cursor position on the 25th status line.

       6. CMT: sends a conversation-mode string and unlocks the keyboard.

          PC : displays the "CONV" mode on the status line.

       7. CMT: sends a FOP string to the PC.

          PC : blasts the buffered data to the screen.
