                 1.  Introduction to NAD 3


NAD version 3 runs in a UNIX environment.

Most of the facilities available in NAD version 1 are avail-
able in version 3.  Because NAD 3 operates only in line
mode, some of the commands have been modified.  A list of
exceptions and differences appears in this document.

1.1  Starting NAD

NAD may be started by entering the Unix command

     nad

This command places the user in the NAD environment.  NAD
commands may be entered after this point.

The user may choose to specify certain options on the Unix
command line.  These are described in section 1.2.

1.2  NAD Options

The user may specify options on the command line which per-
form the following functions:

1.2.1  _C_o_m_m_a_n_d__F_i_l_e__S_p_e_c_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n


     -c filename

The -c option allows the user to specify a command file.  If
a command file is specified, when the end of file is
reached, control will return to the previous level, either
CMF or UNIX.  If the option is not selected, NAD will be in
interactive mode and commands will be accepted from STDIN.
If the -c option is selected but a command file is not
specified, an error condition exists and NAD is terminated.

1.2.2  _A_d_d_r_e_s_s_i_n_g__F_o_r_m_a_t__S_p_e_c_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n


     -v filename

This option allows the user to generate 24 bit addressing
format object code for MAC-V Engines.  The default is to
generate 20 bit addressing format object code.

Nad 3.01 E.R.S.                              August 20, 1990



1.2.3  _L_i_s_t_i_n_g__F_i_l_e__S_p_e_c_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_:


     -l filename

The -l option allows the user to specify a file to contain
any listings generated by the assembler.  The -l option will
override any listing options specified in the command file
or during an interactive session.  Any assembly errors
detected will be sent to the listing file and the message
file.  If the -l option is given but a listing file is not
specified, an error condition exists and NAD is terminated.

1.2.4  _M_e_s_s_a_g_e__F_i_l_e__S_p_e_c_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n


     -m filename

The -m option allows the user to specify a file to contain
messages.  If a message file is not specified, any messages
generated will be sent to STDERR.

Messages are defined as informative notices from the assem-
bler, assembly error and warning notices, and information
displayed by directive such as REMARK and ERRCNT.

If the -m option is selected and a message file is not
specified an error condition exists and NAD is terminated.

1.2.5  __I_m_a_g_e__F_i_l_e__S_p_e_c_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n


     -o filename

The -o option allow the user to specify an image file.  This
will override any ;F or %F commands.  The image file speci-
fied by the -o option will overwrite existing files with the
same name.

It the -o option is selected and an image file is not speci-
fied an error condition exists and NAD is terminated.

1.2.6  _P_a_t_h__S_p_e_c_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n


     -p

This option allows the user to indicate that NAD is to use
the path specified by CMF to locate the NAD input files.

1.2.7  _R_e_m_o_v_a_l__o_f__W_a_r_n_i_n_g__N_o_t_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n


     -w

The -w option causes NAD to not list warning messages in the
listing file or message file. The default is to list warning
messages.

1.2.8  _R_e_m_o_v_a_l__o_f__E_r_r_o_r__N_o_t_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n


     -e

The -e option causes NAD to not list error messages in the
listing file or message file. The default is to list error
messages.

1.2.9  _C_r_o_s_s__R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e__F_i_l_e__S_p_e_c_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n

The -x option causes NAD to generate an intermediate cross
reference data file.  The syntax for specifying NAD options
on the NAD command line is:

     nad -x[slfom]  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

     Where:


          -x        is required and indicates that cross
                    reference information is to be collected

          s         specifies that source line numbers are
                    to be saved, this is a default and has
                    the side effect of turning on the _f
                    modifier

          l         specifies that listing line numbers are
                    to be saved

          f         indicates that source file names are to
                    be saved

          o         indicates that the name of the module in
                    which a symbol is used is to be saved

          m         specifies that the name of the macro in
                    which a symbol is used is to be saved

          filename  is required and indicates the name of
                    the intermediate xref file.

     The information is placed in the specified file
     _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e, which may then be processed by NADX into a
     printable format.  If _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e exists it will be
     overwritten.

     If the -x option is selected and a filename is not
     specified, then an error condition exists and NAD is
     terminated.

                  2.  NAD Command Language

2.1  Using the NAD Command Language

NAD is controlled by a series of commands.  These commands
may be contained in a command file (batch mode) or entered
directly from the screen (interactive mode).  A command file
may be started from interactive mode with a ";x" command.
Interactive mode will resume when the end of the command
file is encountered.  Interactive mode (accepting input from
standard input) may be initiated from a command file by the
CNTRL-V command.  NAD will resume accepting input from the
command file when a second CNTRL-V is encountered from the
standard input.

Once a command file is started, NAD will receive all of its
command from that file until: a %Q is encountered, an end of
file is encountered, a CNTRL-V is encountered, or an error
is detected that prevents further processing.  A %Q will
cause NAD to terminate.  An end of file will cause control
to be returned to the previous level.  The previous level
may be CMF, UNIX, the NAD interative command mode, or an
outer level command file.  A CNTRL-V will cause NAD to
accept input temporarily from standard input.  If NAD is
unable to continue because of an error, a message will be
sent to the user and NAD will terminate.

2.2  NAD Commands

NAD commands are composed of single characters of character
pairs.  Commands may be preceded by 0 to 4 arguments.  Com-
mands may be followed by parameters.

2.3  NAD Arguments

Arguments generally follow the assembler rules for symbols
and expressions, including conversion to upper-case.  Null
arguments are interpreted as zeros.  Commas are usually
interpreted as argument delimiters.  The only exception is:
if an argument string contains a blank, the argument string
is considered to be an instruction.  Any comma found in such
an argument will be considered part of the instruction.

For example:

       BETA*70/3-(1+4),,3

will be interpreted as three arguments, with the middle
argument being 0.

        STH 1,2,3

Nad 3.01 E.R.S.                              August 20, 1990



will be considered a single argument.

On some commands, arguments which were valid for NAD version
1 no longer have an influence.  Arguments specified on thses
commands are ignored.

2.4  Assembly Commands

2.4.1  _'_;_A_'__C_o_m_m_a_n_d

The ';A' command starts the assembler.  The assembler will
generate a memory image from the contents of the specified
source file.  A listing will not be generated.

The complete syntax is:

        n;A filename

The argument 'n' is optional.  This argument will be ignored
by the NAD Command Language.

The parameter 'filename' is required.  It may be a PDP/10 or
UNIX formatted path to the source file.  If a file name con-
tains the character '(' it will be interpreted as a PDP/10
file specifications and the system will locate the appropri-
ate file on the UNIX system.  Any other file name will be
interpreted as a UNIX formatted path to the source file.

In both batch and interactive mode, the file name is con-
tained on the same line as the ;A command.  It is separated
from the command by zero or more spaces or tabs.

2.4.2  _'_;_@_'__C_o_m_m_a_n_d

This is equivalent to the ';A' command.  It has the same
argument, parameter and function.

2.4.3  _'_%_A_'__C_o_m_m_a_n_d

This command has the same argument and parameter as the ';A'
command.  Its function is the same except that is causes an
assembly time listing to be generated.  The listing file
will have the same name as the source file but with a ".lst"
extension.

2.4.4  _'_%_@_'__C_o_m_m_a_n_d

This is equivalent to the '%A' command.  It has the same
argument, parameter and function.

2.5  Object File Manipulation Commands

2.5.1  _'_;_F_'__C_o_m_m_a_n_d

The ';F' command causes the creation of a new NAD Image
file.  However, nothing is  written to the file.

The complete syntax is:

        n;F filename

The argument 'n' is optional and may have a value of 0 or 1.
If n is omitted the value will be 0 by default.

A value of 1 will cause any file with the name specified in
the command line to be created or replaced with the new
Image file.  In interactive mode, if n is 0 and the file
exists, the user will be given the option of replacing the
existing file or canceling the command.  In batch mode, if n
is 0 and the file exists, NAD will be terminated and a mes-
sage sent to the user.

The parameter 'filename' is optional and contains the name
to be given to the Image file.  If the file name is omitted
the Image file will be named 'IMAGE'.  The file name is
separated from the command by zero or more spaces or tabs.
If the file name contains a '(' it will be considered a
PDP/10 file specification and the system will open an
appropriate UNIX file.  This command is overridden by the -o
option in the UNIX command line.

2.5.2  _'_%_F_'__C_o_m_m_a_n_d

The '%F' command causes an existing Image file to be opened.
The contents of the file are not modified by the command.
The complete syntax is:

        n%F filename

The argument 'n' must have a value of 0 or 1.  If 'n' is
omitted, it will default to a value of zero.

If n is zero, the file becomes write protected and will NOT
be copied into memory.  The user will have to use a ";G"
command to read in the contents. The user may copy the con-
tents of the file to memory but may not write to the file.

If n is one, the file will be copied into memory and write
enabled.  New information may then be written to the file.
New segments will be inserted in segment order.  Information
added to an existing segment will be inserted in address

order.  If the file does not exist and 'n' is 1, nothing
will be read into memory.

The parameter 'filename' is required. If the file does not
exist, a new empty file will be created.  The file name is
separated from the command by zero or more spaces or tabs.
If the file name contains a '(' it will be considered a
PDP/10 file specification and the system will open the
appropriate UNIX file.

This command is overridden by the -o option in the UNIX com-
mand line.

2.5.3  _'_;_G_'__C_o_m_m_a_n_d

The  ';G' command gets a range of memory image data from the
Image file.  This command can have anywhere from zero to
three arguments.

The complete syntax is:

        pad,vad,cnt;G

where pad specifies the physical address, vad specifies the
virtual address, and cnt specifies a count of bytes to be
written.

If there are two arguments, vad is set to the value of the
first argument.  The second argument is taken to be cnt.

If there is only one argument, it is taken to be the cnt
argument.  Vad is assumed to be zero.

The ';G' command copies cnt bytes from the Image file at
physical address pad to local memory at virtual address vad.

If no physical address is specified, cnt bytes from the
Image file at virtual address bad are copied to local memory
at virtual address bad.

With zero arguments, the ';G' command copies the entire
Image file to local memory.  The upper and lower bound of
the range read are printed.

If any part of the range requested cannot be found, the
lower and upper bound of the range actually read are
printed.

2.5.4  _'_%_G_'__C_o_m_m_a_n_d

The '%G' command causes the symbol table to be read from an
open Image file.  The complete syntax is:

        module %G

If specified, the argument module is ignored.  The entire
symbol table is read into the memory image.

2.5.5  _'_;_P_'__C_o_m_m_a_n_d

The ';P' command copies a range of memory image data to an
Image file.

The complete format is:

        pad,vad,cnt;P

The argument 'pad' is optional and specifies the physical
address. If pad is omitted the physical address will have
the same value as the argument vad.

The argument 'vad' is optional and specifies the virtual
address.  If vad is omitted the virtual address, and the
physical address, will have a value of 0.

The argument 'cnt' is optional and specifies the number of
bytes to append.  If cnt is omitted the entire local image
is copied to the Image file.

Arguments are omitted starting with the leftmost argument.
That is, if only one argument is specified it will be
assigned to cnt.

2.5.6  _'_%_P_'__C_o_m_m_a_n_d

The '%P' command causes symbol table information to be writ-
ten to an open Image file.

The complete syntax is:

        module%P

If specified, the argument module is ignored.  The entire
symbol table is written to the Image file.

2.5.7  _'_;_T_'__C_o_m_m_a_n_d

The ';T' command specifies the program start address.  This
address is saved in the Image header record and becomes the
entry point of the program.

The complete syntax is:

        pad;T

The argument pad is optional and specifies the physical
address.  If pad is omitted the physical address has the
value of zero.

If the ';T' command is not invoked, the program start
address is zero.

2.6  Listing Control Commands

Listings may also be generated by using the -l option on the
NAD command line.

2.6.1  _'_;_%_'__C_o_m_m_a_n_d

Sets the page listing dimensions.  The syntax is:

2.8  Debugger-DDT Commands

2.8.1  _'_;_C_'__C_o_m_m_a_n_d

The ';C' command builds a circuit to host _H_O_S_T with the
username _U_S_R_N_A_M and the password _P_A_S_S_W_D.

        ;C      USRNAM:HOST;PASSWD

It is possible with this command to build a circuit to a
slot, a network system host, or to a gateway.  If the target
_H_O_S_T is a slot, then the user will be prompted with a
request for a slot number.

Where

        NADDISPLY   is the child process call by the NAD to perform
                    the circuit creation and I/O
        _v_v    indicates the version number of NADDISPLY
        _r_r    indicates the reversion number of NADDISPLY
        _s_s    indicates the series number of NADDISPLY
        _m     indicates the SunOs version number

The user will supply this slot number using the ";R" com-
mand.

If the target _H_O_S_T is a network system host, then the user
will need to use the "%R" command to send commands to the
system host.  Note that until the "%R" command is ter-
minated, any output from the execution of the data sent will
not be echoed back to the user.

A gateway host can be logged into by either of the following
methods:

        ;C GATE
or
        ;C USR:GGG;


If form 1 the username GATE is "homed" to that particular
gateway, in form 2 the gateway host "GGG" is explicitly
invoked.  The user will be asked to supply a password and
should respond with a carriage return.  When the circuit to
the gateway has been built, the user will receive confirma-
tion of the interlink and a login prompt.

ie
        inter-link established from TYMNET-CUP to BUBB-NET
        network: please log in:


Once the message "please log in:" has been output, login
proceeds as though directly from a terminal.  This capabil-
ity is not explicitly built into NAD, and thus the need for
using the "::" or "%R" command. No matter which command is
used to complete the login, NAD currently will NOT mask off
the password.

An interrupt from the user anytime during the creation of a
circuit or during the use of an existing circuit will result
in the user being prompted with "Do you want to drop the
circuit? (y/n) ". If the user types a 'y', the circuit will
be zapped. If the user types a 'n', the circuit will not be
zapped. Any other response besides 'y' and 'n' will cause

The complete syntax is:

        ;Rx1x2...

Succeeding pairs of hexidecimal digits (x1x2...) are
transmitted as characters; the command is terminated when
the first non-digit is entered.  Any valid characters may be
sent this way, including those which have special properties
when typed directly.

2.8.3  _'_%_R_'__C_o_m_m_a_n_d

The '%R' command is a text-relay command.

The complete syntax is:

        %Rabc...<esc><cr>

Text typed after the %R command (abc...) is transmitted
without inspection by NAD.  The text is terminated by the
<esc><cr> sequence.

2.8.4  _'_:_:_'__C_o_m_m_a_n_d

This command transmits a string of text.

The complete syntax is:

        ::string exp-string

String consist of all characters between the :: command and
blank or carriage return.  This string is transmitted
without inspection by NAD.

Exp-string is optional and may be up to 16 expressions
separated by commas.  The expressions are evaluated follow-
ing NAD expression evaluation rules before transmission.

If exp-string is not present, the string should be followed
immediately by a carriage return, with no intervening
blanks.

2.9  DDT commands

Most of the DDT commands implemented in NAD version 1 and
ISIS are implemented in NAD version 2.  The normal syntax
consists the following two forms:

  1.  A command character followed by an argument string
      which has N arguments and N delimiters ( N-1 commas,
      blanks, or tabs and a concluding carriage return.)

  2.  An argument string which has N arguments followed by a
      command character.  Commas are the only legal argument
      delimiters. This command is terminated by a carriage
      return, and contains no intervening blanks.

The arguments can be complex expressions involving symbols
defined during the assembly.

2.9.1  _'_:_A_'__C_o_m_m_a_n_d

2.9.15  _'_:_S_S_'__C_o_m_m_a_n_d

Alternate save memory on disk

The complete syntax is:

        :SS unit sector core-addr number-of bytes

Copies  the number of bytes specified from core-addr to the
unit and sector specified.

This command is only valid if the system includes a disk and
SUP, and the global unit definition includes the "SS" attri-
bute.

2.9.16  _'_:_T_'__C_o_m_m_a_n_d

2.9.21  _'_:_X_'__C_o_m_m_a_n_d

Search for data.

The complete syntax is:

        :X match bytes value

Match may be either 0 (for match) or 1 (for non-match).
Bytes may be either 1,2 or 4 and indicates the number of
bytes.  Value is one word.

The search range set by the ':M' command is used with the
mask set in  the
 ':M' command.  The mask is ANDed with the memory value and
compared to value.  In a match (0) search the address of the
matched cells are printed.  In a non-mask (1) search the
addresses and values of  non-matching cells are printed.

2.9.22  _'_:_Y_'__C_o_m_m_a_n_d

Search for instruction.

2.9.23  _'_:_Z_'__C_o_m_m_a_n_d

The ':Z' (zap) command start the log off sequence.  "Logging
off?" is displayed to confirm the user's intentions.  The
user must  enter ":Z" to log off, anything else will abort
the log off.

2.9.24  _'_:_B_a_c_k_s_l_a_s_h_'__C_o_m_m_a_n_d

The :\ command restarts DDT.  This process causes an exami-
nation of diagnostics to determine if any abnormal condi-
tions have occurred since the last start.  These include:
parity error, illegal memory reference, illegal SVC's, or
KERNEL crashes.

2.10  Miscellaneous Commands

2.10.1  _'_^_V_'__C_o_m_m_a_n_d

The '^V' command causes the input processor to accept input
from the standard input until a second '^V' is encountered.
Control-V on UNIX is an escape character for control charac-
ters.  Therefore, in order to get a CNTRL-V as input to NAD,
the user must type CNTRL-V twice.

Given the following command file:

        ;A      fileA
        LAB     EQ      ^V ;;comment
        ;A      fileB

If the user was to enter the following when the CNTRL-V in
the command file was encountered:

        44
        LAB2    EQ      22^V


Then the session would echo to the screen as follows:

        ;A      fileA
        LAB     EQ      44
        LAB2    EQ      22 ^V
        ;;comment
        ;A      fileB

The CNTRL-V and carriage return will show up on the terminal
screen but not in the message file. This is because the
CNTRL-V and carriage return which are entered in interactive

mode are discarded and the rest of the original line from
the command file, in this case " ;; comment", is put in the
input buffer in place of the CNTRL-V and carriage return.
The same session would look like the following in a message
file:

        ;A      fileA
        LAB     EQ      44
        LAB2    EQ      22  ;;comment
        ;A      fileB


2.10.2  _'_;_X_'__C_o_m_m_a_n_d

The ';X' command causes the command interpreter to accept
input from a command file.

The complete syntax is:

        ;X filename

Filename is a required parameter and specifies the NAD com-
mand file.  If the file name contains the character'(' it
will be interpreted as a PDP/10 file specification and the
system will locate the appropriate file on the UNIX system.
Any other file name will be interpreted as a UNIX formatted
path to the command file.

The file name is contained on the same line as the ;X com-
mand and is separated from the command by zero or more
spaces or tabs.

An end of file will cause control to return to the previous
level. The previous level may be the NAD interactive mode,
or an outer level command file.

2.10.3  _'_;_;_'__C_o_m_m_a_n_d_

The ';;' command causes the remainder of the command line to
be ignored.  It is used to place comments in the command
file.

2.10.4  _'_%_Q_'__C_o_m_m_a_n_d

The '%Q' command causes the NAD command processor to exit.
Control is returned  either the CMF system, or the UNIX
Shell environment.

2.10.5  _<_e_s_c_>_<_e_s_c_>__C_o_m_m_a_n_d

The sequence <esc><esc><cr> causes NAD to exit.

2.10.6  _I_n_t_e_r_r_u_p_t_s

Interrupts can be used to halt the execution of a command
file and reset Nad to accept interactive input, or to drop a
circuit, or abort an interactive command.

If a circuit exists at the time the user issues an inter-
rupt, Nad will prompt with "Do you want to zap the circuit?
(y/n) ". If the user types a 'y', the circuit will be
zapped.  If the user types an 'n', the circuit will not be
zapped.

After checking for a circuit, Nad will prompt with "Do you
wish to interrupt? (y/n) ".  If the user types a 'y' and Nad
is not recieving input from the standard input (stdin), then
the input file stacks will be cleared and Nad will be reset
to begin accepting input from the standard input (stdin). If
the user is already in interactive mode, then nothing will
be done to the input file structures.  In either case, the
current command will be skipped.  If the user types a 'n',
Nad will return to processing the current command.

Upon completion of the interrupt processing, if Nad is set
to accept input from stdin, then the message "Entering
Interactive Mode" will be printed to standard output (the
terminal screen).

Any other response besides 'y' and 'n' to the above prompts
will cause them to repeat.

NOTE:  If Nad is generated as a background process from a
shell script, the interrupt handling will be automatically
disabled.

          3.  Exceptions and Differences in NAD 3


NAD 3 differs from NAD in the following ways:

  1.  Control-W is not available.

  2.  The LF command has been replaced by ~.

  3.  NAD 2 accepts screen input in line mode, rather than
      character mode.  The carriage return must be pressed
      before any scanning of the NAD 2 command starts.

  4.  In traditional UNIX fashion, NAD 3 allows the user to
      specify options which override commands in the NAD 3
      command file.  Options which are available are -c com-
      mand file, -l listing file, -o object (image) file, -x
      cross-reference file.

  5.  NAD 3 produces only a pass 1 listing.  Object code
      printed on the listing will not have forward refer-
      ences resolved.

  6.  NAD 3 will accept UNIX formatted file names.  If PDP-
      10 formatted file names are used, then either the CMF
      facility for locating the source files must also be
      used, or the directory ntdlib must be set up.

  7.  A carriage return should not be entered between com-
      mands and their associated file names.  NAD 3 does not
      prompt for file name on assembly and object file mani-
      pulation commands.

  8.  NAD 3 reads and writes complete symbol tables only.
      Any module specified with the %G or %P command will be
      ignored.

  9.  The '?' command is not available.  To cancel a command
      enter control-X before the return key is depressed.

 10.  NAD 3 error messages contain source and listing line
      numbers.

 11.  NAD 3 cross-references may contain source or listing
      line numbers.  They may also contain both source and
      listing line numbers.

 12.  NAD 3 supports a new command option -v which allows
      use to generate 24-bit addressing format object code
      for the MAC-V Engines.

      list of the value it assigns for different target
      machines.

                    tered a QUIT directive in the user's
                    source file which contains an argument
                    whose value is less than or equal to
                    zero.  The assembly is aborted under

                          5.  NADX

NADX is the NAD cross reference formatting program.  It
accepts as input the cross reference data file produced by
NAD when using the -x option.  NADX produces an output file
which may be viewed on the screen or printed.

5.1  NADX Command

The syntax of the nadx command is:

     nadx [-e exclusion_file] [-i]  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

Where:


-e   specifies a file which contains a list of symbols which
     will be excluded from the formatted cross reference
     listing.

-i   specifies that the formatted cross reference listing
     will be 132 characters wide instead of the default 84.
