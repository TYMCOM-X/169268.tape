        OVERVIEW                                                  July 13, 1987





   1 -  OVERVIEW


        XRAY  is  an  interactive  monitoring  and  debugging  system that
             resides  in  TYMNET-II  Node  Code.   This  document reflects
             corrections and enhancements made to XRAY in version 6 of the
             node   code.     (Version   5    XRAY   is    documented   in
             (DNDSPEC:39)XRAY05.DOC).

        XRAY has evolved in response to the need for easily accessible and
             usable tools for monitoring  the status of nodes in  a TYMNET
             network.  Its features are designed to give access to as much
             useful information  as possible,  displayed in  a convenient,
             understandable form.

        XRAY provides a real-time  window into a TYMNET-II  node.  Through
             it,  the user  can conveniently  display information  about a
             node's   configuration,  performance,   and   history.   XRAY
             supplements  rather than  supplants  other network-monitoring
             systems such  as PROBE  and TMCS.   Used in  conjunction with
             them,  it can  be a  powerful tool  for  monitoring activity,
             measuring performance,  and diagnosing  problems at  both the
             node and network levels.



   1.1  XRAY Features


        LOCAL AND  REMOTE XRAY.   XRAY runs  both as  a node  code process
             which can be  accessed remotely on any  node which is  up and
             running in  the network, and  as an independent  system which
             can  be  accessed  through   the  TTY  port  of   the  Engine
             Multifunction  Card even  if the  node code  is  not running.
             Several users may be logged into remote XRAY on a node at the
             same time; the maximum  number of simultaneous logins  may be
             set via the Tymfile  parameter NXUBLK (default is  3; maximum
             is 15d).   Local (TTY) XRAY  can support only  one user  at a
             time.  On an ISIS node, local XRAY is the slot 0 DDT job, and
             is accessed via the DDT '?STAT' command.

        SOLO AND ISIS  XRAY.  There are  important differences in  the way
             the  node   code  functions   under  ISIS   and  in   a  SOLO
             configuration, and these differences affect  XRAY indirectly.
             In  general,  XRAY   commands  and  features   which  involve
             accessing un-MAC'd  memory in  a node  are available  only in
             SOLO  configurations.  There  are a  few XRAY  commands which
             apply  only  to ISIS  nodes.   However, the  most  useful and
             commonly used XRAY commands are identical in the two types of


        XRAY52.DOC                 XRAY User's Guide                          1
        OVERVIEW                                                  July 13, 1987


             configurations.   (Exceptions   are  noted  in   the  command
             descriptions below.)

        XRAY CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS.  XRAY configuration parameters have
             been defaulted to provide the most suitable configuration for
             general network deployment.  However, some situations require
             Tymfile parameters which allow for selective configuration of
             XRAY.  These include:

   :       * MEANS PARAMETER IS SET TO DEFAULT VALUE

   :       XRAY CONFIGURATION
   NXUBLK  EQ      3       :*Number of remote XRAY users
   XRSZLV  EQ      3       : XRAY Size Level
                           : Level=1, ND,NS,KD,DC,PQ commands only
                           : Level=2, add Crypto and Trace
                           :*Level=3, all commands defaulted on
   XRYTMC  EQ      0       : Network Console/TMCS XRAY access
                           :*Level=0, default, Network Console XRAY off/XRAY on
                           : Level=1, Network Console XRAY on - XRAY on
                           : Level=2, Network Console XRAY on - XRAY reduced

        XRSZLV is primarily for reducing the XRAY memory  requirements for
             Gateway slots.   The default  value of  three should  be used
             whenever memory is available.

        XRYTMC is used to configure Network Console/XRAY  access.  Network
             Console/XRAY  access  is  defaulted  off.   If  level   1  is
             selected,  both  Network   Console/XRAY  and  XRAY   will  be
             configured.   Approximately  10k  of  additional   memory  is
             required.   Level 1  is primarily  for debugging  the Network
             Console/XRAY   interface.    Level   2   configures   Network
             Console/XRAY on and XRAY at a reduced level.  Level 2  is for
             deployment of Network Console XRAY.  A separate  User's Guide
             is       available       for       Network      Console/XRAY,
             (DNDSPEC:39)XRYNTC.DOC.

        Some  debugging aids,  commands such  as 'TR'  and 'TT',  the UPSW
             Trace  commands,  are  defaulted  off  and   require  Tymfile
             specification   if   they   are  to   be   included   in  the
             configuration.   OPTION(UTRC)  will  include  the  UPSW Trace
             commands.    These   commands  are   primarily   for   a  lab
             environment.  This  option should  not be  used on  4800 baud
             CONSATS.

        The On- Debugger is also  defaulted off and  requires Tymfile
             specification to be included in the  configuration.  Switches
             activating the On-Line  Debugger are discussed in  a separate
             section.

        Some  debugging  aids,  commands  such  as  TL/TN/TM,   the  Trace
             Line/Link  event  commands,  may  be  turned  off separately.

        OVERVIEW                                                  July 13, 1987


             OPTION(NTLV) will exclude  the Trace Line/Link  commands from
             the  configuration.   Unless memory  requirements  are severe
             these commands should not be disabled.

        NODE TIME  AND CLOCKS.   Time and timing  values are  expressed in
             several different ways in XRAY.

        FASTC is the highest-resolution clock maintained by the  node code
             (or, in an  ISIS node, by the  ISIS Kernel).  It  "ticks" 600
             times  a  second,   so  1  tick   of  FASTC  is   about  1.67
             milliseconds.  FASTC is  a fullword and is  usually displayed
             in  hex.  Elapsed  times are  sometimes displayed  in decimal
             milliseconds, based on FASTC.

        SLOWC is the  node code's 1-second clock.   It also is  a fullword
             cell and is usually displayed in hex.

        Node time is Greenwich Mean Time in the format  ddd:hh:mm:ss (like
             PROBE) and is synchronized  to the network Supervisor  when a
             node is taken over after a load or crash.  There is  a period
             of time between startup  (or restart) and takeover  when node
             time is the elapsed time since the code last  started running
             -- typically 'ddd' is '000'.

        RADIX CONVENTIONS.  Numeric values displayed by XRAY follow TYMNET
             radix  conventions for  such things  as node  and  async port
             numbers  (octal)  and host  numbers  (decimal).   Some values
             (e.g., channel numbers, FASTC ticks) are given in  hex.  Most
             other   values  (e.g.,   milliseconds)  are   decimal  unless
             otherwise noted in the command descriptions below.



   1.2  XRAY Security


        Access to remote XRAY  is controlled through an XRAY  goodguy list
             in each  node.  The goodguy  list is defined  by a  series of
             calls to the GG macro, as follows:

        GG(<privilege status>,0,<username>,<override status>)

        where   <privilege status> may be 0, 1 or 2 and determines whether
             the user  is able to execute certain classes of XRAY commands
             (see  PRIVILEGED COMMANDS below);

         <username>  must be  a  valid network  username of  12d  or fewer
             characters;

         <override status> is 0-FFx  and determines the user's  ability to
             log in to XRAY on a node when all XRAY slots are in  use (see
             ACCESSING XRAY below).


        XRAY52.DOC                 XRAY User's Guide                          3
        OVERVIEW                                                  July 13, 1987


        For a  SOLO configuration, the  GG macro calls  may appear  in the
             Tymfile or in a goodguy parameter file or both.  For  an ISIS
             configuration,  the  GG  macro  calls  must  be  part  of the
             standard ISIS XGG macro definition.

        There are no security restrictions on access to local XRAY.



   1.3  Accessing XRAY


        XRAY can be accessed both remotely through the network and locally
             through  the  TTY  port on  the  Engine  multi-function card.
             Local XRAY actually runs as a separate process from  the node
             code  and  can be  accessed  even  if the  node  code  is not
             running.  Thus it can  be used to trouble-shoot a  node which
             is not up in the network.

        GETTING  INTO  AND  OUT  OF REMOTE  XRAY.   XRAY  can  be accessed
             remotely on any node that  is up in the network.   Local XRAY
             can be  accessed remotely by  logging into DDT  slot 0  on an
             ISIS node (see blow).  The logon string for remote XRAY is;

           GOODGUY:<kernel host number>;<password>

           (where GOODGUY is a username on the goodguy list for this node)


        If logon is successful, XRAY responds with:

           **X-RAY** NODE: <node #>  HOST: <host #>  TIME: ddd:hh:mm:ss 


        If all XRAY ports are already  in use on the node, the  login will
             succeed only  if the  new user's  override status  is greater
             than that of  at least one of  the user's already  logged in.
             In that case, the existing XRAY user's circuit will be zapped
             with the message "xray slot overriden".

        If no  XRAY ports  are available  and none  can be  preempted, the
             login fails with the message "out of xray slots".

        Control-C is the  <escape> sequence in  remote XRAY --  it cancels
             input and interrupts output.

        To log off from remote XRAY, type control-Z.  No logoff message is
             issued.

        OVERVIEW                                                  July 13, 1987


        ACCESSING LOCAL (TTY) XRAY.  XRAY can be accessed through  the TTY
             port on the Engine multi-function card.  It is  not necessary
             that the node be up  in the network, but the machine  must be
             running  code--i.e.,  it cannot  be  halted or  in  its boot.
             Simply plug a  terminal into the  TTY port, making  sure that
             baud-rate selector on the multi-function card is set to match
             the terminal speed.

        On  a SOLO  machine, pressing  <BREAK> elicits  the NODE/HOST/TIME
             message as  above.  There  is no  way to  log off  from local
             XRAY.  Control-C cancels  input but may not  interrupt output
             (the TTY port is  a half-duplex device, so when  it's talking
             it isn't listening); use <BREAK> instead.

        On an ISIS node, local (TTY) XRAY is a DDT job; it can be accessed
             by logging into slot 0 DDT either remotely or through the TTY
             port.  Once you have logged into DDT (Slot 0), typing '?STAT'
             elicits the XRAY NODE/HOST/TIME message as  above.  Control-C
             cancels input and  <BREAK> interrupts output; in  both cases,
             control is returned to DDT so you have to type  '?STAT' again
             to get back into XRAY.

        There are  a few noticeable  differences between remote  and local
             XRAY.  Only  one user can  access local XRAY  at a  time, but
             local XRAY does not take up any remote XRAY user  slots.  You
             can't type  ahead in local  XRAY; you have  to wait  for each
             character to  be echoed before  typing the next.   (This does
             not apply to a remote login through DDT.)  Echoing  cannot be
             supressed in local XRAY nor in local or remote  XRAY accessed
             via DDT.

        If a  SOLO node is  halted (wait-bar  on) or in  its boot,  it may
             still be possible to  get into local XRAY  without restarting
             the node code.  Starting the code via the console  at address
             74x will restart local  XRAY without starting the  node code.
             (Running at address 70x starts both the node code and XRAY.)



   1.4  Using XRAY


        COMMAND SYNTAX AND USAGE.  All XRAY commands have the same syntax:

        <command> [<arg1> ... <argn>] <terminator>

        where <command> is a 1- or 2-letter mnemonic and the arguments (up
             to 8 for  some commands) are  separated by commas  or spaces.
             Some commands do not  require any arguments, others  will not
             accept  any,  and  still others  will  prompt  for additional
             arguments in their own way. Most commands are terminated by a
             carriage return or  any non-numeric character  (numeric being

        OVERVIEW                                                  July 13, 1987


             0-F hex);  a few accept  or expect  specific single-character
             terminators (see command descriptions).

        COMMAND  ERRORS.  XRAY  responds to  most input  errors  with '??'
             followed by the prompt '>'.  Some commands output  their own,
             less  cryptic,  error  messages which  are  explained  in the
             command descriptions.   A special case  of the latter  is the
             'COMMAND IN USE' message issued when more than one user tries
             to execute a command which can be used by only one user  at a
             time.

        Any  command may  be aborted  before input  is complete  by typing
             control-C.  There is no way to backspace/erase input.

        PRIVILEGED COMMANDS.   Most XRAY  commands are  non-privileged and
             can be executed by  any XRAY user.  Privileged  commands fall
             into two classes:  regular privileged commands  are available
             to  users with  a  privilege status  of  1 or  2;  and super-
             privileged  commands  are  available  only  to  users  with a
             privilege  status  of  2.   Access  to   privileged  commands
             requires entry  of a special  command and  security sequence.
             An  attempt  to  execute a  privileged  command  when  not in
             privileged  mode   elicits  the  message   'NOT  AUTHORIZED'.
             Commands  which  are  privileged  are  noted  in  the command
             descriptions below.

        NODE:   Node number (octal).

        KHOST:  Kernel host number (decimal).
       VERSION: Node code version number and configuration type (octal)
            0000vvrr = SOLO switcher
            0001vvrr = ISIS

            0003vvrr = GATEWAY 

        If  it's  a  gateway  slot, NODE  and  KHOST  will  be  defined as
             GWNODE,HNHOST,INHOST:

        GWNODE: Node number (octal).

        HNHOST: Home-net Kernel host number (decimal).

        INHOST: ISIS-net Kernel host number (decimal).  and the  last line
             banner **XRAY** will be **GATEWAY OPERATION MANAGER**.

        H-WARE/S-WARE: These fields display the currently  selected crash-
             handling   options   for  hardware   and   software  crashes,
             respectively. See the 'CO' command for an explanation  of the
             options.

        SUPR: Current Supervisor number.  If 00, the node is not under the
             control of a supervisor (i.e., it is out of the network).

        MEMORY: Available memory.  In an ISIS node, this is the  amount of
             memory allocated  to slot  0 in the  Tymfile (S0CORE).   In a
             SOLO node, it is the amount of physical memory in the machine
             as calculated  during initialization.  The  node code  may or
             may  not use  all the  available memory.   Current  node code
             cannot recognize memory in excess of 1 meg, so 1024KB  is the
             maximum possible value for this field.

        PORTS: Total number of circuits terminating on the node.  Includes
             Kernel, Dispatcher, and Async ports.

        PASSTHRUS: Number  of passthrough circuits  on the node.   PORTS +
             PASSTHRUS + INTERNAL HOST CIRCUITS + SUPERVISOR PORTS = total
             number of circuits on the node.

        ALNK: Number of active (up) links.

        TLNK: Total number of links (TII-, X-, and Star-) specified in the
             Tymfile.

        XLNK:  Number of  unassigned  (wild-card)  links specified  in the

        STXK:  Number  of  Star-Xlinks  available  to  insert  new  remote
             stations.

        LINES, SYNC, SIO,  STAR, ASYNC: Total  number of lines,  number of
             SYNC lines, number  of SIO lines,  number of Star  lines, and
             number  of  async  ports,  respectively,  specified   in  the
             Tymfile.  STAR field not present unless specified in Tymfile.
             ASYNC field not present unless Tymsat or Consat.

        NODE FIRST TIME UP: The  time the node was first taken  over after
             the last load.

        NODE LAST TIME  UP: The time the  node was first taken  over after
             the last startup.

        LAST CRASH: Crash summary information for the most recent crash.
           TIME:    Time of last crash.  (May be incorrect if the
                    node had not yet been taken over when it crashed.)
           CC:      Crash count at time of crash.
           TYPE:    Crash type (refer to Appendix II for explanation).
           PSW:     Crash PSW.
           ADDRESS: Crash address (refer to PSW to determine
                    whether mac'd or not).

        LINE NO./TYPE:  Line number and  type (SYNC, SIO  or STAR).   On a
             SOLO node, sync line numbers correspond directly  to physical
             sync ports,  and SIO  lines are  numbered beginning  with the
             last sync line number plus 1.  On an ISIS node,  line numbers
             are arbitrarily   assigned  to physical ports with  the S.REF
             and M.REF  macros.  Note that  neither line nor  link numbers
             correspond in any way to  the numbers that appear in  a PROBE
             snap of the  node.  PROBE numbers the  links in the  order in
             which they are reported up.

        NEIG: Neighbor  node number on  the line.  Occasionally,  you will
             see  an  impossible node  number  in this  field.   This will
             happen if  garbage was received  on the line  when it  was in
             reset state; needless to say, the line will not be up.

        LINK NO./TYPE: Link number (hex) and type (TIILNK, XLINK or STAR).
             Suffix  '-M'  means  multiple-line  link.   Link  numbers are
             assigned to defined (TIILNK  or STAR) neighbors in  the order
             in which they  are defined in  the Tymfile, starting  with 0.
             X-link neighbors are assigned the high range of  link numbers
             in the order in which the links came up.  An X-link  which is
             not up will not have a link number (displayed as 'FF').

        LINE STATUS: Status of the line (not the link).  Status may be:
           UP      - Attached to a link.
           *DOWN*  - Not attached to a link.  NEIG field may show the
                     last neighbor node that was up on the line.
           UNUSED  - Never up since last start-up.
           DWLOAD  - Downline load in progress.  NEIG field may show last

                     neighbor node that was up on the line.
           *SUSP*  - Suspended.  A line may be suspended for one of two 
                     reasons: 1) If multiple lines start to come up 
                     at the same time on a link, all but one of them will 
                     be suspended (for two minutes).  2) If, during reset,
                     there is no permuter table or link descriptor space,
                     or if there is a reset security key violation during
                     the last step of reset.

        LINK WSIZ: Window size (applies to link, not line), a  multiple of
             4  in the  range  4-128.  Default  is 8  (e.g.,  X-links).  A
             window-size mismatch will not prevent a link from  coming up,
             but link performance will be sluggish.  This problem tends to
             occur especially on X-links  when the neighbor node  has been
             configured with a window-size other than 8.  If nodes on both
             sides of the link are  version 6 or above, the node  with the
             larger window  size will  match its window  size down  to the
             smaller window size of its neighbor.  Crypto message  76 will
             be logged to indicate that a window size match down has taken
             place.

        @:  Lines  which are  attached to  configured satellite  links are
             flagged with '@' before the speed field.  Currently,  this is
             based on a  Tymfile parameter, and  applies to the  link, not
             the line.  None,  some, or all of  the lines attached  to the
             link may actually be using satellite facilities.

        LINE SPEED: Line speed in KBPS.

        LINK  CRQS:  Number  of  circuits  on  the  link  (not  the line).
             Channels  0  and 1  are  always  in use  on  an  active link.
             Channel   0  is   used  for   inter-node   control  messages.
             Currently, the  Security Key Exchange  and the  Circuit Trace
             message are transported on channel 0.  Channel 1  is reserved
             for future use. The Link Crqs field will always be at least 2
             for a link that is up.

        LINE TIME ATT/DET: The time the line achieved its  current STATUS.
             Every time a  line changes from  one status to  another, this
             value is updated.

        LINE ERRATE:  Error rate.   A very  approximate indication  of the
             incidence of errors on the line during the previous hour.  If
             the field is blank, the line has been essentially error-free.
             Otherwise, the field will contain from 1 (low error  rate) to
             4 (high error rate) asterisks.

        The  following conditions  will  trigger the  indicated  number of
             asterisks:

                   of at least     'n' errors      4 minute intervals

        Note:
             1)  Single errors are not reported.
             2)  Reporting thresholds for the various types of errors vary
                   with the seriousness of the error.  Thresholds are
                   noted in the PROBE Reference Manual under Node Reports
                   (Message number: 40, subtype: Line error).
             3)  Multiple errors may occur in any given 4-minute period,
                   but will not increase the number of asterisks displayed.

        Asterisks serve to draw attention to line errors.  The  CRYPTO Log
             should be  consulted to determine  what errors  are occuring.
             The "errors" covered by this indicator are those  reported to
             the PROBE log as line diagnostic error reports,  types 81-8B,
             corresponding  to   CRYPTO  messages  41-4B.    They  include
             retransmissions sent  and received (which  may or may  not be
             due to actual line errors) as well as "real" line errors such
             as checksum errors and bad BORI's.

        TIILNK NEIGHBORS DOWN:  List of defined (TIILNK) neighbors not up;
             if none, displays 'ZIP'.

        NS - Display Node Statistics

        NSZ - Reset Node Statistics Peak Fields

        NS displays 1-second averages and peak values of certain operating
             parameters which are useful in estimating node load.

        NSZ is a variation on NS that clears the high-  and low-water-mark
             fields before displaying.   Fields which are cleared  by this
             command are indicated in the field descriptions below.

        All values are decimal; time values are in milliseconds.  Averages
             are per second during the last complete  1-minute measurement
             interval.   High-  and  low-water-marks  are  initialized  at
             startup and by the NSZ command.

        EXCT: Average number of EXEC loop iterations per second.   As with
             all statistics  available through XRAY,  this is  the average
             per second value over a one-minute interval.  In general, the
             number of EXEC loop counts (per second) will give  an overall
             indication of the activity of the Node Code.  The higher this
             is, the less work the node code is doing.  However, it is not
             a hard and fast rule that if the EXCT is low, e.g.  less than
             40, the node is overloaded.  If this value takes  a momentary
             dip, but does not  stay at a low  value (less than 10)  for a
             sustained period of time, there is no cause for alarm.

        In an ISIS node, the EXCT reflects the execution of the background
             processes of the node code slot;  this does not represent the
             activity of the entire machine.

        EXLW:  The  lowest  EXCT  value  computed  since  startup  or NSZ.
             Immediately  after  an  'NSZ'  command  this  field  displays
             '9999'.  Indicates the most heavily loaded  1-minute interval
             for the node.

        EXHW: The highest EXCT value computed since startup or NSZ.

        EDHW: The longest time the node code was dismissed to the  ISIS or
             SOLO kernel since startup or the last NSZ command.   Always 0
             if there  is no ISIS  or SOLO kernel.   Note:  a  SOLO kernel
             exists only in a standalone supervisor configuration.

        EEHW:  The longest  time for  a single  EXEC loop  iteration since
             startup or the last NSZ command.

        SYHW: The longest time between SYLVER executions since  startup or
             NSZ.  SYLVER is the node process which moves input  data from
             sync and SIO lines into  the input sectors.  In an  ISIS node
             it runs in  foreground.  In a SOLO  node, it is  scheduled to
             run every 16 ms (about 60 times a second).

        NEHW: The longest time it  took the node code to process  a needle
             since  startup or  NSZ.   Indicates the  worst  case circuit-
             building delay in the node.

        NECT: Number of valid needles processed since startup or NSZ.

        MPRT:   Maximum number  of active ports (terminating  circuits) on
             the node  since startup  or NSZ.   For a  SOLO TYMSAT/CONSAT,
             this is the maximum number  of async ports active at  any one
             time.  For  an  ISIS  node,  it  is  the  maximum  number  of
             DISPATCHER and KERNEL ports in use.  On a supervisor base, it
             includes supervisor ports.

        MPAS:   Maximum  number of passthrough  circuits since  startup or
             NSZ.

        RMK XCT: Total number of  calls to RMAKE in the last  complete one
             minute  reporting  interval.   RMAKE  is  the  is  the record
             assembly subprocess.

        RMK NMK:  Number of  RMAKE calls  in which  no records  were made.
             (See the 'KS' description for an explanation of this field.)

        PACKETS: Number of packets made during the last minute.

        NODE LINKS' TOTAL LOGICAL CPS RATES: Average (CPSO, CPSI) and peak
             (HWMO, HWMI) logical character  data rates for the  node, out
             and in.

        NODE LINKS'  TOTAL PHYSICAL  CPS RATES:  Average (CPSO,  CPSI) and
             peak (HWMO, HWMI) physical character rates for the  node, out
             and in.

        ASYNC CPS RATES:   Average and peak data  rates to (out)  and from
             (in) async ports. (SOLO TYMSAT/CONSAT only)

        CODE  DELAY:   The  combined   traffic-weighed  delay   values  in
             milliseconds  from  all  the  node  links.   See  KS  for  an
             explanation of the specific link delays used.  The CODE DELAY
             reflects delays in  the software; it is  the sum over  all of
             the links of the IN QUEUE, RTEAR, and BUFFER delays  for each
             link  multiplied by  the percentage  of node  traffic passing
             over that link.  The H-WARE delay is the sum over all  of the
             links  of  the  OUT  QUEUE  and  XMIT  delays  for  each link
             multiplied  by the  percentage of  node traffic  passing over
             that  link.  It  reflects delays  caused by  window  size and
             bandwidth limitations and retransmissions.

        EFFICIENCY is the ratio  of the total node's  character throughput
             to the average  per character link  delays in FASTC  ticks in
             the  node  weighted by  the  traffic on  each  node, assuming
             maximum-size  packets,  and  scaled  to  achieve  some  finer
             resolution.  It is not a percentage.  Clearly, the higher the
             better.

        PROCESS:  The  node code consists  of a collection  of independent
             processes, each  performing a part  of the  node's functions.
             These  fields  identify  the  eleven  most   frequently  used
             processes, the  percentage of time  spent in them  during the
             previous minute, and the maximum amount of time spent in them
             since startup or the last 'NSZ' command.

           ASYNC:  Processes data to and from async ports. Scheduled to
                   run every 8 ms.  (SOLO TYMSAT/CONSAT only)
           SYLVER: Processes input data from sync and SIO lines.  Runs in
                   foreground under ISIS; scheduled to run every 16 ms in
                   SOLO node.
           QUARTER-SECOND LOGIC: Performs ball processing for async ports.
                   (SOLO TYMSAT/CONSAT only)
           HALF-SECOND LOGIC: Handles link overloads, scheduling of
                   backpressure relief, transmission of dummy records, and
                   scheduling of remote XRAY output.  Also runs async
                   hang-and-answer (SOLO TYMSAT/CONSAT only).
           SPIDER: Handles interface I/O (dispatcher, kernel, supervisor)
                   and packet-making and teardown (RMAKE/RTEAR).
                   Schedules SWITCH.
           SWITCH: Processes supervisor data, login data, internal host
                   data (XRAY, down-line load).  Completes
                   circuit-building.
           LINKER: Performs various link-level functions -- attaching and
                   detaching lines, bringing up and tearing down links,
                   and generating  diagnostic reports to the PROBE log.
           DOWN-LINE LOAD: Handles I/O of down-line load records for
                   neighbor being loaded or dumped.
           SOURCE: Handles generation of delay-measurement data (see 'DB',
                   'DL' commands).
           X-RAY:  Performs remote XRAY processing.
           ONE-SECOND LOGIC: Performs various miscellaneous functions,
                   primarily of a house-keeping nature.

        AVERAGE ASYNC  TIME, MAX,  WRAP:  The  average time  between ASYNC
             executions,  the  peak time  since  startup or  NSZ,  and the
             amount of time it takes the async ring to wrap.  WRAP time is
             a  constant which  depends  on ring-size  and  terminal speed
             supported  (BAUDR).  If  async PEAK  time exceeds  WRAP time,
             async input data may be  lost or, even worse, the  async ring
             may be thrown out of sync completely.

   2.7  CU - Display CPU Utilization


        CU <log base 2 number of seconds>

        The 'CU' command with a value causes all processes to  be measured
             for CPU utilization over  the specified period of  time.  The
             period  of  time (t)  is  the log  base  2 of  the  value (v)
             (t=2^v).   So  a value  of  5 causes  CPU  utilization  to be
             monitored for 32 seconds.

        The 'CU' command without arguments displays the previously sampled
             CPU utilization data.

        Different  enviroments and  even different  configurations  of one
             enviroment will have different processes.  Also, CPU  load is
             very  dependent  upon number  and  type of  lines,  number of
             packets  sent and  received,  and many  other  factors.  This
             command is probably most  useful when the node  is overloaded
             in order to see where the CPU time is being spent.

   3.1  KD - Display Link Descriptor


        KD <neighbor node #>

        The  'KD'  command displays  the  link descriptor  values  for the
             specified neighbor.  The link descriptor  contains everything
             the node needs to know  in order to talk to a  neighbor node.
             Some of  its fields  are unvarying  link parameters,  such as
             window  size, neighbor  node number,  and link  type.  Others
             change from second to second, reflecting the passing  of data
             to and  from the  neighbor  e.g., the  record numbers  of the
             packets most recently made and torn.  All values are hex (see
             the 'HO' and 'HD' commands to convert).

        Doing 'KD' for a  non-existent neighbor (including an  X-link that
             is not up) will elicit the error message '??'.

   SPNM : SP = The link speed status has the following format:

               X X X S S S S S
               | | | |
               | | | Link speed index:
               | | |     0 - link frozen
               | | |     The link speed is from 1 (2.4 KBPS) to 1E (72 KBPS)
               | | |     in mutiples of 2.4 (KBPS).  Speeds of 74.4+ KBPS
               | | |     give a speed index of 1F (Memory Shuffler).  If the
               | | |     computed link speed is greater than 0B (24.4 KBPS)
               | | |     then the Tymfile link speed (if specified) is
               | | |     assigned rather than the computed link speed index.
               | | |     Note: The link speed is the sum of the speeds of all
               | | |           the lines attached to that link.

               | unused
               Tymfile specified link speed
          NM = Link number.  (See 'ND' comments.)
   NCHN : Number of channels currently allocated to the link.  Will be 0
          if the link is down; otherwise some multiple of 80 hex.  This
          value changes as the link bubbles and shrinks.
   ISEC : Pointer to the initial input sector record descriptor -- i.e.,
          points to the location where data about incoming packets is
          stored.  This is constant for the life of the link.
   NRTR : Pointer to the record descriptor for the next packet to be torn.
   AMSK : A mask used to separate the acknowledgment field from the rest
          of a packet header.  Value depends on link type (and, for T-I,
          on window size).  
   OSEC : Same as ISEC, but for outbound records.
   NRMK : Pointer to the record descriptor for the next record to make.
   NRXM : Pointer to the record descriptor for the next record to
          transmit.
   LRT  : Record number of the last record torn.
   LAS  : Last acknowledgment sent -- i.e., record number of the last
          packet acknowledged.  Should always be less than (but very close
          to) LRT.
   LRM  : Record number of the last record made.
   LAR  : Last acknowledgment received -- i.e., record number of the last
          packet the node knows that the neighbor received.  The
          difference between LRM and LAR indicates how full the window is
          and should never be greater than window-size.
   NAS  : Next acknowledgment to send.  May be the same as LAS; never
          more than LRT+2.  (If the node has received more than two 
          unacknowledged records, it will send a null record simply to
          update the acknowledgement.)
   BNOD : Original neighbor number -- 0 for an X-link, same as NODE for a
          TIILNK.  Link descriptors are always there for defined
          neighbors;  they exist for an X-link only while the link is
          active.
   CHN0 : The absolute channel number of the link's relative channel 0.
          (See the 'QC' command description for the significance of this
          field.)
   B.PT : Beginning of the link's permuter table area -- i.e., offset into

   E.PT : End of the link's permuter table area -- i.e., offset into
          NIOTAB for the end of the link's permuter tables.
   ACHN : Number of active channels on the link.  At least 2 if the link

        The 'KS' command displays various performance  indicators relating
             to   throughput,   delays,   packet-making,   and   bandwidth
             utilization on a link.  Link performance statistics are based
             on 1-minute measurement intervals, and most of the  fields on
             the 'KS' screen reflect activity on the link during  the last
             completed  interval.  In  addition, there  are  several high-
             water  mark fields  which  display the  peak  values achieved
             since the last startup or last initialization.

        Up to 8 arguments (neighbor node numbers) may be entered at a time
             or the first eight links are displayed with the KSS command.

        Only one XRAY user may  execute the 'KS' command at a  time.  XRAY
             responds to  the 'KS'  command with a  'BUSY' message  if the
             command is already in use.   If this happens, try again  in a
             few seconds.

        The KS command with a neighbor number argument list followed  by Z
             clears the high water marks for the indicated links.

        All values are decimal; all time values are in milliseconds.

        CHAR/SEC PER  CIRCUIT IN/OUT: The  average logical  character rate
             per circuit, in and out.

        CIRCUITS: The number  of circuits currently  on the link  (same as
             ACHN field in 'KD' display).

        PACKET  STATISTICS:  Average  number of  packets  made  per second
             (PACKETS/SEC),  the AVERAGE  SIZE in  physical  characters of
             those packets, and the average number of logical  records per
             packet (RECORDS/PACKET).

        LINK DELAY (MS): The  average time in milliseconds that  a typical
             data  (logical)  character  spent in  each  of  the following
             stages of its passage  through the node.  The  times recorded
             are actually for packets, but the average character  delay is
             the same  as the  packet delay.   This is  because characters
             cannot pass any faster through the node than the  packet they
             are travelling in.

          IN QUEUE: Time spent, after coming in on a line, waiting to be
                    checksummed and moved to the input sector.
                    The number reported is actually the average time
                    between SYLVER executions.

             RTEAR: Time spent waiting for packet to be torn down.
                    The number reported is the average time from when
                    SYLVER has moved a complete packet into the input
                    sector until RTEAR begins to tear down the packet.

            BUFFER: Time spent in output buffer waiting to be made into
                    a packet.  Reflects delay caused by window-size
                    limitations and backpressure constraints. 
                    The number reported is the time expressed in
                    milliseconds since this packet count was last
                    zeroed out divided by number of times we've completed
                    servicing all channels on the link.  In other words,
                    it is the average time between RMK packet makes,
                    which is the average time that any character spent in
                    the buffers.

         OUT QUEUE: Time spent in output sector waiting to be transmitted.
                    This number is the average time for the interval
                    between RMK's completing a packet and SYLVEX's
                    transmitting the packet.  Delays are added into a
                    cumulative counter, and then divided by the number of
                    packets made.  The counter keeps track of additional
                    delay caused by retransmitted packets.  The statistic
                    is not kept for SIO lines.

              XMIT: The average transmission time of a packet.
                    The number reported is the average packet size per
                    link multiplied by the number of lines on the link
                    and divided by the link's character per second rate.
                    This number reflects the average delay from when a
                    character is taken from the output sector until it
                    can be acted upon by the node at the other end of 
                    the link.

             TOTAL: The sum of all the above figures.


        OVERLOAD  COUNT:  The number  of  times during  the  last 1-minute
             interval that all channels on the link with output data could
             not be serviced by RMAKE at least once every 1/2  second.  If
             this  happens  more  than  10  times  in  a  minute,  a "link
             overloaded" report is sent to the supervisor  (CRYPTO message
             36).   This condition  affects the  cost of  the link  in the
             supervisor's routing algorithm.  The link remains in overload
             state for five minutes  at which time the  supervisor assumes
             that it went un-overloaded.  The default threshold of  10 can
             be  changed in  the TYMFILE  (LKOVTH) or  can be  patched (at
             symbol LKOVCT).

        SATURATED COUNT:  A link is considered saturated during  any half-
             second interval if none of  its lines were ever idle  (had no
             packets  to transmit)  during that  interval.   If saturation
             occurs  during more  than 30  half- second  intervals  in one
             minute,  a "link  out  of bandwidth"  report is  sent  to the
             supervisor, message  number 14  subtype 94,  corresponding to
             CRYPTO message  37.  This condition  affects the cost  of the
             link in the supervisor's circuit-routing algorithm.  The link
             remains  in the  out-of-bandwidth state  for five  minutes at
             which  time  the   supervisor  assumes  that   the  condition
             terminates.  The default threshold  of 30d can be  changed in
             the TYMFILE (LKSTTH) or can be patched (at symbol LKSATC).

        BACKLOG COUNT:  The number of times in the last minute  that RMAKE
             was prevented from looking  for data to be made  into packets
             because  the output  sector was  full  (contained window-size
             packets).  This  can happen for  several reasons.   The worst
             case  is  that  communication  with  the  neighbor  is  being
             hampered in some way and packets are being retransmitted at a
             high rate.  The least worst case is that RMAKE is  running so
             often that the packet-transmitter (typically on a lower-speed
             link) is causing the bottle-neck simply because it can't send
             the  packets  out  fast enough.   A  high  backlog  count, by
             itself, is  not necessarily  indicative of  a problem  on the
             link.   The  backlog   condition  is  not  reported   to  the
             supervisor.

             interval.   This number  is used  in the  calculation  of the
             PACKETS/SEC statistic.

        IDLE CALLS: The number of times during the last  1-minute interval
             that RMAKE was  called and found no  work to do.   This value
             plus the BACKLOG COUNT is the total number of times RMAKE was
             called and did not make a frame.

         MARKING: The number of times during the last one  minute interval
             that the interrupt transmitter for the given line entered the
             state   of   outputting   marks   in   preparation   for  the
             retransmission of a frame.   This is the technique used  on a
             synchronous line to prevent the start of a frame  following a
             clobbered frame  from entering the  time window  during which
             the neighbor  is expecting the  rest of the  clobbered frame.
             On  a multiple-line  link  not every  retransmission  need be
             preceded by marking.  Not every marking need be followed by a
             retransmission.  This technique is not necessary in  the HDLC
             protocol.  An SIO line will display N/A in this field.

        REXMISSIONS: The  number of frames  transmitted on the  given line
             which  had previously  been  transmitted on  the  link.  Each
             retransmission is also logged as transmission.

        XMISSIONS: The  number of  frames transmitted  on the  given line,
             including retransmissions.

        'BG' without arguments displays  the contents of the  bad-guy list
             (as do the 'I' and 'R' variants).

        The 'I'  (include) variant  will cause the  node to  ignore resets
             from  the node  which  is included.   That is  the  effect of
             placing a node  on the bad-guy list.   Thus it won't  allow a
             link to that node to  come up, although the command  does not
             affect the status of a link that is already up.

        The 'R' variant removes the specified node from the bad-guy list.

             zapped (torn down) by  sending the neighbor a  reset pattern.
             All conditions being amenable,  the link should come  back up
             shortly  thereafter.   This  is  a  drastic  measure  that is
             occasionally necessary in order to clear up certain anomalies
             (e.g., dead-end circuits).  A link which is to be BZ'd should
             first be shut and allowed to drain as much as possible.

        If the neighbor  number specified is not  on an active  link, XRAY

        TM B - Display Trace Link Background Table (Packets Made and Torn)



        The  Trace-Line/Link-Event commands  are enabled  by  allowing the
             TLEV option in  the TYMFILE to  default to true.  Option NTLV
             allows disabling of TLEV tracing but should not  be specified
             unless memory constraints are severe (TLEV adds about  7KB of
             memory  overhead).   Except  when  tracing  is   actually  in
             progress, the execution overhead for TLEV is almost nil.

        The TLEV commands allow tracing of line input events on  both sync
             and SIO lines (foreground) and, at the link-level, tracing of
             record-making  and  tear-down  activity  (background).   This
             capability is often useful in isolating reasons for poor link
             performance, failure of  lines to attach properly,  and other
             anomalies.

        'TL  <neighbor  node  #>'  activates  link-level  tracing  for the
             specified neighbor.  (If the neighbor is not up on  an active
             link, XRAY responds with '??'.)  When tracing is enabled, two
             tables are used to maintain a history of events on  the link.
             The foreground table (see 'TM F' below) is updated  by SYLVER
             as packets are received on the line(s) attached to  the link.
             The background table (see 'TM B' below) is used by  RMAKE and
             RTEAR to keep a history of packet-making and  -teardown.  All
             table  entries  are  time-stamped  with  FASTC,   so  precise
             synchronization of events is possible.

        Tracing  will  continue on  a  link  until any  line  on  the link
             detaches or until a 'TL  0' command is issued, at  which time
             the trace  tables are  frozen.  Tracing  will not  be resumed
             until another 'TL <node #>' command is issued. This  makes it
             possible to  enable trace in  anticipation of an  event which
             will cause a link outage,  wait for the event to  occur, then
             use  the  'TM  F'  and  'TM  B'  commands  to  review  events
             immediately prior to the outage.

        'TN  <line  #>'  activates tracing  for  headers  received  on the
             specified unattached line# (decimal). Once the line  comes up
             and is  attached, line-level tracing  has no effect  for that
             line until it becomes unattached again.  Only  the foreground
             table is maintained (see 'TM F' below); the  background table
             has  no significance.  Line-level tracing  can be  turned off
             only by command ('TN FFFF') and can be used at the  same time
             as link-level tracing.

        Only one line  or link may  be traced at a  time.  If the  'TL' or
             'TN' command is issued to turn tracing on when it  is already
             active,  XRAY responds  by displaying  the line  or  link for
             which tracing is active and disregards the  command.  Tracing
             must  first  be  turned  off ('TL  0'  or  'TN  FFFF') before
             proceeding.

        Note:   Both   line-  and  link-level   tracing  are   turned  off
             temporarily  when the  'TM F'  or 'TM  B' command  is issued.
             This prevents  the table data  from being updated  while they
             are being  displayed.  Tracing resumes,  however, as  soon as
             output of the display is complete.

        Here is a sample session using the trace link/line commands:

   >TL 2160                This command initiates TLEV tracing on the
                           link to neighbor 2160.  
   TRACE LINK:  02160

   >TL 2164                If tracing has been enabled for a link, it 
                           cannot be turned on for another link unless 
   TRACE LINK:  02160      it is first turned off (TL 0).

   >TL                     'TL' without an argument displays the link 
                           neighbor currently being traced (0 if none).
   TRACE LINK:  02160

   >TL 0                   'TL 0' turns off tracing.

   TRACE LINK:  00000

   >TN 14                  This command initiates tracing for valid 
                           headers on line fourteen (decimal) while 
   TRACE LINE: 0014        the line is in an unattached state. Line level
                           tracing can occur simultaneously with link
                           level tracing. 
   >TN 4                   If tracing has been enabled for a line, it 
                           cannot be turned on for another line until it
   TRACE LINE: 0014        has been turned off using the 'TN FFFF'
                           command. 
   >TN                     The 'TN' without arguments displays the line 
                           currently being traced.
   TRACE LINE: 0014

   >TN FFFF                'TN FFFF' turns off line-level tracing.

   TRACE LINE: FFFF






        The 'TM F'  and 'TM B' commands  display the trace  foreground and
             background tables, respectively.  The line-level trace ('TN')
             affects only the   foreground table; link-level  trace ('TL')
             updates both tables.  If trace is  active, 'TM F' and  'TM B'
             turn  it  off  while table  data  are  being  output; tracing
             resumes as soon as output is complete.  If link-level tracing

             is active, output of foreground and background tables may not
             be   synchronized.   Trace must  be  turned off  ('TL  0') to
             assure synchronized output of table data.  The foreground and
             background tables each have room for 64 entries.   The tables
             are circular buffers which wrap continuously until tracing is
             halted.

        'TM F' displays the trace foreground event table.  Entries are for
             events detected  by SYLVER  as data  are received  on network
             lines.

        EVENT:  Since this is such a long entry, it is  detailed following
             the rest of the arguments.

        LINE:   Line number (hex) on which the event occurred.

        HEAD:   First byte of the (potential) packet header (aka BORI). If
             the "data" received was garbage, HEAD could be anything.

             TYMNET II PACKET HEADER

             where n = packet length, and "aa" is number of frame which
             is ACK'ed.

             Packet length in bytes = 8*(n + 1).

                   3232    Downline load packet header


        ACK:   Acknowledgement field  of T-II  data packet.   This  is the
             record  number  of the  last  good packet  we  know  has been
             received and processed by  the neighbor node.  (For  all non-
             data packets, see comments on 'HEAD', above.). For line-level
             tracing this field contains  the second byte of  the received
             header.

        LINK AND LINE STATUS COMMANDS                             July 13, 1987


        RECN:   Record  number  field  of  T-II  data  packet.  This field
             uniquely identifies the record for subsequent acknowledgement
             by the  receiving node.   This field  is not  significant for
             non-data packets. For line-level tracing this  field contains
             zero.  For the  BAD ACK event,  this field contains  the last
             good acknowledgement number.

        FASTC:  Lower 3 bytes of FASTC at the time the event was recorded.
             This is  useful for determining  elapsed time  between events
             and for synchronizing  foreground and background  (see below)
             table events.

        EVENT details:

        Ten  different types  of events  may be  logged in  the foreground
             table.  A single received record (packet) may cause more than
             one entry in the table.  Usually, the RECN field can  be used
             to identify multiple entries for the same packet.

        ZERO  BIT: A  change  from marking  or  idle state  (all  1's) was
             detected,  indicating  a  possible BORI.   The  HEAD  and ACK
             fields  contain the  first two  bytes of  a  potential record
             header.  (See  the 'BO'  field comments  in the  'KD' command
             description.)  The RECN field has no significance. This event
             will occur only on sync (never SIO) lines.  The  occurence of
             two  or  more consecutive  'ZERO  BIT' events  on  a  line is
             equivalent to a  "bad BORI" line error  for all but  the last
             such event (see CRYPTO message 41).

        RESET: A reset was received on an attached line. For a  reset from
             a T-II neighbor,  the HEAD, ACK  and RECN fields  contain the
             first three bytes of the reset header and the fourth  byte is
             in the high-order byte of FASTC field.

        GOOD REC: A packet was  received with a good checksum and  a valid
             record number.  The HEAD (header), ACK (acknowledgement), and
             RECN (record number) fields are all significant.

        BAD ACK:  A packet was received whose acknowledge field was out of
             sequence with (i.e., less than) the acknowledgement  field of
             a previously received good packet.  The packet may or may not
             have a  valid checksum.   Bad acks  are considered  normal on
             multiple-line  links   with  different  line   speeds.  Their
             occurence on single-line  links is evidence of  a potentially
             serious problem  and should  be brought  to the  attention of
             support  personnel.  The  data  in the  packet  is considered
             potentially  valid, depending  on the  checksum.   The record
             number field  (RECN) contains  the last  good acknowledgement
             number received (to be compared with the  bad acknowledgement
             number is the ACK field).

        BAD RECN: A packet was received whose record number field  was out

             of range (greater than  expected based on the  link's window-
             size).  The packet is  discarded.  The packet may or  may not
             have had a valid checksum.  One common cause of this event is
             a window-size mismatch.

        CKSM ERR: A  packet was received  which contained a  bad checksum.
             The packet is discarded.  Such a packet may also  be reported
             as a 'BAD ACK' or 'BAD RECN'.

        REXMISSN:  A  good  packet was  received  which  had  already been
             received.  The  packet  is  discarded.   A  node  will  start
             restransmitting only when it has filled its output  window --
             that  is,  when  it  has  transmitted  window-size  number of
             packets and has not received a packet whose ACK field matches
             the RECN  field of one  of the packets  in the  window.  When
             this happens, it will start retransmitting the  oldest packet
             in the window  and will continue to  do so until a  valid new
             ACK  is received  or  until the  link goes  down  (which will
             happen in about 16 seconds).  A high rate  of retransmissions
             is usually the result  of packets' getting clobbered  by line
             errors -- the transmitting node is simply not getting the ACK
             updates.   It can  also happen  when one  node  is processing
             packets very much more  slowly (or, in the extreme  case, not
             at  all  --  i.e.,  when  it  has  crashed)  than  the other.
             Retransmission rates  (sent and  received) above  a threshold
             are reported to the  supervisor  log and to  CRYPTO (messages
             45,  46).  When  one  packet in  256  sent or  received  is a
             retransmission the reporting threshold is reached.

        DUMMYREC: Dummy record received.  A dummy record  is automatically
             transmitted on  a line  every 1/2 second  if no  data records
             have been  transmitted on  the line  in that  interval.  This
             will happen on  a multiple-line link  when all traffic  is on
             other lines of the link.

        RAW DATA: This event is used exclusively by the line-level tracing
             ('TN'  command) to  indicate data  received on  an unattached
             line.  The  HEAD and ACK  are simply the  first two  bytes of
             data (aligned on the first zero bit detected, usually a reset
             header) and the RECN contains zero.

        NAK:  Negative  acknowledgement packet  received.   This  event is
             currently designed  for TYMSTAR with  NAKCOD on. HEAD  is 50,
             ACK is 00,  and RECN is the  record which is not  received by
             the neighbor.

        AZ - Initialize Async Port Statistics

        The 'AS'  commands display  the status  of async  ports on  a Solo
             CONSAT.  Port  numbers are octal.   'AS' displays  status for
             all  ports (no  argument), one  port (one  argument),  or all
             ports  in  a  specified  range  (two  arguments,  <port#1> <=
             <port#2>).   Terminating  the  command  string  with   a  'U'
             restricts  the  display  to active  ports  only  (no carriage
             return needed).

        The 'AZ' command zeroes  out certain fields in the  status display

        BR:     'Baud Rate' index (left  digit is for input, right  is for
             output).   See Appendix III for explanation.

        CCT:    Circuit Characteristic Type in decimal.  See Appendix III.

        NL:     Number  of T-II  links in the  circuit that  most recently
             terminated on  the port.

        CHAN:   Absolute channel  number of the  other end of  the circuit
             segment   within  the  node.  This  will  usually  be  a link
             channel unless the  port is currently connected to  the login
             process or to an internal  host (e.g., XRAY or an addressable
             port host on the same CONSAT).

        LINK:   Node to which the outgoing channel is  connected.  Usually
             a  neighbor node unless the circuit is not yet complete or is
             an internal circuit (e.g., to XRAY on the node).

        TIME:    The number  of seconds  the port  has been  active.  This
             value is  meaningful only if the port is active.

        UP:     The number of times  the port has been answered  since the

   4.3  BP/QB - Busy/Query Async Port [privileged]


        BP <octal port #> <0 or 1> - Busy Port, privileged.

        QB - Query Busy Port, privileged.

        The 'BP' command allows a user to busy out a port for  the purpose
             of dealing with a defective modem.

        The 'BP' command, and the related command 'QB', change and display
             the bit  array controlling  async ports  which have  RTS held
             high so that modems which are suitably strapped will return a
             busy signal to a user dialling in to the port.

        A final argument of 1 sets the port to busy, and a  final argument
             of 0 sets the port back to unbusy.  The use of the command is
             followed by a display of a bit array of all async  ports with
             bits set for  ports which are busied  out.  The bit  array is
             shown as a  string of hex  halfwords, one halfword  per async
             group.  The  QB, or  the BP command  with no  arguments, will
             display the current state  of the bit array  without changing
             anything.

        An example of its use, on a 32 port consat:

   >BP C 1
   0008  0000
                   
   >BP 9 1
   0048  0000
                   
   >QB
   0048  0000
                   
   >BP 9 0

   4.4  HP - Hang Async Port [privileged]


        HP <port#> - Hang Port, Privileged, Audited.

        'HP' causes the specified port (octal) to be hung.  This  will zap
             any  circuit to  the  port and  reinitialize  its parameters.
             Should be used only when the port cannot be hung by resetting
             the terminal or modem  connected to it.  This command  is for
             trouble-shooting purposes and is privileged.

   5 -  CHANNEL STATUS COMMANDS




   5.1  AC - Display Active Channels


        AC  <start  channel#> <range  of  channels> -  Display  All Active
             Channel Numbers

        The  'AC'  command displays  the  channel numbers  for  all active
             channels starting at  the specified channel and  scanning for
             the specified range.  Starting channel number must be a valid
             channel  number and  scanning will  not proceed  beyond valid
             channel numbers even if range is specified to do this.

   5.2  QC - Query Channel Status


        QC <channel#> - Display Status of Channel #

        QC <channel#1> <channel#2> [U] - Display Status of Specified Range
             of [Active] Channels

        The 'QC' command displays  information about a channel,  where the
             arguments  are the  absolute  channel numbers  in  hex.  This
             command can be used with a single argument to get  the status
             of a  single channel or  can be used  to query the  status of
             channels  within a  specified  range (start  channel#  to end
             channel#).  Use of  the terminating 'U' option  displays only
             the  active  channels  within  the  specified   range.   (All
             displayed values are hex.)

        CHAN:  Absolute channel number

        LINK:   The neighbor  node on  the link  to which  the  channel is
             assigned.   If the  channel  belongs to  an  internal process
             (such as an async or dispatcher port) this will be the node's
             own number.

        SP:  The  speed or throughput  class of the  circuit built  to the
             channel  (if any).   Range is  00-03 (control-A  to control-D
             gouging).    Async  port   channels  always  show   '00';  to
             determine the speed  of circuit to an  async port, do  a 'QC'
             for the opposite channel (O-CHN).

        O-CHN:  The "opposite" channel -- i.e., the channel number  of the
             other  end  of the  circuit  within the  node  ('0000'  if no
             circuit exists).  If the channel number is less than 20 it is
             an indication of the state (login or rebuild) the  circuit is
             in.

        O-BUF:  The output buffer associated with the circuit built to the
             channel -- i.e., the buffer which is filled by data  from the
             channel ('0000' if there is no circuit.)

        CHANNEL STATUS COMMANDS                                   July 13, 1987


        S-BUF:  Source buffer -- i.e., the buffer from which data  for the
             channel comes  ('0004' if there  is no circuit).   The source
             and output  buffers are always  assigned in pairs  whose last
             nibbles are 0 and 4 or 8 and 0C, respectively.

        BB:  Buffer begin  address -- the address  in memory of  the first
             byte of data in the source buffer (S-BUF) ('00000000'  if the
             buffer is empty or there is no circuit).

        BE:  Buffer end address -- the address in memory of the  last byte
             of  data  in the  source  buffer (S-BUF)  ('00000000'  if the
             buffer is empty or there is no circuit).

        Note:  If 'BB' is zero, 'BE' should be zero, and vice versa.

        BF:  Buffer  flag --  i.e., the absolute  channel number.   If the
             channel  is  active  this  will  be  the  same  as <channel#>
             argument.

        COUNT:  Approximate number of bytes in the source  buffer (S-BUF).
             The actual byte count is within 13d of this value.

        SEC(HEX): Circuit lifetime in seconds.

        The  following fields  appear only  if REBUILD  is enabled  in the
             node.

        H-BUF:  History buffer.  In a node with rebuild enabled, a history
             buffer  is assigned  to any  circuit that  terminates  in the
             node,  i.e. at  a Kernel,  Dispatcher, Supervisor,  Async, or
             internal  host port,  or on  a link  to a  T-I  neighbor. The
             history buffer is used to retain the data that is  taken from
             the channel's output buffer (O-BUF) and made into packets.

        HSEQN:  Current history buffer  data sequence number --  i.e., the
             transmitted  data  sequence  number  (XSEQN)  of  the  oldest
             (first)byte in the history buffer.

        XSEQN:   Current transmitted  data  sequence number  --  i.e., the
             sequence number of the last byte transmitted on  the channel.
             That byte is now the last byte in the history buffer.

        VSEQN:   Current  received  data  sequence  number  --  i.e.,  the
             sequence number of the last byte received on the channel.

        REBUILD: Rebuild is 'ON' or 'OFF' for the circuit to the channel.

        CHANNEL STATUS COMMANDS                                   July 13, 1987


   5.3  TC/TD/TE/TA - Enable/Disable/Display Data Trace on Channel


        TC - Display Channels Being Traced

        TC  <channel#>  1  -  Turn On  Data  Trace  for  Specified Channel
             (privileged)

        TC  <channel#>  0 -  Turn  Off Data  Trace  for  Specified Channel
             (privileged)

        The 'TC' command, without arguments, displays the  channel numbers
             for which data  trace is currently enabled.   With arguments,
             the command turns  data tracing on  or off for  the specified
             channel.  The  argument <channel#> must  be a  valid absolute
             channel number, in hex.  There  is no limit on the  number of
             channels which can be traced simultaneously, though each must
             be entered with a separate 'TC 1' command.

        Note:   Data trace  is always  active for  the  current supervisor
             command channel (20x or 21x) unless it has been disabled ('TC
             0').   Even  if it  has  been disabled,  it  is automatically
             enabled again whenever the node is taken over.

        The data  trace facility  should be used  sparingly since  it does
             impose a small amount of processing overhead.  The  amount of
             overhead  is almost  directly proportional  to the  amount of
             data flowing on the traced channels and is little affected by
             the number of channels being traced.





        TD [<count>] [I|O]  - Display Trace  Data Table in  Hex, Excluding
             Escapes

        TE [<count>] [I|O]  - Display Trace  Data Table in  Hex, Including
             Escapes

        TA [<count>] [I|O] - Display Trace Data Table in ASCII

        These commands display the trace data from all channels  for which
             tracing  has   been  enabled.    (Unless  tracing   has  been
             explicitly disabled for the current command  circuit channel,
             these commands  will always display  the most recent  data to
             and from the supervisor.)  Both arguments are  optional.  The
             <count> argument specifies the number of trace  table entries
             to be  displayed, up  to and including  the most  recent; the
             default is all entries.  'I' or 'O' specifies that only input
             or output data are to be displayed; the default is both.

        CHANNEL STATUS COMMANDS                                   July 13, 1987


        The  'TD' command  displays the  data as  hex bytes  and  does not
             display escapes ('00' bytes).  The 'TE' command also displays
             in  hex but  it  shows all  escape bytes.   The  'TA' command
             displays   the   data  as   ASCII   characters;  non-printing
             characters  are  not  edited  and  as  a  result  may produce
             unexpected results on  terminals which interpret  certain bit
             sequences as control codes.

        Login data are edited by the processes that display the trace data
             table, and password data are never displayed by any  of these
             commands.   These  commands  can  be  especially   useful  in
             diagnosing problems which involve determining whether certain
             kinds of data are being properly passed along a circuit.

   6.1  BS - Display Bufferlet Use Statistics


        BS - Display Bufferlet Use Statistics.

        BSZ - Initialize Bufferlet Use Statistics.

        The 'BS' command displays current and historical information about
             the amount  of memory  used for buffering  data in  the node.
             This information can  be useful in estimating  optimum memory
             allocation for a node. In nodes which have the REBUILD option
             enabled,  bufferlet usage  for history  buffers will  also be
             displayed.

        The  'BSZ'  command  clears  the PEAK  USAGE  fields  in  the 'BS'
             display, as indicated below.

        BUFFERS:  Total  amount  of memory  allocated  for  buffer storage
             (bufferlets).  This  value  depends on  the  total  amount of
             memory  allocated to  the  node code  by the  NBRK  (SOLO) or
             S0CORE (ISIS) Tymfile parameters.  During assembly,  all code
             and  storage  area  (except  for  bufferlets)  are calculated
             first; whatever  is left  over up to  the limit  of allocated
             memory  is  then assigned  for  bufferlet  storage.  However,
             total  bufferlet  storage  cannot  exceed  4  segments' worth
             (256Kb decimal).

        BUFFER AND BUFFERLET COMMANDS                             July 13, 1987


        TOTAL  IN  USE:  Amount  of memory  currently  in  use  for buffer
             storage.  Because of the way bufferlets are used,  this value
             is  always  greater  than  the  number  of  data  bytes being
             buffered.

        TOTAL  PEAK:  Maximum amount  of  memory ever  in  use  for buffer
             storage since last startup or BSZ.

        HISTORY  IN USE  : Amount of memory  currently in use  for history
             buffer storage.

        HISTORY  PEAK   : Maximum amount of memory ever in use for history
             buffer storage since last startup or BSZ.

        AVAILABLE :  Total amount of  buffer storage  currently available.
             AVAILABLE = TOTAL - IN USE.

        ZAPS    : Number of buffer zaps since last startup or BSZ.

        RANGE/COUNT :  Histogram of buffer  storage usage by  buffer size.
             The node  code periodically (every  2 seconds)     checks the
             amount  of  memory  being  used  for  bufferlet   storage and
             increments  the   appropriate  histogram   "bucket".    These
             figures are cleared by the 'BSZ' command.  There are  8 equal
             size "buckets"  in the histogram  and depending on  the TOTAL
             amount of memory  allocated, one of  the 6 different  sets of
             range values is used to display this histogram.



   6.2  RB - Read Buffer [privileged]


        RB <buffer index> - Read Contents of Specified Buffer.

        The 'RB'  command displays  the entire  contents of  the specified
             buffer.  The argument <buffer#> must be a valid buffer index.
             If the buffer is empty or unused, no data is  displayed.  All
             displayed data are hex.

        This command  is intended  primarily for  reading the  contents of
             special  node code  buffers rather  than buffers  assigned to
             normal  user circuits.   The ability  to read  any  buffer is
             privileged.

   6.3  WB - Write Buffer [super-privileged]


        WB <buffer index> <data byte 1 ....data byte 7>

        The 'WB' command writes up to seven data bytes into  the specified
             buffer. The argument <buffer #> must be a valid  buffer index
             and cannot be buffer 0  or buffer 4.  These are  special node
             code buffers and do not contain normal data.

   7 -  CRASH OPTION AND HISTORY COMMANDS




   7.1  RR - Read Crash Registers


        The 'RR' command  displays the contents  of the user  register set
             (set F)  as preserved  at the  time of  the last  node crash.
             If the node has not crashed since its last load,  zeroes will
             be displayed.  (The 'DCD' command is probably more useful.)

   7.2  DC - Display Crash Tables


        DC - Display Crash Tables (Summary and Detail)

        DCS - Display Crash Summary Table

        DCD - Display Crash Detail Table

        The 'DC'  commands display all  or part of  the crash  table area.
             The Crash  Summary Table  contains entries  for the  last 16d
             node crashes of all  types.  The Crash Detail  Table contains
             expanded crash  information, but only  for crash  types other
             than power-fail and  manual-restart, and only for  the oldest
             and most  recent of  such crashes.   Certain portions  of the
             Crash  Detail Table  are displayed  only in  SOLO  nodes (see
             below).

        Note:   The 'DS'  command  [ISIS Only]  also  displays information
             about the node at the time of the crash.

        CC : Crash count at the time of the crash.

        TYPE : Crash type (see Appendix II for explanation).

        PSW  :  PSW  at  time  of crash.    This  can  be  very  useful in
             determining  what was  going on at the  time of the  crash --
             e.g., was the  MAC on,  which  register set was  active, were
             interrupts enabled, etc.

        ADDRESS : Crash  location.  If the '400'  bit of the crash  PSW is
             set, this  address is subject to relocation by the MAC.





        CRASH DETAIL TABLE : The 'DCD' command displays only  this portion
             of  the crash table area.  There may be up to two  entries --
             one  for the first crash  and one for the most  recent crash.
             Crashes  caused  by power failures  and manual  restarts  are
             not logged in the Crash Detail Table.

        TIME, CC, TYPE, PSW, ADDRESS : Same as above.

        REGISTER SET 0 : Contents of register set 0 at time of crash (SOLO
             only).

        USER REGISTER  SET : Contents  of the register  set in use  at the
             time of the  crash.  This can be determined by  examining the
             register-set-select  field of the crash PSW (xxRx).

        MAC REGISTERS  (300-35F) :  Contents of the  MAC registers  at the
             time  of  the   crash.   The  first  16d  fullwords  are  the
             segmentation   registers   for    segments   0   through   F,
             respectively.  These  are followed  by the   interrupt status
             register,  the  last  legal  fetch  address  (absolute),  the
             address of the last  memory parity error, and the  last legal
             fetch  address (relocated).  (SOLO only).  (See  Appendix II,

   7.3  CO - Display/Set Crash Options [privileged]


        CO <hhss> - Set Crash Options

        'CO'  without  an  argument  displays  the  current crash-handling
             options for  "hardware" and "software"  crashes respectively.
             The four options are RESTART, STOP, BOOT and HALT.

        With a four-digit  argument, 'CO' sets the  crash-handling options
             for hardware  and software  crashes respectively.   The first
             two digits (<hh>) specify handling for hardware  crashes, the
             second two  (<ss>) for software  crashes (see  below).  (This
             command is privileged.)

        The distinction between  "hardware" and "software"  crashes refers
             to the way in which error conditions are detected; the actual
             cause  of a  crash  may or  may  not be  congruent  with this
             distinction.   "Hardware" crashes  include all  the following
             interrupts: power-fail  or power-up, manual  restart, illegal
             instruction,  MAC  violations,  parity  error,   and  illegal
             device.   Some types  of hardware  crashes may  be  caused by
             software   bugs.   Software   crashes  result   when  serious
             consistency errors  are detected  by the  node code  -- e.g.,
             when an  attempt is  made to  get a  character from  an empty
             buffer.  Some software crashes may be the result  of hardware
             failures.  See  Appendix II for  a complete summary  of crash
             types.

        The initial crash-handling options for a node are set by  means of
             the Tymfile  OPTION macro (see  below).  The default,  if the
             OPTION macro  is not  used to  specify crash-handling,  is to
             RESTART after either kind of crash.

        The following table summarizes the four possible options:

                     'CO' Argument    OPTION
          Option     <hh> or <ss>    Parameter   Crash Action
          ------     -------------   ---------   -------------------------

                   NBTH    Node BooT on Hardware
                   NBTS    Node BooT on Software

        For  example,  the  macro OPTION(NSTS,NBTH)  in  the  Tymfile will
             cause  the node  to  stop on  software crashes,  and  boot on
             hardware crashes.

        Crash option  BOOT (02)  has different  consequences for  SOLO and
             ISIS nodes.   A SOLO  machine goes to  boot by  attempting to
             jump to absolute location 5A, which normally contains  a jump
             address  to  the boot  program  that resides  at  the  top of
             physical memory. If  the attempted jump is  unsuccessful, the
             SOLO code will  disable the update  of the watchdog  timer on
             the Multi-function card, which will cause the boot program to
             be brought in from ROM, PROVIDED that the watchdog  timer was
             armed. In most cases, the  jump to location 5A will  work, so
             the machine  will go into  boot regardless of  watchdog timer
             switch setting.

        The ISIS node code does  not have access to absolute  location 5A,
             so it cannot branch directly to the boot program. Instead, it
             immediately disables the  watchdog timer update, and  will go
             into boot ONLY if the watchdog timer was armed.

        Regardless  of the  value  of CRSTOP  generated into  the  code at
             assembly, it  can be  changed using  the command  'CO <hhss>'
             where 'hh' (hardware) and 'ss' (software) are one of the byte
             values described above.  (If either is greater than 03, it is
             treated as 03.)  For example:


   >CO

   RESTART  STOP

   means the node code will restart following a hardware crash and will
   stop following a software crash.

   >CO 0202

   >CO 0301

   8 -  CRYPTO MESSAGE COMMANDS


        The node  code maintains a  history of events  in its  CRYPTO log.
             This is a circular buffer (when it fills, it wraps  around to
             the beginning again) with room for 256d entries.   Each entry
             is  stamped with  the node  time plus  the lower  halfword of
             FASTC.  The contents of the CRYPTO messages vary depending on
             the type of message.  Appendix I contains descriptions of all
             CRYPTO messages.



   8.1  CD - Set/Reset CRYPTO Auto Display mode


        CD - Display Current Automatic Display Mode for CRYPTO Messages.

        CD [Y|N] - Turn [On|Off] Automatic Display of CRYPTO Messages.

        'CD  Y'  causes  Crypto  messages  to  be  displayed  as  they are
             generated  by  the node  code.   'CD N'  turns  off automatic
             display.   'CD'  displays  the  current  Crypto  display mode
             ('AUTO  CRYPTO ON'  or 'AUTO  CRYPTO OFF').   The  default at
             login is 'AUTO CRYPTO OFF'.

        CRYPTO  messages  are stored  in  the buffer  regardless  of auto-
             display mode and any of  the last 256 can be  retrieved using
             the 'CL' and 'CM' commands.

        CL <n>H|M - Display All CRYPTO Messages for the Last <n>  Hours or

        'CL <n>' displays  the last (most  recent) <n> CRYPTO  messages in
             time sequence, where  <n> is a hex  number between 0  and FF,
             modulo 100x. The default for  <n> is 10x (16d). If  there are
             fewer than  <n> messages in  the CRYPTO buffer,  all messages
             are displayed.  'CL FF' displays all messages in the buffer.

   8.4  SM - Enable/Disable CRYPTO Messages by Type [super-priv]

             CRYPTO Messages.

        SM - Enables all CRYPTO Message Types.

        Audited.   The  'SM'  command allows  a  super-privileged  user to
             enable (last argument = 1) or disable (last argument = 0) the
             logging of specified CRYPTO messages.  Up to 7  message types
             may be specified at once, and the command may be  repeated as
             many times as  necessary.  Also, 'SM' without  arguments will
             enable  all messages  for  possible display.   'SM'  does not
             force display of messages  that need additional flags  set in
             order to  be displayed (circuit  building, rebuild  and ASYNC
             related  messages), although  'SM' can  disable any  of these
             messages  by  message number  regardless  of  special message
             request  flags.   This  command  should  be  used  with care.
             Unlike  the 'CD'  command  which affects  only  the automatic
             display of CRYPTO messages,  the 'SM ... 0'  command prevents
             the specified messages from being entered in the log  at all.
             This  command is  intended to  be used  to  suppress messages
             which are  "flooding" the  CRYPTO log  due to  some temporary
             pathological  condition.  It  should never  be used  to "turn
             off" messages permanently.

        Class  0  CRYPTO messages  are  always displayed  and  can  not be
             disabled using the  'SM' command.  Other classes  of messages
             are normally  disabled since the  events that  these messages
             indicate are part  of the normal  course of node  code action

             classes are:

        Class 1 CRYPTO  messages:  0B and  0C - Circuit  Building messages
             These two messages may  be enabled using the 'SM'  command or
             by setting symbol  address CRYDIS equal  to 1 using  the 'WS'
             command.   Individual  messages may  be  enabled  or disabled
             using the 'SM' command.  Setting or resetting  CRYDIS enables
             or disables the whole class.

        Class  2 CRYPTO  messages:  3C  and 3D  - Async  Activity messages
             Similarly, these  messages can be  enabled or  disabled using
             the 'SM' command or ASYDIS.  (Solo CONSAT only)

        Class 3 CRYPTO messages:  11, 12, 65, 66, 67, 6A, 6B, 6E, and 6F -
             Rebuild Activity  messages These messages  can be  enabled or
             disabled using the 'SM' command or REBDIS.

        Audited.   The 'AP'  command allows  a privileged  user  to select
             (last  argument=1)  or  reset  (last  argument=0)  up   to  7

   9 -  DELAY MEASUREMENT COMMANDS


        DB [<n>] - Build Delay Measurement Circuit

        DD [<n>] - Display Delay Measurement Statistics

        DE [<n>] - Zap Delay Measurement Circuit

        The  Delay  Measurement  commands allow  the  XRAY  user  to build
             special  test circuits  from  a node  and  monitor round-trip
             delay on them.  The delay figures obtained on  these circuits
             are  the sum  of  the link  and processing  delays  along the
             circuit path.  Therefore, the network link delay  will always
             be less than that indicated by the measurements.

        The non-privileged  versions of these  commands do not  accept any
             arguments and allow only  one such circuit to be  built.  The
             privileged versions allow the user to build a number  of such
             circuits  (physical  limit is  seven)  and to  refer  to them
             individually via the  index he passes  as an argument  in the
             command line.  This argument can have any value between 0 and
             7.   The following  sections describe  the  Delay Measurement
             commands in detail.



   9.1  DB - Begin Delay Measurement


        DB - Build Delay Measurement Circuit

        The DB command builds a test circuit for measuring  the round-trip
             delay between two T-II nodes  on an all T-II path.   When the
             circuit has been built, test data are periodically sent along
             it.  The test data  consist of a halfword of  FASTC, followed
             by a user-settable number  of fill bytes (to  simulate larger
             packet sizes), followed by another halfword of FASTC.  When a
             test record returns to the node, the travel time (round-trip)
             is computed from the FASTC values, and the results are stored
             away for later display using the 'DD' command.

        The DB  command prompts the  unprivileged user for  a list  of the
             nodes through which the  test circuit will be built.   A non-
             privileged user's test circuit is assigned a default  RATE of
             3 (one packet per second) and minimum packet size  (BYTE FILL
             = 0).

        For the  privileged user,  the DB command  accepts an  index value


        XRAY52.DOC                 XRAY User's Guide                         60
        DELAY MEASUREMENT COMMANDS                                July 13, 1987


             between  0 and  7, assuming  a default  of index  zero  if no
             argument is provided.  For all indices other than  zero, XRAY
             follows the command with a series of prompts for five circuit
             parameters from  the user.  The  parameters are  PRIORITY, TP
             CLASS, BYTE FILL, RATE, and NODE LIST.

        If  the user  attempts to  build  a circuit  by an  index  that is
             already in use (by any  XRAY user on the node) XRAY  issues a
             busy message  in response  to the 'DB'  or 'DL'  command.  An
             existing test circuit must be terminated before  another test
             circuit  can be  built.  Only  the user  who issued  the 'DB'
             command to create a  test circuit may issue the  'DE' command
             to terminate it.  When a user is logged out of XRAY any delay
             measurement  or loopback  circuits created  by that  user are
             terminated.

        One final note:  After the user has  entered responses to  all the
             'DB'  parameter  prompts, XRAY  requests  that  the specified
             circuit be built.   If for any  reason the circuit  cannot be
             completed, no error message is issued to the user.   The only
             way  to  tell  whether  it worked  is  to  display  the delay
             measurement data  ('DD' command, below)  and verify  with the
             STATUS field that the circuit is active.  No notice  is given
             if an existing test circuit is zapped for any reason.

             entered for the given index.

        THROUGHPUT CLASS (0-3):  A circuit characteristic which determines
             roughly how many characters per half second can  travel along
             the circuit:

             0        20x        (32)
             1        50x        (80)
             2       100x       (256)
             3       400x      (1024)


        BYTE  FILL:   Specifies  additional  padding  in delay-measurement
             records.  The  minimum (<n>=0) record  size is 4  bytes, e.g.
             two halfwords of FASTC.  This parameter allows you to specify
             the number of  bytes of fill (4141x)  to be added as  data to
             the delay record.  The fill character is 4141(hex).  Defaults
             to the last BYTE FILL argument entered for the given index (0
             if no prior argument).

        While up to FFFF  bytes of fill may  be requested, a zero  FILL is
             most   useful  for   delay   measurement.   Delay-measurement
             circuits are subject to backpressure and requesting more fill
             characters than  the limit allowed  by throughput  class will
             not yield meaningful delay measurements.  However, requesting
             a  large number  of  fill bytes  is useful  for  generating a
             volume of data on a circuit.  Another circuit with  zero FILL
             could then be used for delay measurement.

        RATE (0-7): Determines the frequency at which test packets  are to
             be transmitted.  A table of rates is shown here:

             0     packet every 8196 milliseconds
             1     packet every 4096 milliseconds
             2     packet every 2048 milliseconds
             3     packet every 1024 milliseconds
             4     packet every  512 milliseconds
             5     packet every  256 milliseconds
             6     packet every  128 milliseconds
             7     packet every   64 milliseconds


        RATE is a global value which affects all circuits, that is to say,
             setting it for a newly created circuit changes the  value for
             all  other  currently  active  circuits  in  the  node.  RATE
             defaults to  the last RATE  value entered, or  0 if  no prior
             argument.   Every  delay  measurement  circuit   or  loopback
             circuit is given a  throughput class value of 3,  the highest
             throughput class.

        T-II NODE LIST:  A list of up  to eight T-II node  numbers through
             which the test circuit will be built.  The first node  in the
             list must be a  neighbor of the originating node,  the second
             must be a neighbor of the first, and so on.  Needless to say,

        DELAY MEASUREMENT COMMANDS                                July 13, 1987


             if any of the links in the specified chain are broken (a node
             or link is  down) the circuit will  not be completed.   It is
             possible  to build  a circuit  back and  forth to  a neighbor
             node.  If the node list  is terminated by the letter  R, XRAY
             will try to build a back and forth circuit between  the final
             node  in the  user's  list and  the home  node,  ignoring all
             arguments before  the final one.   NODE LIST defaults  to the
             last list of nodes entered (invalid if no prior entry for the
             given index).



   9.2  DD - Display Delay Measurement Statistics


        The 'DD' command displays  delay measurement data gathered  from a
             test circuit created with the 'DB' command.  It also displays
             information  about  the  status  of  the  test  circuit.  For

             bytes/packet).

        STAT : Current  status of the  test circuit. 0001  implies circuit
             up, FFFF  implies circuit zapped  due to circuit  lost (i.e.,
             link down),  FFFE implies circuit  zapped by XRAY  user ('DE'

        HWF : Number  of fill halfwords in  the test packets.   This value
             should be one-half of the value entered in BYTE FILL.

        PTR:  Pointer into the delay times storage area.  Each time a test
             packet  is  received  and  its  delay  time  calculated, this
             pointer increments by 2.  It wraps to 0 at 40 hex.

        AVE1  and  AVE2:  These  statistics  are  computed  by  a weighted
             recursion on  the samples.  AVE1  is designed to  change more
             slowly with changes in the measured delays than is  AVE2, but
             in each  case the calculated  difference depends only  on the
             latest measured delay and the previous value of  AVE1.  These
             statistics are not averages; they should display  values that
             are more  stable over  time than would  an average.   Do not,
             therefore, expect the  data in the  tables to average  out to
             these values.

        NODES: Nodes in the test circuit path.

        DATA :  The round  trip delay  times in  ms for  the last  16 test
             packets.   The entries  occur in  pairs corresponding  to the
             initial and final halfwords of FASTC.  The value in PTR shows
             the halfword offset of the latest value measured.



   9.3  DE - End Delay Measurement


        DE - Terminate delay measurement or loopback circuit.

        The 'DE' command ends  the delay measurement operation  by zapping
             the test circuit.   The value FFFE  is displayed in  the 'DD'
             response STAT field to indicate the circuit was zapped by the
             XRAY  user, either  explicitly  through the  'DE'  command or
             because  the user  logged off.   If a  test circuit  has been
             zapped  for some  other reason,  such as  a link  out  in the
             circuit path, the STAT field displays FFFF.  For example:

   >DE             (non-privileged user)

   >DE <index>     (privileged user)

   9.4  DL - Build Data Loopback Circuit [super-privileged]


        The DL command sets up  a loopback circuit between a node  and one
             or more T-II  nodes. A packet in  the format of  the standard
             delay measurement  packet is  continously looped  through the
             circuit, generating very high CPS rates which can be observed
             on the NS and KS displays. All options and  restrictions that
             apply  to the  DB command  are applicable  to the  DL command
             except  that  no  RATE  parameter  is  requested.   No  delay
             measurement is  performed for DL  circuits so the  DD command
             only shows the DL circuit status. NS and KS commands are used
             to determine the impact of the DL circuit on the node.   Only
             one DL circuit can be  in existence on the node at  any given
             time.

   9.5  PM - Measure Performance on Channel [privileged]


        PM <channel#> - Measure Performance on a Channel

        This command causes a sequence of special timing characters  to be
             inserted into the data  flow on a circuit from  the specified
             channel.   These  timing  elements  are  transparent  to  the
             circuit terminations and  have no discernible effect  on user
             throughput or response time.  The argument  <channel#> should
             be  the hex  channel number  of a  circuit  termination.  For
             example:

   >PM 20

   ROUND TRIP DELAY (MS)   TIMER : 0139    XLAX : 0137

   >

        The output of the 'PM' command is two time values in milliseconds.
             The 'TIMER' value is  the average round-trip delay  of timing
             elements which follow user  data on the circuit.   The 'XLAX'
             value is the same but for timing elements which bypass (i.e.,
             jump ahead  of) all user  data.  The difference  between them
             represents the amount of delay attributable to  processing of
             user data on the circuit.

        If  the  channel  number  specified in  the  'PM'  command  is not
             connected  to circuit,  XRAY responds  immediately  with "BAD
             CHANNEL OR TIMEOUT".   If the entire  performance measurement
             cycle (16 pairs of TIMERs and XLAXs) is not  completed within
             8 seconds, XRAY issues the same message.



   9.6  BD/BDR/BDP - Display/Set Buffer Delay Timing Method


        BD - Display or Set Buffer Delay Timing Method

        There are two  ways to measure the  buffer delay displayed  by the
             'KS' command.  The first method uses the average time between
             RMK packet makes, which  is the time any one  character spent
             in  the  buffers.  The  second  method is  to  put  a special
             character pair (Comet) into the buffer and calculate how long
             it spent in the buffer.  The default method uses Comets.

        BD - Displays current buffer timing method.

        BDR - Uses average time between RMK packet makes as timimg method.

        BDP - Uses Comets to calculate buffer delay.

        DELAY MEASUREMENT COMMANDS                                July 13, 1987


        Note:  This command requires BFLTMR EQ 1 in the tymfile.   If this
             equate is not in the tymfile then the RMK method is used.

   10.1  GP - Get Privilege


        GP <security string> - Get Privilege

        The 'GP' command allows the  XRAY user to acquire privilege  up to
             the user's privilege license as specified in the XRAY Goodguy
             list.   Please refer  to  escalation procedures  to  find the
             security string for a specific node and username.



   10.2  XG - Display/Modify XRAY Goodguy List [modify is super-priv]


        XG - Display XRAY Goodguy List, Unprivileged, Audited.

        XG  <entry  no.>  P   -  Purge  Entry  from  XRAY   Goodguy  List,
             Superprivileged, Audited

        XG  <entry  no.>   M  -  Modify   Entry  in  XRAY   Goodguy  List,
             Superprivileged, Audited

        XGI  -  Insert  Entry  into  XRAY  Goodguy  List, Superprivileged,
             Audited

        The  'XG'  command  and  it's  variants  allow  the   display  and
             modification of the XRAY Goodguy list.  The Purge  and Modify
             variants require an  existing XRAY Goodguy list  entry number
             which is shown on the XG display.  The Modify variant prompts
             for a new privilege and override license for the entry number
             specified (if  an entry exists)  and expects privilege  to be
             between 0 and 2 and  override to be 00-FF.  Any  other values
             will  be  limited  to  these  ranges.   Privilege  0  is non-
             privileged, privilege 1  is normal privilege and  privilege 2
             is  super-privilege  license.  Lower  override  users  can be
             forced out of their XRAY slot by higher override users.   The
             Insert variant prompts for a 12 character username (less than
             12  chars  can  be entered  and  terminated  with  a carriage
             return)  and for  new  privilege and  override  license.  For

        These two  commands disable  ('LE') and  enable ('RE')  echoing of
             user input  by remote XRAY.   Remote echo mode  is set  on at
             login (that is, XRAY  does the echoing of input).   There are
             some cases  (e.g., when  logged in  via an  auxiliary circuit
             from NAD)  when remote echoing  produces a  bothersome double
             echo.   The 'LE'  command inhibits  the echoing  function for
             these kinds of situations.  These commands have no  effect on
             input from the TTY port or DDT (local XRAY).

        WM - Create XRAY Warning Message

        WM0 - Erase XRAY Warning Message

        WM1 - Display XRAY Warning Message

        The 'WM' command (terminated by a <cr>) prompts the user  to enter
             a message text string of up to 64d characters.  The string is
             terminated  by a  <cr>.  The  message is  stored in  the XRAY
             warning message buffer, along with the time (GMT) the message
             was  entered.  The  message  and  time  stamp  are  displayed
             whenever anybody  subsequently logs into  remote XRAY  on the
             node.  The warning  message may be  used to alert  other XRAY
             users to special conditions or requirements that may apply to
             a node.

        The 'WM0' command  clears the warning message  buffer.  (Actually,
             the contents of the buffer remain unchanged by  this command,
             but they are no longer displayed at login.)

        The 'WM1'  command displays  the contents  of the  warning message
             buffer.

        Only one user may enter a warning message at a time.  If  there is
             a conflict,  the second  user to issue  the command  gets the
             message 'BUSY'.

        A message may be entered in the buffer only if the buffer has been
             cleared.   If  the  'WM' command  is  issued  when  an active
             message is in  the buffer, XRAY  responds with '???'  and the
             contents are displayed.

        If a message  string of more than  64d characters is  entered, the
             warning  'MESSAGE  TOO LONG  -  TYPE <CR>'  is  displayed and
             further input  is ignored until  a carriage return  is typed.
             The message buffer is cleared.

   11.1  R  - Read Memory


        R <address> [<count>] - Read memory.

        The Read command  displays <count> (default  = 10h) bytes  of data
             beginning  at <address>,  which  must be  even.  This command
             expects a virtual address.

        If the address specified is not even, the message 'ADDRESS  NOT ON
             HW OR FW BOUNDARY '  is displayed.  If the address is  not in
             the  code  address  space,  the  message  'BAD   ADDRESS'  is
             displayed.

   11.2  MA - Scan Memory [privileged]


        MA [1]<HW hex string> <start address> <end address> -

        Search memory for matching halfword string--(privileged)

        The  MAtch  command  searches  memory  for  all  occurrences  of a
             specified halfword  string between  <start address>  and <end
             address>.  If the string is preceded with a 1-bit  the search
             is for  all occurrences  of the second  byte of  the halfword
             string  which  are not  preceded  by the  first  byte.  Start
             address and end address must lie in the same segment;  if the
             user wishes  to search in  multiple segments he  must execute
             multiple searches.

        WARNING --  For node  code versions 5.03  and before  this command
             must not be  used in local XRAY  or in XRAY  accessed through
             ISIS DDT.  Such use will result in unpredictable  behavior of
             the node code, and will probably make the node crash.

   11.3  RS - Read Memory at Symbol


        RS <symbol> [<count>] - Read memory at symbol address.

        The 'RS'  command functions exactly  like the 'R'  commmand except
             that it expects a symbol  name that is defined in  the symbol
             table instead of a virtual address.

   11.4  RA - Read Absolute Memory [SOLO only]


        RA <address> [<count>] - Read absolute memory.

        The 'RA'  command functions  exactly like  the 'R'  command except
             that  it expects  an absolute  address instead  of  a virtual
             address.

   11.5  W  - Write Halfword Memory


        W  <start  address>  [<count>]  -  Write  to  memory  (at  virtual
             address),  Super-privileged, Audited.

        Write <count> hex bytes beginning at the EVEN <start  address> The
             default count is  2 bytes. XRAY  displays and opens  memory a
             halfword at a time, following which the user may enter  a hex
             half-word.  Leading zeroes are not needed (i.e., 1A  = 001A).
             Typing <CR> returns the user to command mode.  Typing /  or \
             causes XRAY to close  this halfword and open and  display the
             next upto the <count> halfword.



   11.6  WF - Write Fullword Memory [super-privileged]


        WF <start  address> [<count>] -  Write fullword to  memory, Super-
             privileged, Audited.

        This command writes a fullword. Identical to W except  that memory
             is  written a  fullword at  a time.  The default  count  is 4
             bytes.

             node is displayed.  With 1 to 8 host numbers entered followed
             by  'H', a  description is  displayed only  for  the itemized
             hosts.  If a requested host number is not present on the node
             the  request for  this item  is ignored.   With 1  to  8 slot
             numbers entered followed  by 'S', a description  is displayed
             only for hosts  on the itemized  slots.  If a  requested slot
             number is  not present or  has no host  reported for  it, the
             request for this item is ignored.  'HS', when followed by the

   13 -  DEBUGGING AIDS


        The commands  in this  section are intended  primarily for  use by
             programmers in testing and debugging the node code.  They are
             described briefly here to give XRAY users a full  overview of
             the capabilities which are available in XRAY, though  most of
             these  commands  would  rarely  be  useful  in  a  production
             environment.



   13.1  SC - Set Crash [super-privileged]


        SC <address> - Set Crash at Specified Address (super-privileged)

        This command will cause the node code to  crash (software-detected
             crash type 'FF63') if it attempts to execute at the specified
             address.   The <address>  argument  is assumed  to  be MAC'd.
             Only one crash (or breakpoint  -- see 'SB' below) may  be set
             at a time.



        SB <address> - Set Breakpoint at Address (super-privileged)

        This  command  will  cause   the  node  code  to   crash  (illegal
             instruction type  '0240') if  it attempts  to execute  at the
             specified address.  The  <address> argument is assumed  to be
             MAC'd.  Only one breakpoint (or crash -- see 'SC' above') may
             be set at a time.



   13.2  RC - Remove Crash or Breakpoint [super-privileged]


        This command  removes a  crash or breakpoint  previously set  by a
             'SC' or 'SB' command, if one has been set.

   13.3  GB - Execute from Breakpoint [SOLO Only] [super-privileged]


        This  command  removes a  breakpoint  previously set  by  the 'SB'
             command (if there  is one) and restarts  the node code  if it
             has been halted.



   13.4  ST - Set Trap [super-privileged]


        ST <address> - Set Trap (ISIS), Super-privileged.

        ST  <address>  <index>   [<count>]  -  Set  Trap   (SOLO),  Super-
             privileged.

        The 'ST' command sets a  trap at a specified address in  Segment 1
             or D.  This means that  when the code attempts to  execute at
             that  address, the  current contents  of Register  Set  F are
             printed out (along with certain other information) before the
             instruction at the address  is executed.  This is  a powerful
             tool which is ocassionally useful for diagnosing  problems in
             a production environment.

        In an ISIS node, only one trap  may be set at a time, and  it will
             "spring" only once.  The  ISIS trap is three  halfwords long,
             so care must be taken not to overlap an  instruction boundary
             to which the code might jump directly.

        In a SOLO node, up to 4 traps may be set at a time (<index> values
             0 to  3).  In addition,  it is possible  to specify  a repeat
             <count> of 1 to F (hex).  This will cause the trap to  be set
             again the specified number  of times after it is  sprung.  If
             no repeat count is specified, the trap will spring only once.
             The SOLO trap is two halfwords long, and care should be taken
             not  to overlap  an instruction  boundary to  which  the code
             might jump directly.

        NOTE: A  trap which  is set to  repeat will  not set  itself again
             after springing  until output of  the trap data  is complete.
             Thus  it  may  not  be  possible  to  trap  every consecutive
             execution of an address if it executes again before output is
             complete.

        RT - Remove Trap (ISIS format) (super-privileged)

        RT <index> - Remove Trap (SOLO format) (super-privileged)

        This  command  removes a  trap  which  has been  set  by  the 'ST'
             command, if the trap has  been set.  The SOLO version  of the
             command requires a trap index number as an argument.



   13.7  TS - Set Trace/Stop [Zitel only] [super-privileged]


        TS - Set trace/stop conditions (solo and MAC2 only) TSN  - Release
             trace/stop command

        The  TS  command enables  the  user to  specify  an  address range
             (unMAC'ed) and up to  five trace condition qualifiers  and up
             to five stop condition qualifiers which will cause the MAC to
             monitor  memory accesses  on two  levels.  At  one  level all
             occurrences of memory accesses within the specified range and
             under the trace condition qualifications will be be noted and
             the address logged in a  32 word buffer.  At the  other level
             the first memory access in the specified range and  under the
             stop condition qualifications  will cause a MAC  interrupt to
             be issued.  The Handling  routine will log the  current trace
             buffer and the pertinent information about the stop condition
             and will  schedule XRAY  to display  this information  to the
             user's screen.  Only one  trace/stop can be in effect  in the
             node  at  a given  time.   Another user,  or  the  same user,
             attempting  to  set  another  condition  will  be  denied the
             privilege  with  the  message  BUSY.   Encountering   a  stop
             condition releases the command  for another use, or  the user
             can who set  the conditions can  free the command  by issuing
             the command TSN, or by logging out of XRAY.

        NOTE--A bit of a weird  aspect of the MAC2 is that  the trace/stop
             doesn't seem to interrupt  on the very first  occurence after
             startup.   This means  that on  a freshly  booted node  it is
             necessary to set the trace/stop bit once (via TS) and then to
             reset it (via TSN).  A  workable practice is to set  it twice
             to spring on a write  to FASTC or SLOWC, which are  always at
             address 600 and 608 respectively, and in this way  insure the
             feature is in a working state.

        The address bounds  must be specified  in their unMAC'ed  form, so
             the user must be armed with S0PH, S1PH, S2PH, etc.  These may
             be added to the XRAY symbol table in the future.

        The usage of the command looks like this:

                          APPENDIX I.   CRYPTO MESSAGES



        The following abbreviations are  used to describe field  types and
             sizes within the CRYPTO messages:

                   HO - halfword octal value 
                   HD - halfword decimal
                   HH - halfword hexadecimal 
                   BD - byte decimal 
                   BH - byte hex
                   O5 - five digit octal 
                   D5 - five digits in decimal


        The following  abbreviations are  used to  describe fields  in the
             CRYPTO messages:

                   CHAN - channel number (absolute unless otherwise noted)
                   KN - link number
                   LN - line number
                   NLAT - number of lines attached (to a link)
                   NEIG - neighbor node number
                   ERR CNT - error count
                   SEQN - sequence number
                   HSEQN - history buffer sequence number


        Most Crypto messages are enabled for logging to the  Crypto buffer
             by  default.   Certain  classes  of  messages   are  normally
             disabled from logging to  the Crypto buffer since  the events
             that these messages indicate are part of the normal course of
             node  code action  and would  quickly flood  the  Crypto log.
             These  special  categories  are;  Circuit  Building messages,
             Rebuild Activity messages and Async Activity messages and are
             enabled for logging by setting the symbols CRYDIS, REBDIS and
             ASYDIS to 1 for each of the respective categories.   The XRAY
             command 'WS' is used for changing the value of a symbol or by
             equating the symbol to 1 in the Tymfile the  specific message
             category can  be enabled  at startup.   If a  certain message
             requires one of these display switches in order to  be logged
             it is indicated within the message descriptions below.

        Crypto Message 00:

        00: CRASH - TYPE= HH ,ADDRESS= HH,HH

        The node code has crashed. The cause of the crash is  indicated by
             TYPE  and  the  crash location  by  ADDRESS.   (See  the 'DC'
             command for additional information about crash data.)

        The TYPE field is a hex halfword of the form 'aats', where  't' is
             the  crash type,  's' is  a subtype  code, and  'aa' provides
             additional descriptive information in some cases.

            Crash types are as follow:

            000s - power fail/manual restart
            002s - parity error
            aa3F - unexpected interrupt
            aa4s - instruction failure
            aa5s - MAC error
            aa6s - software detected errors


        See  Appendix  II  for  a  detailed  explanation  of  crash codes,
             including the 'aa' and 's' portions of the TYPE field.

        Crypto Message 01:

        01: LINK UP   - KN= BD ,NEIG= O5

        A new  link to  the indicated neighbor  has come  up on  the node.
             This message will have been preceded by a LINE  ATTACHED (16)
             message.

        Crypto Message 02:

        02: LINK DOWN - KN= BD ,NEIG= O5

        The link to  the indicated neighbor  has gone down.   This message
             will have been  preceeded by one  or more LINE  DETACHED (04)
             messages.

        Crypto Message 03:

        03: LINK ERR (NO P.T.) - KN = BD ,NEIG= O5

        An attempt to bring up a new link has failed because there  was no
             Permuter Table space available.  When this happens,  the link
             shrink process is  scheduled immediately (instead  of waiting
             for it's periodic 4-minute  run) in an attempt to  find links
             that are ready  to be shrunk. No  new links can come  up (and
             usually  no existing  links can  bubble) until  some Permuter
             Table space  is freed  up as a  result of  a link  shrink (or
             outage).

        Crypto Message 04:

        04: LINE DETACHED - REASON= BH ,LN= BD ,NEIG= O5

        A line has been detached from  a link.  If this was the  only line
             on the  link, this message  will be followed  by a  LINK DOWN
             (02)  message.   The REASON  field  will contain  one  of the
             following codes:
           01   No good packets were received on the line during the past
                4 seconds (or the past 16 seconds if this was the only
                line on link).  Retransmitted packets do not count as
                "good", but dummy packets are "good" in this case.

           02   No good packets were received on the link to which this
                line was attached in the last 8 seconds.  In this case,
                neither retransmissions nor dummy packets count as "good".
                Dummy packets alone will keep a line up on a multiple-line
                link only as long as at least one good new (not
                retransmitted) packet is received on any other line on the
                link every 8 seconds.

           03   A reset packet was received on the line.  Whenever a node
                decides to detach a line for reason 01, 02, or 04, it does
                so by sending out reset packets on the line.  This
                initiates the process by which the line gets re-attached.

           04   The link to which the line was attached was BORI zapped.
                This can happen by command from the Supervisor or XRAY
                ('BZ' command) or as a result of a link snip (see CRYPTO
                Message 39) or other serious error on the link.

        Crypto Message 05:

        05: TAKEOVER - SUPERVISOR= BH

        The node has been taken over by the indicated Supervisor.

        Crypto Message 06:

        06: SUP STOP

        Supervisor nodes  only. Every eight  seconds the  supervisor sends
             status  to  the  node  code.  If  this  does  not  occur  the
             supervisor  is deemed  sick and  the supervisor  interface is
             frozen by the node code. All command circuits are  zapped and
             this messsage is issued.

        Crypto Message 07:

        07: SUP CRQ LOST - SUPERVISOR = BH

        The node received a  zapper (or possibly an invalid  control code)


        XRAY52.DOC                 XRAY User's Guide                         94
        CRYPTO MESSAGES                                           July 13, 1987


             on its command circuit to the current active  Supervisor.  If
             the  node  is  that Supervisor's  base  (SOLO  or  ISIS), the
             command circuit  is reestablished immediately;  otherwise the
             node remains out of the network until it is taken over again.

        Crypto Message 08:

        08: CRQ GOBBLED NEEDLE - CHAR PAIR= HH,NEIG= O5

        During the process of building a circuit segment in the  node, the
             code discovered  that the  needle had  gotten clobbered  by a
             zapper,  gobbler or  some  other 03-control  code  (CHAR PAIR
             field).  The needle had  come to the node from  the indicated
             neighbor.   If the  control code  was a  zapper,  the circuit
             segment  just dies  in  the node;  otherwise,  the incomplete
             circuit is zapped back toward the source.

        Crypto Message 09:

        09: ZAP ON UNASSIGNED CHANNEL - CHAN= HH ,NEIG= O5

        A zapper (or some 03-control  code other than a needle  point) was
             received on the channel and from the neighbor indicated.  The
             channel was  not connected  to a circuit,  so the  zapper (or
             whatever) is  ignored.  This event  is reported to  the PROBE
             log (Node Report type 2).

        Crypto Message 0A:

        0A: NO NEIGHBOR - NEIG= O5

        The node has received a pass-through needle that specifies  as its
             next destination a node that is not currently a neighbor. The
             circuit carrying the  needle is zapped. This  event typically
             occurs during the short time window between  when  a neighbor
             goes down and when the network Supervisor is informed  of the
             topology change.

        Crypto Message 0B:      Enabled by CRYDIS

        0B: CRQ BUILT - PORTS= HH,HH

        Crypto Message 0C:      Enabled by CRYDIS

        0C: CRQ ZAP - PORTS= HH,HH

        These two messages note all circuit building and teardown activity
             in  the  node  along  with  port  number  pairs  assigned  or
             released.  PORTS are the absolute channel  numbers associated
             with  the  circuit;  the  order  in  which  they  are  listed
             indicates the  direction in  which the  circuit was  built or
             zapped.

        Crypto Message 0D:

        0D: NO HOST - HOST = D5

        The node has received  a terminating needle that specifies  a host
             not currently up on  the node. This typically  occurs shortly
             after a host has gone down and before the supervisor is aware
             of it. The circuit carrying the needle is zapped.

        Crypto Message 0E:

        0E: NEEDLE ZAPPED - CHAN= HH ,NEIG= O5

        A zapper or invalid 03-XX control character pair was detected in a
             buffer that contained a needle. The circuit is zapped towards
             the destination and the needle is gobbled.  This should never
             occur and if it does contact the NODE CODE UNIT.

        Crypto Message 0F:

        0F: CRQ TIMEOUT - CHANNEL = HH

        Timeout on circuit building on an assigned channel. This occurs in
             two cases. If a channel is reserved for a T-I neighbor  and a
             needle  is  not  received  within  two  minutes,  the circuit
             building times out. During the circuit rebuilding process, if
             data is not reconciled  within two minutes of the  arrival of
             the rebuild needle at  the destination the circuit  times out
             and is zapped.

        Crypto Message 10:

        10: CHAN IN USE - LIFETIME= HH ,ABS CHAN= HH

        An attempt  was made  to connect  a new  circuit to  the indicated
             channel which was already in use.  LIFETIME is the  number of
             seconds the channel had been in use.  This can be caused by a
             number of things which should never happen.

        Crypto Message 11:      Enabled by REBDIS

        11: REB REQ - CHAN= HH ,HSEQN= HH,HH

        A  Rebuild  Request  was  sent to  the  Supervisor  because  a re-
             buildable circuit was zapped.   This can be done only  by the
             originating  node  of  a  re-buildable  circuit   or  circuit
             portion.  CHN  is the  channel number  of the  REBILD circuit
             stub; HSEQN is the history buffer sequence number.

        Crypto Message 12:      Enabled by REBDIS

        12: REB COMPLETE - CHN= HH ,HSEQN= HH,HH

        A circuit has been successfully re-built.  This message  is issued
             by the destination  node of a  re-built circuit.  CHN  is the
             former  circuit stub;  HSEQN is  the history  buffer sequence
             number.

        Crypto Message 13:

        13: BAD REBUILD INVOICE NUMBER - HH,HH

        A rebuild  needle was  received but  a circuit  stub could  not be
             located based on the invoice number in the needle.

        Crypto Message 14:

        14: REB DATA LOST - CHAN= HH

        Data was lost during a circuit rebuilding process and  the circuit
             was not rebuilt.  This will  happen if the amount of  data in
             the history buffer at either end of the circuit was less than
             the amount of data in the circuit at the time the circuit was
             zapped.

        Crypto Message 15:

        15: HOST STAT - STATUS= BH ,HOST= D5

        ISIS nodes only.  A host status message  has been received  and if
             this status has changed, a host status message is sent to the
             Supervisor.  Host status  is as  follows: 0  - answered,  1 -
             down, 2 - shut, 3 - gone.

        Crypto Message 16:

        16: LINE ATTACHED - NLAT= BD ,LN= BD ,NEIG= O5

        Line LN has been attached to the link to neighbor node  NEIG.  The
             link now has NLAT lines attached to it.

        Crypto Message 17:

        17: NO COMMAND PORTS - INVOICE = HH,HH

        A command circuit  from the Supervisor to  this node could  not be
             completed because the node was out of command  circuit ports.
             The  circuit  is  zapped back  toward  the  Supervisor.  This
             should almost never happen.

        Crypto Message 18:

        18: EARLY ZAPPER - CHAN= HH ,NEIG= O5

        On  TYMNET-1 and  TYMNET-II boundaries  only. A  T-II node  got an


        XRAY52.DOC                 XRAY User's Guide                         97
        CRYPTO MESSAGES                                           July 13, 1987


             'assign channel' command from the sup for a T-I neighbor, and
             subsequently  got  a  zapper  from  the  T-I  neighbor before
             receiving  a  needle  from  the  supervisor.  The  T-II  node
             responds by  passing on  the needle and  following it  with a
             NON-GOBBLING  ZAPPER,  so   that  the  intended   circuit  is
             completed before being zapped.

        Crypto Message 19:

        19: OUT OF CHANNELS - NEIG= O5

        The node got a needle for a circuit to a T-II neighbor  (NEIG) but
             was  unable  to send  the  needle on  because  there  were no
             available channels on the link and it was not able  to bubble
             the link.  This condition will persist until channels already
             assigned to the link are  made available or the link  is able
             to bubble.

        Crypto Message 1A:

        1A: NEEDLE POINT GARBAGE - FIRST 2 BYTES= HH

        The node  was expecting  to find  a '03'  as the  first byte  in a
             needle buffer  and found something  else.  This  should never
             happen, and if it does, the node will crash.

        Crypto Message 1B:

        1B: NO KERNEL PORTS

        ISIS and  Supervisor Base nodes  only.  A circuit  to the  ISIS or
             Supervisor  (SOLO)  Kernel host  on  this node  could  not be
             completed because no Kernel ports were available.  (On a SOLO
             split-Supervisor,  this  will  happen also  if  the  SIO Ring
             Interface is down.)

        Crypto Message 1C:

        1C: OUT OF DISPATCHER PORTS - NDP= HD ,HOST= D5

        ISIS nodes only. Attempt to build a circuit to the  specified host
             failed   because all  the node's  dispatcher  interface ports

        A packet of  length zero or greater  than 84x was received  on the
             SIO line  indicated. COUNT  is the  number of  occurrences of
             this error since the node started up. This could  indicate an
             SIO  hardware  problem.  This  message  always  accompanies a

        The software has timed out  attempting to get a response  from the
             motherboard for the indicated line.  A probable cause is that
             the  motherboard  was  not  made  aware  of  the  presence of
             daughterboard port 0,  perhaps because the  daughterboard was
             not connected at start-up time.  REASON indicates whether the

                            APPENDIX II.   CRASH CODES



        This appendix lists all crash codes as displayed in CRYPTO message
             00 and  in the 'DC'  and 'ND' displays.  The crash code  is a
             halfword hexadecimal value with the high order byte being the
             crash subtype and  the low order  byte being the  crash type.
             Node code  action after  the crash  depends on  the specified
             crash options. There are  two kinds of crashes,  hardware and
             software crashes. Hardware  crashes are caused by  the engine
             detecting  a  severe  problem  and  generating  an  interrupt
             indicative of  the error  condition. Crash  code 0042  is the
             only exception to this since it is a software  detected error
             indicative of  a hardware problem  and thus will  take action
             based  upon  the  software  crash  option  present.  Software
             crashes  are caused  by the  node code  detecting  a software
             anamoly of such severity  that the node code  cannot continue
             to  operate with  integrity. Newly  added crash  codes should
             follow sequentially to old ones  so as not to insert  a crash
             code  and bump  all  the numbers  of higher  codes  (within a
             sequential code group).

        The crash halfword  is of the form  'aats' where 't' is  the crash
             type,  's' is  the crash  subtype and  'aa' is  an additional
             descriptor field whose meaning is dependent upon the specific
             crash type and subtype.



   II-1  Hardware Crash Codes


   For a SOLO node the hardware crash codes have the following meaning;

       002x - Parity error
       0020 - Non-DMA
       0021 - DMA

              Memory location 348x contains the address of the last memory
              parity error in bits 12-30. Bit 0 is set if DMA was
              accessing memory at time of error, reset if CPU was
              accessing memory.


       aa3x - Unexpected interrupt
       aa30 - Non-microcode device
       aa31 - Microcode-controlled device
       aa3F - Interrupt from unassigned address--type of device unknown

              "aa" specifies the address of the interrupting device.

       aa4x - Instruction failure
                   aa = FE no known process in control at time of crash
                   (applies to all aa4x codes).
       aa40 - Illegal instruction
                   aa = 02 memory location bad
       aa41 - Legal illegal instruction (memory location has valid opcode)
                   aa = 02 multiple occurrence of illegal instruction
                           interrupt on legal instrucion
                   aa = 04 spurious illegal instruction in register set 0
                           (currently unimplemented)
                   aa = 06 spurious illegal instruction interrupt on
                           enhanced instruction.
       aa42 - Instruction malfunction (software detected illegal result)
              See software crash codes below for an explanation of the
              additional descriptor field 'aa' for this crash type and
              subtype.


       aa5x - MAC error
       0050 - Protection violation
       0051 - Out of bounds
       0052 - DMA time-out
       0053 - Presence error
       0054 - Write interrupt
       0055 - Fetch error
       FE5F - Mac interrupt of unknown type.

              Location 344x contains the relocated last legal fetch
              address and location 34C contains the unrelocated last legal
              fetch address in bits 12-30. Location 340x contains the MAC
              interrupt status register with the following interpretation:
              bit 24 set - DMA timeout
              bit 27 set - limit error
              bit 28 set - presence error
              bit 29 set - write protect error
              bit 30 set - write/interrupt error
              bit 31 set - fetch error

              The MAC locations can be displayed on a SOLO machine with
              the 'DC' command.
     
       
   For an ISIS node the hardware crash codes have the following meaning:


       0000 - Manual restart

       0001 - Power fail

       0002 - Parity error

                          APPENDIX III.   TERMINAL TYPES



        The following  tables describe  the 'BR' and  'CCT' fields  in the
             'AS' command,  the TID Type  for the AID  option in  the 'PV'
             command, and give the  associated terminal TID and  CPS rate.
             Each terminal is identified by its TID and CPS rate.

        The CCT Table has been extracted from the TYMNET Circuit Protocols
             document and more information about circuit  organization can
             be found there.  The TID Table has been taken from the CONSAT
             External Reference  Specification and more  information about
             PVC features can be found there.



   III-1  BR -- Baud Rate


        The 'BR' field in the 'AS' command is encoded as follows:

             B =   4800 baud
             A =   2400 baud
             5 =   1200 baud
             2 =    300 baud
             1 =    150 baud
             7 =    147 baud
             0 =    110 baud


        The left nibble  in the BR  field is the  input baud rate  and the
             right is the output baud rate. For example, a BR of  52 means
             that  the  TYMSAT/CONSAT  is  receiving  characters  from the
             terminal  at  1200  bits/sec  and  is  transmitting   at  300
             bits/sec.

   III-2  CCT -- Circuit Characteristic Type


        Each  circuit has  associated  with it  (at the  point  of circuit
             origination)  a  Circuit  Characteristic  Type  (CCT).   If a
             terminal  port,  it  may  also  have  associated  with  it  a
             Terminal-ID (TID).

           TC:  Throughput Class:   Specifies the  "Bandwidth" of  the circuit.
               Increasing value  corresponds to increased  bandwidth available:
               0 = minimum (64  characters/second max.);  3 =  maximum (limited
               to circuit paths available).
           Service Type: Specifies   the   prefered  circuit   routing:    I  =
               Interactive (route  over normal paths);   B = Batch  (route over
               Satellite paths).
            (NOTE: Throughput Class and Service Type are used by the Supervisor
               to initialize and route  the circuit for the  service requested.
               The values shown are defaults; they may be over-ridden as a part
               of the normal login-process.)
           HDX: Half-Duplex.
           *:   Auxiliary circuit is a special case;  It is not a CCT presented
               to  the  supervisor  as  a  part  of  a  normal circuit-building
               request,  rather  it is  keyed  to the  METHOD  of  building the
               circuit.   It is  thus not  valid in  a normal  request,  but is
               information made available to the destination host.
           **:  Aux Through Gateway is another special case;  It is effectively
               the complement of Auxiliary circuit.  That is, an  interface can
               request a normal circuit using this CCT;  it is presented to the
               host as an Auxiliary circuit.

   The following CCT's are defined:

   III-3  AID/NOAID


        The AID (Automatic  IDentification) option specifies that  as soon
             as a  port becomes physically  connected, the  CONSAT handles
             the  port  as  if  the  TID  prompt  had  been  sent,  and an
             appropriate character received.  Once defined as an AID port,
             the port is not available to service any terminal types other
             than the one specified.

        AID sets automatic  terminal identification.  It must  be followed
             in the option list by a TID type:

                          are supported for SIO only, and have no TID which
                          is specified by  the terminal user; the  speed is
                          set via a  switch on the SIO  card , and  the AID
                          option must be set.

        NOAID disables automatic terminal identification (default).

             of how the node code works.  We have tried to keep it as free
             of jargon as possible, but a basic level of  familiarity with
             networking and data communications concepts is assumed.

                  Many of the terms in this glossary are common  to Tymnet
             technology  and  to  the  field  of  data  communications  in
             general.   However,  the definitions  and  explanations given
             here relate specifically to  Tymnet-II node code and  may not
             be valid more generally.

                  Comments  and suggestions  for improvement  are welcome.

        :ABSOLUTE ADDRESS - The unMACed or physical address.   An absolute
             address  is  one  which is  simply  an  offset  into physical
             memory.   Without the  MAC there  would be  no other  type of
             addressing.

        :ACHN - See ANCHN.

        :ACK - ACKnowledgement.  The control message sent  between devices
             to signal the correct receipt of a block of data.

        :ACN -  ABSOLUTE CHANNEL  NUMBER - A  channel's number  (or index)
             relative to the entire range of channels on a node.

             Each channel in a node is uniquely identified by its absolute
             channel number.   The ACN  is used as  an index  into various
             tables  and  bit  arrays which  contain  information  about a
             channel  (see,  for example,  ACP,  NFLAGS,  PERMUTER TABLE).
             ACN's  are always  in hex  and range  from 20x  to  the total
             number  of  channels  on the  node  (minus  1).   The largest
             possible ACN on any node is 7FFFx.  (ACN's in the range 0-1Fx
             have special meanings  and do not designate  actual channels;
             see BF.)

             A channel may also have a relative channel number (RCN) which
             identifies it within a  specified sub-range of channels  on a
             node.  The ACN of a  channel can be calculated from  its RCN,
             and vice versa.  (See RELATIVE CHANNEL NUMBER).

             Some   ACN's   have  fixed   assignments   in   certain  node
             configurations:

             20x-2Fx:  Always used for command circuit ports.

             30x-3Fx:  Always used for internal host process ports.

             40x:  On  Solo Tymsats/Consats, always  the ACN of  the first
                       async port.

             40x:  On ISIS nodes and Solo Supervisor nodes, always the ACN
                       of the first Kernel port.

             40x:  On  Solo switcher  nodes, always the  ACN of  the first
                       link channel.

             60x:  On ISIS nodes, usually the ACN of the  first Dispatcher
                       port.  (Not so if NKU is greater than 32d).  On Sup
                       machines 60x is the first Sup port.

        :ACP - Active port bit array, used to indicate the status  (in use
             or available) of channels.

             For every channel in a node, there is a corresponding  bit in
             the ACP which indicates whether the channel is  available (1-
             bit) or in use (0-bit).  If the ACP indicates that  a channel
             is  in use  (active), it  usually means  that the  channel is
             connected to a circuit.

             ACP is indexed by  absolute channel number.  There is  also a
             negative ACP bit array which is a mirror image of ACP  and is
             used simply to double-check the status of channels.  Negative
             ACP is indexed  by the 2's complement  of the ACN.   The XRAY
             'AC' command displays the ACN's of channels which  are marked
             "in use" in the ACP.

        :ACTIVE CHANNEL - A channel which is in use -- i.e., not available
             for circuit-building.

             An  active channel  (indicated  by a  0-bit in  the  ACP) may
             already  be connected  to  a circuit,  or  it may  be  in the
             process of being connected to or disconnected from a circuit.
             In any  case, it cannot  be "connected" to  a new  circuit so
             long as it is active.

        :ANCHN - Link descriptor  field for the number of  active channels
             on a  link; corresponds to  the ACHN field  of the  XRAY 'KD'
             display.

             For a link  that is not  up, this field  is always 0.   For a
             link that  is up, it  is always at  least 2.  (The  first two
             channels on a link are reserved for special purposes  and are

             always  considered active  if the  link is  up.)  For  a T-II
             link, the number of actual circuits on a link is equal to the
             ANCHN value minus  2.  For T-I  links, this field  is usually
             inaccurate and therefore meaningless.

        :BACKGROUND - In an ISIS node, the bottom level at which  all node
             code functions which are not closely tied  to interrupt-level
             processing are performed.  See also FOREGROUND  and INTERRUPT
             LEVEL.

             Background  tasks  run  when  the  processor  is   free  from
             foreground  or interrupt  level demands.   This is  where the
             bulk of the  work is done, after  the demands of  the outside
             world  have been  met.  Anything  that is  not  foreground or
             interrupt level is background.

             Note that a successful ISIS slot assumes that the  demands of
             foreground and interrupt level tasks leave free time  for the
             background to  run.  ISIS  does not  actively do  anything to
             assure that background tasks get time to run.

        :BACKPRESSURE - The process by which data flow in one direction on
             a circuit is temporarily stopped.

             There are actually  two different backpressure  mechanisms in
             T-II.  In one of  them, backpressure is applied  and relieved
             explicitly as appropriate  -- for instance, between  the node
             code and the ISIS Dispatcher.  In this case, it is up  to the
             receiving process  to let  the sending  process know  when it
             must stop and when it may resume sending data on a channel.

             At the  link level  (i.e., for  data flowing  between nodes),
             backpressure  is applied  automatically by  the  sending node
             whenever a channel's backpressure limit is reached.  The flow
             of  data stays  off until  backpressure is  relieved  for the
             channel by the receiving node.

             Each link channel has a backpressure limit which is  based on
             the circuit's  throughput class.   The backpressure  limit is
             the maximum amount of data  that will be sent on  the channel
             before backpressure relief  is received.  If  backpressure is
             relieved  for  a  channel before  its  backpressure  limit is
             reached (as  is usually the  case), the flow  of data  on the
             channel is never backpressured.

             Backpressure relief  is sent every  half-second for  all link
             channels which qualify.  A channel qualifies for backpressure
             relief if the amount of data in its buffer (i.e.,  data which
             have  been  received  on the  channel)  does  not  exceed the
             channel's backpressure limit.

        :BACKPRESSURE RELIEF MESSAGE - A special type of message sent by a

        GLOSSARY                                                  July 13, 1987


             node  to   its  neighbors  every   half  second   to  relieve
             backpressure on link channels.

             For  T-II  links,  the backpressure  relief  message  has the
             following format, where '< >' is a 1-byte quantity:

                   <C0+n><c1><c2>...<cn>

             where 'n' is a count (0 to 3Fx) of channels for which
                           backpressure is being relieved; 

                   'c1 c2 ... cn' are 'n' ID's of channels for which
                           backpressure is being relieved.


             Note that  this message  is sent every  half second,  even if
             there  are  no  channels  for  which  backpressure  is  to be
             relieved (in which case 'n' is 0 and the entire message  is 1
             byte long).

             A channel qualifies for backpressure relief if the  amount of
             data in its (destination)  buffer is less than  the circuit's
             BACKPRESSURE LIMIT.   This means that  the maximum  amount of
             data that  can be accumulated  in a buffer  is a  little less
             than 2 times the circuit's backpressure limit.

        :BAD ACK - An error condition  on a link when a frame  is received
             which has an invalid ACK field.

             The acknowledgement field of a received frame cannot  be less
             than the last acknowledgement received (LAR); it must also be
             within window-size of  LAR.  This error  can occur only  on a
             single-line link -- i.e., it is not an error if it  occurs on
             a multiple-line link since it is possible to  receive packets
             out of order due to differing frame sizes and/or  line speeds
             on a multiple-line link.

             A frame with a bad ACK field is considered valid, but the ACK
             is not used to update the LAR field of the link descriptor.

        :BAD BORI - An error condition  on a SYNC LINE when the  first few
             bits of a potential frame do not match any valid BORI.

             See BORI for an explanation of what constitutes a valid BORI.

             This error is usually the  result of "noise" on an  idle sync
             line.

        :BAD GUY LIST - A list of nodes which are not valid  neighbors for
             a node.

             A node will not bring up  a link to any node which is  on its

             bad guy list.  This is accomplished by simply  ignoring RESET
             frames which contain a prohibited node number.  A  node's bad
             guy list may  be modified through  XRAY ('BG' command)  or on
             command  from the  Supervisor --  message types  '0F89' (stop
             talking to node) and '0F8A' (start talking to node).  Receipt
             of a '0F89' supervisor  message also causes the node  to BORI
             ZAP the link to the specified node if one exists.

        :BAD RECORD NUMBER - An error condition on a link when a  frame is
             received with an invalid frame (record) number.

             If the  record number  field of a  received frame  is greater
             than the record number of the last record torn (LRT), it must
             be within window-size of LRT.  This error can occur only on a
             single-line link -- i.e., it is not an error if it  occurs on
             a multiple-line link since  it is possible to  receive frames
             out of order due to differing frame sizes and/or  line speeds
             on a multiple-line link.

             A received frame with  a bad record number is  not considered
             valid and is ignored.

        :BANDWIDTH - The capacity of a line or link, usually  expressed as
             the number of bits (BPS) or characters (CPS) per second it is
             capable of transmitting and receiving.

             The bandwidth of a link  is the sum of the bandwidths  of all
             lines on the  link.  The "total bandwidth"  of a node  is the
             aggregate of the bandwidths of all links on the node.

        :BANDWIDTH  UTILIZATION  - The  ratio  of the  number  of physical
             characters transmitted  or received  on a  link to  the total
             possible cps rate for a given link speed.

        :BAUDR - An optional Tymfile parameter which defines the  speed of
             the Engine hardware clock for the node code.

             If BAUDR=0 (default), the node code assumes that the hardware
             clock is operating at 3600 Hz (herz, cycles per  second).  If
             BAUDR=2,  the node  code assumes  a clock  rate of  14400 Hz.
             BAUDR=2  is required  only for  nodes which  have  to support
             async  terminals  at  speeds  higher  than  1200  baud (i.e.,
             maximum baud rate of 4800).

             If BAUDR does not correspond to the actual clock rate  in the
             Engine, all sorts of strange things will happen.

        :BB - For each BUFFER, BB is the virtual address of the first byte
             of data currently in the buffer.

             BB is a FW table indexed by BUFFER INDEX.  If a buffer  is in
             use, its  BB will be  either 0 (in  which case the  buffer is

             empty) or some value  greater than CHRBUF.  If the  buffer is
             unassigned, the high-order  HW of its  BB points to  the next
             buffer in the free BUFFER  POOL.  If BB is 0, BE  (see below)
             must also be 0.  If BB is non-zero and is equal to  BE, there
             is exactly one byte in the buffer.

        :BCT - For each BUFFER,  BCT is the (approximate) number  of bytes
             currently in the buffer.

             BCT is a HW table indexed by BUFFER INDEX.  The actual number
             of bytes in the buffer is always within 13d of BCT.  BCT is 0
             if the buffer is  empty; otherwise BCT = 1  + 14d * (n  - 1),
             where 'n' is the number of BUFFERLETS currently  allocated to
             the buffer.

        :BE - For each BUFFER, BE is the virtual address of the  last byte
             of data in the buffer.

             If a buffer is in use, its BE will be either 0 (in which case
             the buffer is empty)  or some value greater than  CHRBUF.  If
             BE is 0, BB must also  be 0.  If BE is non-zero and  is equal
             to BB, there is exactly 1 byte in the buffer.  If  the buffer
             is unassigned, its BE will be 0.

        :BF - For a BUFFER which is connected to a circuit, BF is  the ACN
             of the buffer's  destination channel; otherwise,  BF reflects
             the current status of the buffer.

             BF is a HW  table indexed by BUFFER  INDEX.  If BF is  in the
             range 20x through  7FFFx, then BF is  the ACN of  the channel
             toward which data in the buffer will flow.

             If  BF  is  DEADx,  then  the  buffer  is  unassigned  (i.e.,
             available).

             Otherwise, BF  will have  one of  the following  values which
             indicate that  the buffer is  in some transitional  state (in
             the  process of  being connected  to or  disconnected  from a
             circuit):

             0       - The circuit with which the buffer  was   associated
                       was recently zapped; the buffer   will  be returned
                       to the free pool as soon as   the zapper clears.

             10x-17x - The buffer is connected to a port in  LOGIN   MODE;
                       the buffer  will be returned  to the  free   buffer
                       pool as soon as the login is completed.

             1Cx      -  The  buffer  has been  connected  to  a  T-I link
                       channel  by  an  ASSIGN  CHANNEL  command  from the
                       Supervisor; any data received on the channel   will

             1Dx     - The buffer is in INTERCEPT STATE in a node at   the

                       processed  by  CRQ;  when  the  circuit  segment is
                       completed, BF will contain a valid ACN.

        :BOOT  -  A  special  program  located  in  PROM  on   the  Engine
             multifunction  card; performs  the functions  of  loading and
             dumping the Engine.

             The boot version number shows in right-most column of console
             display.  Version 6 is needed to load over an SIO line.

             Split sup has a special boot for SIO ring load.

        :BORI   -  Beginning-Of-Record   Indicator.   The   four-bit  sync
             character of a T-II frame.

             There are several different types of frames, and each  can be
             identified by its first few bits (see FRAME).  The  one thing
             that all  BORI's have in  common is that  the first bit  of a
             BORI (and  therefore of a  frame) is always  '0'.  On  a sync
             line, this  is what enables  the code to  figure out  where a
             potential  frame  begins --  an  idle sync  line  transmits a
             continuous stream of 1-bits,  so any occurence of a  0-bit in
             that stream may indicate the start of a frame.

        :BORI ZAP - What a node does to a link to force it to go down.

             Bori zapping a link involves sending out reset frames  on all
             lines attached to the link.  This causes the link neighbor to
             put the lines in reset  state at its end.  Normally  the link
             will come back up again shortly thereafter, unless one of the
             nodes is on the other's bad guy list.

             A node will bori zap a link in on command from the Supervisor
             (see BAD GUY LIST) or from XRAY ('BZ' command).  It will also
             do so under certain  conditions when the integrity of  a link
             is in question (see LINK SNIP).

        :BUBBLE -  The process  by which a  T-II link  acquires additional
             channels in order to accomodate new circuits.

             When a node needs to add a new circuit to a link, it may find

        GLOSSARY                                                  July 13, 1987


             that all the  channels allocated to  the link are  already in
             use.  When this happens, the node will attempt to  allocate a
             block of 80x (128d) additional channels to the link.  This is
             called a link bubble.

             When a link bubble occurs, the newly allocated  channels have
             to be "inserted" into  place so they are contiguous  with the
             channels previously allocated.  This results in  shifting the
             channels  allocated  to   other  links  to   accomodate  this
             "bubble".   When a  link  comes up,  it is  given  an initial
             allocation of 80x channels.  Channels are always  acquired --
             and released (see SHRINK) -- in groups of 80x.

             The total number of link channels available in a node (set at
             configuration   time)  can   be  allocated   in   almost  any
             combination among the node's T-II links.

             It is possible for a node to run out of link  channels.  When
             this happens, no  new links can come  up, and if  an existing
             link attempts to bubble, it will be taken down.

        :BUFFER - Temporary storage for data traveling on a circuit.

             Contrary  to  common  usage,  a node  code  buffer  is  not a
             specific area  of memory;  rather, it  is an  abstract entity
             which is defined  by a set  of "buffer descriptors"  (see BB,
             BE, BF, BCT).

             Every circuit has a pair  of buffers associated with it  in a
             node, one for each direction of data flow.  The even-numbered
             buffer of each pair  accumulates data which are  flowing from
             the circuit origin toward the destination; and vice versa for
             the odd-numbered buffer.

             Buffers are numbered consecutively from 0 to the end of their
             allocated  space,   but  for   convenience  they   are  often
             referenced by  "bufferindex" which is  four times  the buffer
             number.  This index is used for indexing into the  arrays BB,
             BE, BCT and BF.

             The data in a buffer  (if there are any) are  actually stored
             in BUFFERLETS which are "owned" by the buffer.

             Buffers are  pooled in  common and  are assigned  to channels
             only when needed  (i.e., when the  channel is connected  to a
             circuit).  A node  can never run  out of buffers  because the
             buffer pool contains a  buffer-pair for every channel  on the
             node.

        :BUFFERLET  - A  16-byte  area of  memory where  buffered  data is
             actually stored.



        XRAY52.DOC                 XRAY User's Guide                        144
        GLOSSARY                                                  July 13, 1987


             Each  bufferlet  can  hold  up  to  14d  bytes  of  data; the
             remaining  two bytes  contain the  link pointer  to  the next
             bufferlet.  The bufferlets "owned" by a buffer  are "chained"
             or  "linked" together  --  that  is, each  bufferlet contains
             information which points to the next bufferlet in  the chain.
             The last  bufferlet in a  buffer points  nowhere.  Bufferlets
             are pooled in common and are acquired by BUFFERs  when needed
             to hold  data.  When  a bufferlet  is no  longer needed  by a
             buffer, it is returned to the free bufferlet pool.   An empty
             buffer will not "own" any bufferlets.

        :BUG - An undocumented feature of the node code which,  because it
             is  not  generally  well  understood  by  users  and  support
             personnel,  tends  to  cause  distress  and  consternation in
             certain quarters when it manifests itself unexpectedly.

             Bugs are  generally regarded as  deficiencies in the  code by
             the uninitiated.  But, as any development programmer knows, a
             piece  of code  without bugs  is like  peanut  butter without
             chunks --  not very interesting.   This attitude  applies, of
             course, only to  bugs which are not  of your own  making.  To
             the person who  created a bug, it  is always the result  of a
             totally  inexplicable corruption  of the  source code  by the
             PDP-10 monitor or some  other sinister force which  is intent
             on screwing up even the most elegant and  meticulously tested
             algorithm.

        :CHANNEL - A unique number which  is used by one end of  a circuit
             segment to find its associated buffer resources.

             Each  node   has  a   fixed  number   of  channels   (set  at
             configuration time)  which represents  the maximum  number of
             circuit connections that can  be made in the  node.  Channels
             are grouped according to  destination.  The lower end  of the
             range  of  a   node's  channels  are  reserved   for  circuit
             connections which terminate  on the node  (Dispatcher, async,
             internal  host  processes).   These  channel  assignments are
             fixed -- i.e., a given channel in any of these  ranges always
             leads to the same process or interface.  The upper end of the
             node's  channel  range is  a  common pool  of  link channels.
             Channels from this pool are allocated to links (in  groups of
             80x) as they are needed through the BUBBLE  process; channels
             which are no longer needed by links are returned to  the pool
             through the SHRINK process.  Link channel assigments  are not
             fixed; a channel which is "owned" by link at one time  may be
             owned by another some other time.

        :CHANNEL TRACE - An XRAY feature which permits tracing of  data on
             a  circuit segment within a node.

        :CHARACTER PAIR  - A two-byte  message which is  used by  the node
             code to perform various control functions.

             These  character  pairs  travel through  the  network  as one
             entity  and should  not be  separated.  The  first byte  of a
             character pair  is always 00,  01, or 03.   Some 03-character
             "pairs" are actually sextets.  See CONTROL CODES.

        :CHECKSUM - The last four bytes of a PACKET, used to determine the
             integrity  of  the data  in  a packet;  also  the  process of
             computing the checksum bytes for a packet.

             The checksum field of a packet consists of two 2-byte values,
             the first of which  is the vertical checksum for  the packet,
             and  the second  of which  is the  diagonal checksum  for the
             packet.

             On an SIO link data  frames are enclosed in an  HDLC envelope
             which  includes a  hardware computed  cyclic  redundancy code
             (CRC).

        :CHECKSUM ERROR - An error  condition on a line which  is detected
             when a node  receives a packet  whose checksum fields  do not
             match the checksums calculated for the received packet.  This
             packet is then ignored.

        :CIRCUIT -  A virtual  path through the  network along  which data
             travels  in both  directions between  two users  (typically a
             terminal and a host computer).

        :CIRCUIT BUILDING - The process by which a circuit is built.

             A  T-II  circuit  is  built  by  sending  a  NEEDLE  from the
             originating  node,  through  a  series  of  intermediate  (or
             passthrough) nodes,  to the  destination node.   (The circuit
             path, or sequence of nodes through which the  circuit passes,
             is  defined by  the Supervisor.)   As each  node in  the path
             receives  the  needle,  it  makes  the   appropriate  channel
             connections and buffer allocations to support its  segment of
             the circuit; it then sends the needle on to the next  node in
             the path.  When the needle reaches its destination, the final
             connection is made to  a terminating channel and  the circuit
             is complete.

        :CIRCUIT SEGMENT  - The  portion of  a circuit  which exists  in a
             single node.

             A circuit  segment connects  two CHANNELS  within a  node.  A
             circuit consists of one or more circuit segments in the nodes
             along the circuit path.

        :CIRCUIT STUB  - A  channel which  is connected  to a  partial (or
             half-) circuit and is waiting for a needle to make the proper
             connection to the rest of the circuit.

        :CLOCK INTERRUPTS  - Interrupts which  are generated at  a regular
             (and  high)  rate  by  the  Engine  hardware  clock  and  are
             processed by the code to update the software clocks, etc.

        :COMMAND CIRCUIT - A circuit between the currently  active network
             Supervisor  and  a  T-II  node,  over  which  all  Supervisor
             communications for the node travel.

             COMMAND CIRCUITS  may pass through  other T-II  nodes between
             the  terminating node  and the  Supervisor.   COMMAND CIRUITS
             have all the  features of any  other circuit in  the network,
             i.e.,  they are  subject to  backpressure (flow  control) but
             data is not multiplexed  with other user's data.   T-II nodes
             must have a  COMMAND CIRCUIT before  they are visible  in the
             network.

        :COMPLEMENTARY BUFFER -  The other buffer of  a buffer pair  -- it
             holds data traveling in the opposite direction on a circuit.

        :CONSAT - The CONsolidated tymSAT, a product which encompasses the
             functions  of  the  asynchronous  TYMSAT,   asynchronous  SIO
             support, PVC  and multiplexed PVC  support, and  2741 printer
             support in an environment  which is capable of running  in an
             ISIS  or a  SOLO software  system.  When  running in  an ISIS
             configuration the CONSAT also supports the X.28  pad, various
             types of TELEX and asynchrous OUTDIAL.

        :CONTEXT  SWITCHER  -  A  portion of  T-II  SOLO  node  code which
             regulates the execution of independent processes in a node.

             The code which runs in a T-II SOLO node actually  consists of
             two or three independent processes each of which  has control
             of the machine  in turn for  different amounts of  time.  The
             processes are the node code itself, local (TTY) XRAY, and the
             Kernel  (only  in  a  Supervisor  Base  configuration).   The
             context switcher makes sure  that each process gets  its turn
             and runs  only as long  as it is  supposed to  before another
             process takes over.

         :CONTROL CODES -  An unescaped byte of  data in the range  00x to
             07x  which  performs some  sort  of control  function  in the
             network.

             '00'  is  an escape  character  for data  bytes.   Since byte
             values  of  '00' to  '07'  all have  significance  as control
             codes, actual data bytes  in that range are  distinguished by
             prefixing  them  with  a  '00'.  The  second  byte  of  a 00-
             character pair is treated as data.

             '01' is a prefix character for Virtual Terminal Signal Codes.
             The second  byte of a  01-character pair defines  the control
             function to be performed.   See APPENDIX I of  TYMNET Circuit
             Protocols  for a complete list.

             '02' is a Tymnet-I GOBBLER.  It can be received from  or sent
             to a T-I node only.

             '03'  has two  very different  identities.  When  sent  to or
             received from a T-I node, it is a ZAPPER.  When  traveling in
             or between T-II nodes it  is always the first character  of a
             control sequence (of two to six bytes) which performs  one of

             '04' is a LDEM (leave-deferred-echo-mode) control code.

             '05' is a GREEN BALL.  (See TYMNET Circuit Protocol)

             '06' is a RED BALL.  (See TYMNET Circuit Protocol)

             '07' is an EDEM (enter-deferred-echo-mode) control code.

        :CRASH OPTIONS - A  set of parameters which determine  what action

             The  summary table  is a  push-down stack,  meaning  that the
             first entry is  for the last crash,  the second entry  is the
             previous crash, and so on.  The crash table will not be over-
             written  by  repetitive  loads  and  the  software  will  not
             initialize it.  Thus if the machine is reloaded with the same
             code we  can still read  out old crash  information.  Crashes
             caused by power failures  and manual restarts are  not logged
             for ISIS node code.

             The  Crash Detail  Table contains  only the  oldest  and most
             recent  crashes.   Additionally, register  set  0  (SOLO node
             only),  user register  set and   MAC registers  (300-35F) are
             provided.

        :CRQ  - A  routine in  the node  code (in  SWITCH)  which performs
             circuit-building functions within the node.

        :CRSHID - CRaSH IDentification.

             The crash ID is equal to zero when the node first comes up.
             If set to:
                4 - the crash is due to an illegal instruction;
                8 - the cause is a Memory Access Controller violation;
               10 - the cause is a condition detected by the node code.
             Manual restart and power fail do not change CRSHID.


        :CRYPTO  MESSAGES  - These  diagnostic  messages  are continuously
             generated  by the node code.  The most recent 256  are stored
             in the Crypto buffer.

        :DAUGHTER BOARDS  - Interface boards  connected to the  SIO mother
             board.   The  various  daughter  board  interfaces  are V.29,
             V.35/RS232, OC-SIO, and ASYNC.

        :DEADEND  CIRCUIT -  A partial  circuit which  ends  without being
             properly terminated --  that is, it ends  on a point  that is
             not  a legitimate  circuit  termination point  (e.g.,  a link
             channel).

        :DELAY MEASUREMENT CIRCUIT - A special kind of circuit that can be
             built from XRAY to measure throughput delay in a portion of a
             network.

        :DETACHED  PORT  -  A  channel which  is  used  to  put  a circuit
             temporarily  in  limbo  because  the  circuit  could  not  be
             completed  to  the  requested  destination;  the  circuit  is
             eventually zapped.   The use  of the  detached port  allows a
             detach reason to be sent to the circuit origination.

        :DISMISS -  What a process  does when it  gives up control  of the
             machine  to a  higher-level process  (voluntary  dismiss), or
             what is done to  a process when a higher-level  process takes
             control of the machine away from it (forced dismiss).

        :DISPATCHER INTERFACE -  The node code process  which communicates
             with the ISIS Dispatcher.

             The Dispatcher interface works by means of a pair of rings or
             circular "buffers" (not the same as BUFFERs), DIRING for data
             passing from the node  code to the Dispatcher and  DORING for
             data passing  from the Dispatcher  to the node  code.  DIRING
             and DORING are saved after a crash in DIRSAV and DORSAV.

        :DISPI - A  collection of processes in  an ISIS node  which handle
             communications between  the node code  (Slot 0) and  the ISIS
             Dispatcher.

        :DMA  -  Direct  Memory  Access.   A  facility  that  permits  I/O
             transfers   directly into  or out  of memory  without passing
             through the processor's general registers.

        :DUMMY RECORD - A special FRAME which contains no data and is used
             only to  maintain a  minimum level  of traffic  on a  LINE in
             order to keep lightly used lines up on a multi-line link.

        :ESCAPE - A  CONTROL BYTE ('00') which  is prefixed to  data bytes
             '00' through '07' in  order to distinguish them  from control
             bytes of the same value.

        :EXEC LOOP -  The node code process  which controls all  the other
             processes.

        :FASTC - Symbol for the node's FAST Clock (FW value).

             FASTC  "ticks"  600d  times  a  second  and  is  the highest-
             resolution software clock in the node code.  It is updated by

        GLOSSARY                                                  July 13, 1987


             the CLOCK  INTERRUPT routine,  and so is  as accurate  as the
             Engine's hardware clock will allow.

             FASTC is  used for  a wide variety  of timing  functions that
             require high resolution.  One  "tick" of FASTC is  about 1.67
             ms.  FASTC is in the XRAY symbol table.

        :FAT  GOBBLER -  A  special type  of gobbler  used  on potentially
             rebuildable circuits.  The CONTROL CODE is 03-09  followed by
             a FW new sequence number.

        :FAT  ZAPPER  -  A  special kind  of  zapper  used  on potentially
             rebuildable circuits.  The CONTROL CODE is 03-04  followed by
             a node pair.

        :FOREGROUND - Under ISIS,  a foreground process is scheduled  on a
             regular basis for a limited period of time, after  which ISIS
             snatches control back from the process and continues with its
             scheduling  of  other processes.   A  foreground  process can
             dismiss  itself and  allow some  other process  to run  if it
             finishes its work before its time slice has expired.

             Foreground tasks do  work of the  time critical sort.   In an
             ISIS  node code  configuration  the only  foreground  task is
             SYLVER,  which performs  all  sync input  processing  and SIO
             input  and  output  processing.   See  also   BACKGROUND  and
             INTERRUPT LEVEL.

        :FRAME - Also known as PACKET.

        :GATEWAY - A node or switch that permits communication between two
             networks.

        :GOBBLER - A control code which "erases" buffered data in its path
             as it travels along a circuit.

             A gobbler  is used  to "flush" data  from a  circuit (usually
             because  it  is no  longer  wanted); it  does  not  cause the
             circuit to be  torn down and does  not affect any  data which
             follow it.

        :GOUGING LEVEL - See THROUGHPUT CLASS.

        :GUSH -  An active  channel on  which data  is received  in groups
             (logical  records)  of  n (or  greater)  number  of  bytes is
             considered to be GUSHing; contrast with TRICKL.  N is defined
             by default according to throughput class:

             These variables may also be defined in the TYMFILE.

             The GUSH  array is used  by RMAKE each  half second  to check
             whether or not to relieve backpressure for a  channel.  RMAKE
             will  check  only  GUSHing channels  every  half  second (and
             TRICKLing channels  every four  seconds).  The  rationale for
             this seems to be that if a channel has not been sending a lot
             of data we needn't worry about letting it send more.

        :HALT - An engine processor  state in which nothing can  happen in
             the software.

        :HARD ZAPPER - The usual kind of zapper -- it tears down a circuit
             without mercy.

        :HISTORY  BUFFER  -  In  a node  on  which  a  rebuildable circuit
             terminates, a buffer used to  store a copy of the  data which
             has been transmitted on the circuit.

        :HYBRID CIRCUIT - A circuit whose path includes both T-II  and T-I
             nodes.

        :I/O   SECTORS  -   INPUT/OUTPUT  SECTORS   contain   the  packets
             themselves, and are pointed to by record  descriptors.  Input
             sector contains the packets as they are received on the link.
             Output  sector contains  the packets  which are  ready  to be
             transmitted.

        :INTER-LINK CONTROL MESSAGES - Channel 0 messages received  from a
             neighbor, such as the  32-bit key used in  multi-line resets,
             zapper acknowledgements and trace messages.

        :INTERNAL HOST - One of  several processes in the node  code which
             handle circuit  terminations for  internal functions  such as
             downline loading, remote XRAY, and delay measurement.

             The internal host  processes in a  node are all  accessed via
             the KERNEL HOST number.  See also SLOT HOST, ACCOUNTING HOST.

        :INTERRUPT  LEVEL PROCESSING  - An  interrupt level  task requests
             attention  at  the  prompting  of  some  external  device  or
             process.  The processor provides service as soon  as possible
             and has a  scheme of mediating among  conflicting interrupts.
             An interrupt  will take  the processor  from a  foreground or

        GLOSSARY                                                  July 13, 1987


             background  process  which  is running  at  the  time  of the
             interrupt.  See also BACKGROUND and FOREGROUND.

             From the node code's  point of view, there are  two important
             types  of  interrupts:  I/O  interrupts  (primarily  for SYNC
             LINES)  and interrupts  which  mean that  something  has gone
             wrong (illegal instruction, protection violation, etc.)

        :ISIS -  A node configuration  in which the  node code runs  in an
             ISIS slot (always slot 0); as opposed to SOLO.

        :ISIS XRAY  - There are  a few XRAY  commands which apply  only to
             ISIS nodes.  However, the most useful and commonly  used XRAY
             commands are identical in both SOLO and ISIS configurations.

        :KDLN -  A HW  array indexed by  (2 times  the) line  number which
             contains the address of  the link descriptor for the  link to
             which a line is attached (XRAY symbol table).

        :KERNEL - A process, separate from the node code (or  local XRAY),
             to which  the node  code communicates  over a  special kernel
             interface.  The  kernel process  may be  running on  the same
             engine  as  the  node  code,  as  with  ISIS  and  Standalone
             Supervisor  Kernels,  or  the kernel  may  be  resident  in a
             separate engine as with the Split Supervisor Kernel.

        :KERNEL HOST  - The host  number associated with  the KERNEL  in a
             node; every  node has  one, even  if it  doesn't have  a true
             kernel.

        :LEP - The LEPrechaun is the process by which each port on  a node
             talks to the supervisor.  All commands from the supervisor to
             a node go through the LEP.

        :LINE  -  A  physical connection  between  two  nodes,  over which
             electrical signals representing data bits can be passed.

        :LINE  ATTACH  PROCESS  -  The process  by  which  a  line becomes
             attached to (comes up on) a link.

             A line which is not attached to a link is ordinarily in RESET
             state -- it is  continually transmitting reset frames  with a
             "pingpong" count  of 0 (see  RESET).  As soon  as a  reset is
             received on  a line, indicating  the presence of  a potential
             neighbor at the other end, the line attach process begins.

             The process is different for T-I and T-II links, but  in both
             cases it involves the  exchange of a certain number  of reset
             frames  between  the  two  nodes.   Once  the  reset exchange
             sequence is complete,  each node can  attach the line  to its
             side of the link.

             During  the  attach  process,  the  speed  of  the   line  is
             calculated, based how long it takes a complete reset frame to
             be transmitted (on an SIO line) or received (on a sync line).

             A line which is in  the process of being attached  may, under
             certain conditions, be suspended for a short time.   See LINE
             SUSPENDED.

        :LINE DETACH PROCESS - The process by which the node code detaches
             a line from a link.

        :LINE SPEED  - The speed  at which  data is put  out onto  a line,
             usually expressed in kilobits per second (KBPS).

        :LINE  TRACE -  A  facility in  XRAY which  activates  tracing for
             headers received  on a specified  unattached line.   Once the
             line  comes up  and is  attached, line-level  tracing  has no
             effect for that line until it becomes unattached again.

        :LINK  - A  path between  two nodes,  over which  data  travels in
             packets.

             A link  is a  logical connection between  two nodes.   It may
             have one or more lines attached to it.

        :LINK DESCRIPTOR - An  table in memory which  contains information
             about a link.  (See XRAY 'KD' command.)

        :LINK OVERLOAD - A link  condition detected by the node  code when
             the  active channels  on a  link are  not  receiving adequate
             service by RMAKE.

        :LINK TRACE - A facility in XRAY which permits tracing, on  a link
             basis, of "events" detected  by RMAKE, RTEAR, and  the SYLVER
             packet receiver routines.

        :LINK TYPE - Relates  to two different characteristics of  a link:
             1)  whether it  is  a defined  (TIILNK) link  or  a wild-card
             (XLINK) link; and 2) whether it is to a T-I or T-II neighbor.

        :LOCAL  XRAY -  XRAY as  it is  accessed through  the TTY  port or
             through ISIS DDT.

        :LOGICAL CHARACTER - Technically, only actual data  characters are
             considered logical characters; all the rest are overhead.

        :LOGICAL RECORD - The portion of a packet which contains  data for
             a single channel (circuit).

             A logical record has the following format:

                  <cc><nn><... data ...>

             where <cc> is the count of bytes in the logical record;
                   <nn> is the channel number to which the data belongs;
                    and <... data ...> is <cc> bytes of data.


             The <nn> field is the RELATIVE CHANNEL NUMBER for the link on
             which the packet is sent or received; it is also  relative to
             the current  PAGE in effect  for the link.   Thus, if  <nn> =
             '7C',  the  actual  RCN  may  be  '07C'  or  '17C'  or '27C',
             depending on the most recent PAGE CHANGE COMMAND  received on
             the link.  This technique  allows a large number  of channels
             to be supported on a link without having a lot  of additional
             overhead data in the logical records to identify them.

        :LOOPBACK CIRCUIT - A special  kind of circuit which can  be built
             from XRAY to test the throughput and delay characteristics of
             a link.

        :MAC - Memory Access Controller.

        :MAC'D ADDRESS - See VIRTUAL ADDRESS.

        :MASTER - On any link, the node with the higher node number.

        :MEMORY SIZE -  The amount of physical  memory in a node  that the
             node  code knows  about;  always less  than or  equal  to the
             actual  amount of  physical memory  in the  machine.  Tymfile
             parameters are NBRK for SOLO nodes and S0CORE for ISIS nodes.

        :MOTHER BOARD - The  PCSIO or Printed Circuit  Serial Input/Output
             board  that controls  the operation  of the  daughter boards,
             translating commands from the CPU on the MUX bus into control
             signals for them, and transferring data between  the daughter
             boards and the engine memory via DMA.

             This symbol may be defined in the Tymfile (default  is 256d).
             It should  never be set  to a value  greater than  the actual
             amount of physical memory in the node.

             The node code  may or may not  use all the memory  defined as

        :NEEDLE POINT - The first two bytes of a NEEDLE which  identify it
             as a needle (03-10).

        :NEIGHBOR NODE - The node at the other end of a link.

        :NODE - A  point of a network  where various links  come together;
             generally  containing  a  switching  element  used  to direct
             traffic.

        :NULL PACKET - A packet which contains no logical record data; not
             to be confused with DUMMY PACKET.

             A null packet is sent  when a packet would not  ordinarily be
             sent, but when the sending node needs to acknowledge properly
             received  packets from  a neighbor  in order  to free  up the
             neighbor's  window.  A  node  will send  a null  packet  to a
             neighbor  after it  has found  no ordinary  reason to  send a
             packet (that is,  no data and  no backpressure relief)  or is
             unable to send a packet because of  backpressure limitations,
             and  it   has  received   two  packets   which  it   has  not
             acknowledged.

        :NXUBLK - An assembly parameter  which may be set in  the Tymfile;
             defines the maximum number  of users that may be  logged into
             remote XRAY at a time.  Default is equal to three.

        :PACKET - The basic unit of inter-node (link level) communication;
             also  called a  "physical record".   Corresponds to  FRAME in
             international standard (CCITT) terminology.

             All  data that  pass between  two nodes  are contained  in an
             "envelope" called a packet.   A packet consists of  a header,
             one  or  more bytes  of  data (usually  organized  in LOGICAL
             RECORDS),  and four  bytes  of CHECKSUM.   There  are several
             different  kinds of  packets (see  RESET, NULL  RECORD, DUMMY
             RECORD), the most important of which is the data packet.

             A T-II data packet has the following format:

             <bori><count><ack><recn><... logical records ...><checksum>

             <bori> is a 4-bit value which identifies the sending  node as
                       the MASTER  (<bori>=2) or  SLAVE (<bori>=1)  on the
                       link.

             <count> is a 4-bit length code.  Byte length of packet =  8 *
                       <count> + 8.  The <count> field ranges from 0  to F
                       (hex) -- i.e., a packet may be from 8 to 128d bytes
                       long.

             <ack> is the 1-byte  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT field of the  packet; it
                       identifies the last  packet from the  neighbor node
                       which has been torn down by the sending node.

             <recn> is the  1-byte record number  field of the  packet; it
                       uniquely  identifies  the packet  to  the receiving
                       node.  It ranges from 0-127.

             <... logical records ...> are one or more LOGICAL  RECORDS or
                       INTER-LINK CONTROL MESSAGES, each of which is  of a
                       length specified in the logical record or message.

             <checksum> is a 4-byte value used to establish  the integrity
                       of the data in the packet (see CHECKSUM).

             A T-II packet  always has a length  which is a multiple  of 8
             bytes; therefore, it may  contain some (as many as  7) unused
             or meaningless bytes.

        :PAGE - A group of 100x (256d) contiguous channels.   Channels are
             allocated to (and deallocated from) T-II links  in half-pages
             (groups of 80x or 128d) (see BUBBLE and SHRINK).

        :PAGE CHANGE COMMAND - If a  link has more than a page's  worth of
             channels allocated to it, the PAGE CHANGE COMMAND is  used to
             specify which  page the logical  record channel numbers  in a
             packet apply to.

        :PASSTHROUGH -  A circuit segment  in a node  which goes  from one
             link channel to another -- i.e., it does not terminate on the
             node.

        :PERIODIC LOGIC or  PERIODIC PROCESS - A  process which runs  on a
             scheduled, periodic basis, as  opposed to a process  which is
             event- or interrupt-driven.

        :PHYSICAL ADDRESS - Same as ABSOLUTE ADDRESS.

        :PHYSICAL CHARACTERS - All the bytes in a FRAME.

        :PORT - A channel, usually one which terminates on a  node.  Also,
             the termination of a physical line, as in async, sync  or SIO
             port.

        :PRIVILEGED  CODE  -  The  parts of  the  node  code  that  run in
             privileged mode -- i.e., any code which handles interrupts or
             accesses absolute memory.

        :RADIX  CONVENTIONS  -  Almost everything  in  T-II  has  a number
             associated with it; these numbers are typically  expressed in
             octal, decimal, or hexidecimal, depending on what  the number
             applies to.

        :REBUILD - A feature of T-II node code (versions 5+)  which, under
             certain conditions, permits circuits which are zapped  due to
             link outages to be rebuilt in a manner that is transparent to
             the user.  The Tymfile parameter is OPTION(REBLD).

             On a rebuildable  circuit, the node  at each end  (origin and
             destination) maintains a special HISTORY BUFFER for  the data
             that it  transmits on  the circuit.  Each  node also  keeps a
             sequential count of the bytes transmitted and received on the
             circuit.   The history  buffer always  contains the  last <n>
             bytes transmitted  by the  node, where  <n> is  never greater
             than the maximum number of bytes which could possibly  be "in
             transit" to  the node  on the other  end.  Thus,  the history
             buffer  always contains  at least  all the  data that  may be
             buffered in nodes along the circuit path at any one time.

             When a rebuildable circuit is zapped due to a link  outage, a
             special  zapper, called  a FAT  ZAPPER, is  used to  tear the
             circuit down.   The origin node  then requests a  new circuit
             path from the  Supervisor; if such  a path is  available, the
             circuit is rebuilt using  a special rebuild needle.   As soon
             as  the rebuilt  circuit is  complete, the  terminating nodes
             simply send each other the contents of their history buffers,
             along with  the sequence numbers  of the first  characters in
             those buffers.   Each node  uses the  sequence number  of the
             last character it had received before the circuit  got zapped
             to  synchronize  on   the  stream  of  history   data.   Once
             synchronization  is achieved,  circuit activity  resumes from
             where it had let off as though nothing had happened.

        :RECORD - See LOGICAL RECORD, PHYSICAL RECORD (FRAME).

        :RECORD  DESCRIPTORS  - Each  link  descriptor field  points  to a
             RECORD DESCRIPTOR value, which points to an I/O SECTOR.

        :RELATIVE CHANNEL NUMBER - A channel's number (or  index) relative
             to some subrange of a node's channels; the subrange typically
             "belongs" to a process (like the Dispatcher) or a link.

             The  entire  range of  channels  on a  node  is  divided into
             several sub-ranges  which "belong  to" specific  processes or
             interfaces.  Each  channel sub-range  has a  relative channel
             number 0 which corresponds  to an absolute channel  number in
             the node.

        :REMOTE  XRAY  -  XRAY  as it  is  accessed  remotely  through the
             network.

        :RESET - A special packet which is transmitted continuously on all
             unattached lines on a node.  The reset packet (or pattern) is
             used by a node to identify itself to a potential  neighbor on
             a line.

             Prior  to version  5.20 the  reset packet  had  the following
             format:

             <30><t><p><nnnn><cccccccc>[<... additional data ...>]

             where <t> is A (hex)  if there are no lines  already attached
                       to  the neighbor  node with  whom resets  are being
                       exchanged, or B (hex)  if the line is  a subsequent
                       line on an existing link.

             <p>  is the  "ping-pong" count  (4 bits).   Initially  0, the
                       ping-pong count  begins incrementing  as soon  as a
                       reset is received on a line.  The two nodes  on the
                       ends of of the line must successfully  exchange 16d
                       consecutive resets (with ping-pong counts from 0 to
                       Fx) before the line will be attached.

             <nnnn> is the node number of the node sending the reset.

             <cccccccc> is the version number.

             In  versions  5.2+ the  reset  pattern has  been  expanded as
             follows:

                   2. <count> is a 4-bit length code.  Byte length of

                   will contain a 3 -- i.e., indicating a 32-byte packet.

             DIAL-UP  NUMBER FOR  BACKUP will  be implemented  at  a later
             date.

        :RETRANSMISSION - The transmission on a link of a packet which has
             already been transmitted at least once before.

             On  any link,  a  node can  have  a fixed  maximum  number of
             packets  "outstanding"  (that  is,  packets  which  have been
             transmitted and for which acknowledgements have not  yet been
             received).  That limit is  called the link's WINDOW  SIZE and
             is set at configuration  time.  If that limit is  reached, no
             new  packets will  be  transmitted.  Instead,  the  node will
             begin  retransmitting the  oldest outstanding  packet  in the
             window until it  receives an acknowledgement for  that packet
             or any other packet in the window (see ACKNOWLEDGEMENT).

             Retransmissions typically result from one of  two conditions.
             The  most common  is LINE  ERRORS which  cause packets  to be
             corrupted in transmission.  If any packet is received  with a
             bad checksum, the receiving node will not acknowledge  it; it
             will also  not acknowledge  any subsequent  packets received,
             even if their checksums  are good, until the packet  in error
             is received  with a good  checksum (i.e.,  is retransmitted).
             Thus, anytime a packet is  corrupted on a link, at  least one
             retransmission will result.

             A second cause of retransmissions is a significant difference
             between  the  speed  with  which  two  nodes  on  a  link are
             processing data.  If one node (the re-transmitter)  is making

             and sending  packets a  great deal  faster than  the neighbor
             (re-receiver) node is tearing  them down, it is  possible for
             the second node to  fall behind in acknowledging  the packets
             it has received.  (Packets are acknowledged not when they are
             received, but  only after  they have  been torn  down.)  This
             might happen, for instance, between a SWITCHER and  a heavily
             loaded  ISIS node.   A  high retransmission  rate,  without a
             correspondingly  high  rate  of line  errors,  on  a  link is
             indicative of such a problem.

        :RMAKE - The process which  makes up packets to be  transmitted on
             links.

             RMAKE runs periodically for  each active link on a  node.  It
             looks for active channels on the link which have data waiting
             in buffers to be sent out on the link.  When it finds one, it
             makes a logical record for that channel and puts it  into the
             packet being made.

             RMAKE will attempt to make a packet for a link only  if there
             is room for the packet in the link's window.  If there  is no
             room, the link's BACKLOG count is incremented (see  XRAY 'KS'
             display) and RMAKE goes on to the next active link.

        :RTEAR -  The node  code process  which tears  down (disassembles)
             FRAMES received  on links into  logical records  and deposits
             the logical record data into the proper buffers.

        :S0CORE  -  An  assembly  parameter  (ISIS  only)  which  must  be
             specified in the Tymfile  which defines the amount  of memory
             available for the node code (slot 0).  Contrast with NBRK.

        :SATURATED - A link condition  which is detected by the  node when
             the line transmitters for the link are continuously busy.

        :SHRINK  -  The process  by  which  a T-II  link  gives  up unused
             channels when it no longer needs them; the inverse of BUBBLE.

             A T-II link which  has BUBBLEd beyond its  initial allocation
             of 80x channels may (and  usually does) get to a  point where
             it has a large number of unused channels.  This is  a natural
             result of circuits' being zapped as users log off at  the end
             of the workday.  When  this number becomes much  greater than
             80x, a contiguous  group of 80x  channels is returned  to the
             common  pool  of channel  resources.   All  record-making and
             -teardown activity is suspended on the link until  the shrink
             process is complete.

        :SIO  - Serial  Input/Output system  used to  interface high-speed
             serial communications lines to the engine via DMA.

        :SLAVE - On any link, the node with the lower node number.

        :SLOT  - A  slot is  the collection  of resources  allocated  to a
             single entity, and includes the particular process or  set of
             processes capable of using those resources.

        :SLOWC - Symbol for the node's slow clock.

             SLOWC "ticks" once a second.   It is used for a  wide variety
             of low-resolution timing functions.  (Contrast with FASTC.)

        :SOLO - A non-ISIS node configuration; also called STANDALONE.

        :SOLO XRAY - XRAY in a SOLO configuration.

             In  general,  XRAY   commands  and  features   which  involve
             accessing un-MAC'd  memory in  a node  are available  only in
             SOLO configurations.  However,  the most useful  and commonly
             used  XRAY  commands  are identical  in  both  SOLO  and ISIS
             configurations.

        :SPACING  ON  INPUT -  A  line error  condition  which  means that
             "noise" was detected by the sync line receiver;  "spacing" is
             the opposite of "marking",  which is the normal state  for an
             idle sync line.

        :SPLIT SUPERVISOR - A  SOLO Supervisor configuration in  which the
             node  code  and  Supervisor code  run  in  separate machines,
             though they constitute a single node.

        :SUPERVISOR - A process which runs on a node (but is separate from
             the  node code)  and which  performs the  centralized control
             functions for the network.

        :SUSPENDED CHANNEL - A channel which has been recently zapped.  It
             cannot be used as a link or kernel channel for one minute.

        :SUSPENDED  LINE  -  A  line  (non-attached)  which  has  been put
             temporarily in limbo  -- it will  not exchange resets  with a
             neighbor.

        :SWITCH - A collection of processes in the node code which perform
             various functions, primarily relating to circuit-building and
             teardown and WCI/GCI.

        :TAKEOVER - A supervisor  takes over a network by  discovering the
             current status of  the network and creating  a representation
             of this status in  its own memory and winning  the allegiance
             of the nodes  in the network.   A TAKEOVER is  completed when
             the  upstream pointers  of all  nodes point  to the  node the
             supervisor is running on.

        :THROUGHPUT  CLASS  - A  circuit  characteristic  which determines
             roughly how many characters per half second can  travel along
             the circuit.  Also refered to as gouging level.

        GLOSSARY                                                  July 13, 1987


             The  throughput class  of  a circuit  is  set at  the  time a
             circuit  is  requested   from  the  Supervisor.    A  default
             throughput  class  is  associated with  each  TID.   An async
             terminal  user  may  request a  special  throughput  class by
             typing in ^A, ^B, ^C, or ^D in his login string.

        :TIILNK - A macro which may be specified in the Tymfile  to define
             certain  characteristics of  a  link to  a  specific neighbor
             node.

        :TRANSMITTER -  A node  code process which  takes FRAMES  from the
             output sector and sends them out on sync or SIO lines.

        :TTY XRAY - Same as LOCAL XRAY.

        :UPSW TRACE -  A facility of the  Engine which permits  tracing of
             execution in  code by  generating an  interrupt every  time a
             jump instruction  is executed; the  node code  TRACER routine
             uses this facility to create a table of jump  addresses which
             can  be  examined   for  debugging  purposes.    The  Tymfile
             parameter is OPTION(UTRC).

        :VERSION - A number used to distinguish different  incarnations of
             the node code.

        :VIRTUAL  ADDRESS -  The MACed  or relocated  address.   A virtual
             address is  one which is  given to the  MAC to  determine the
             corresponding absolute address.

             Our particular MAC allows  memory to be addressed  in sixteen
             segments of 64 kilobytes each at a given time.   Benefits are
             that a virtual address need never be more than 20  bits long,
             whereas  an absolute  address may  be longer,  and  that each
             segment  can  be specified  to  have its  own  set  of access
             restrictions, such as read/write, read only, or execute only.

        :WINDOW SIZE - The maximum number of unacknowledged frames  that a
             node  will  send over  a  link.  When  window-size  number of
             frames  have been  sent, the  node will  begin retransmitting
             from the earliest unacknowledged frame.  Maximum  window size
             is 128.

        :XLINK -  A link for  which no specific  neighbor node  number has
             been defined in the Tymfile.

             An XLINK is a wild card link -- any neighbor node can come up
             on it.  The number of XLINKs on a node can be defined  in the
             Tymfile (default is 0).

             All link parameters  for an XLINK are  defaulted: window-size
             is  8,  number  of   channel-groups  is  8d,  link   type  is
             terrestrial, and link speed is undefined.

        :XRAY  -  An  interactive  monitoring  and  debugging  system that
             resides in TYMNET-II node code.

             XRAY is a tool for monitoring the status of nodes in a TYMNET
             network.   The user  can display  information about  a node's
             configuration, performance, and history.

        :ZAP - To tear down a circuit (or a link -- see BORI ZAP).

             A circuit is zapped by  sending a ZAPPER along it.   A zapper
             may  originate in  any node  in the  circuit path,  though it
             usually  comes  from  one  of  the  terminations  (origin  or
             destination).   (A  circuit  zap  which  originates  from  an
             intermediate node  in the  path is  always abnormal  -- i.e.,
             results from a link outage or node crash.  In this  case, two
             zappers are emitted, one in each direction on the circuit.)

             As a zapper travels along a circuit, the CIRCUIT  SEGMENTS in
             each node are torn down -- the channels and buffers connected
             to it are released.  When  the zapper reaches the end  of the
             circuit and the segment to the terminating interface  is torn
             down, the circuit ceases to exist.

        :ZAPPER - A CONTROL CODE which tears a circuit down as  it travels
             along  it (see ZAP).

             All  zappers  are  03-CHARACTER PAIRS,  though  some  of them
             include up to four  additional bytes of data.   Zappers comes
             in  several  flavors.  A  normal  or HARD  ZAPPER  erases any
             buffered data it  encounters on the circuit.   A NON-GOBBLING
             ZAPPER waits  patiently for data  in the circuit  pipeline to
             clear before  tearing down  the circuit  behind them.   A FAT
             ZAPPER contains  additional information  which is  needed for
             rebuild.
