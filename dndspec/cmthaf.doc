                                   1 -  INTRODUCTION







                               1.1  WHAT IS HALF-DUPLEX?


                  Half-Duplex operation is similar to the original CMT  mode of
        operation, Full-Duplex.  Both  are character modes  - 1 character  at a
        time is  sent from the  terminal to  CMT.   The difference is  echo: in
        Full-Duplex the network  must echo (either CMTI  or the Consat)  and in
        Half-Duplex  the  terminal  itself  echos  each  character.   Thus  the
        terminal must have certain local functions in order for the  local echo
        to  work  correctly  and  not  destroy  parts  of  the  screen.  Escape
        sequences are not echoed in either mode.

             Terminals  can work  in Half-Duplex  if they  have the  ability to
        support  locally controlled  protected areas  on the  screen,  and have
        sufficiently flexible local editing functions.  Otherwise, the terminal
        would be used in a Full-Duplex mode.






                            1.2  ADVANTAGES OF HALF-DUPLEX


                  Half-Duplex mode  gives a response  time advantage  since the
        local  echo  means  that  local  editing  functions  like  tab,  insert
        character, delete character,  etc all occur immediately.   The operator
        does not  have to wait  for a network  response to an  escape sequence.
        This is of  particular use when the  terminal is located far  away from
        the echoing interface, such as  between Europe and the USA,  or through
        multiple networks.

             There are also less escape  sequences for the operator to  have to
        remember, since the local functions are all key-labeled.

        With Half-Duplex mode operation, the Tymfile requires :


        1. Define macro for Half-Duplex mode terminal in macro DEFTRM.
           
           For example :

           DEFTRM macro [
                    .
                    .
                  VT100M        :VT100 terminal with Full-Duplex mode
                  ADD69M        :ADDS 60 or ADDS 90 with Full-Duplex mode
                  ADD60H        :ADDS 60 with Half-Duplex mode
                  ADM12H        :ADM 12PLUS with Half-Duplex mode

                                3 -  LOGGING IN TO CMT


             The  logon procedure  for CMT  Half-Duplex mode  operation  is the
        following :

        1. The user must set up his terminal in Half-Duplex mode.

        2. Enter a control-H before his username to force the CONSAT into
           Half-duplex mode.

        3. After logging in to CMT, select the Half-Duplex terminal when
           the select terminal type screen is present.

                                  4 -  FUNCTION KEYS


             Most of  the 3270  functions are supported  by CMT.   This section
        will list the 3270 functions  that CMT does support in  the Full-Duplex
        mode operation.






                                  4.1  FCNCLR (clear)


             The screen is cleared locally, CMT clears its internal  screen and
        the host is notified.  The cursor is moved to the first position on the
        screen.






                                4.2  KILL (zap circuit)


             CMT will zap the circuit and the operator is returned  to  'please
        log in :'.

             This function is invoked  by entering a control sequence  from the
        keyboard.






                                  4.3  FCNENT (enter)


             The application  program is  notified that  an ENTER  function has
        been requested.  Areas of  the screen  that have  been modified  by the
        operator are reported back to the application, as is the current cursor
        position.

        FUNCTION KEYS                                         December 11, 1986


                               4.4  DELCHA (delete char)


             This function is handled  locally by the terminal and  CMT updates
        its internal screen buffer.

             The character  at the  current cursor position  is moved,  and all
        characters in the  field to the right  of that position are  shift left
        one position.

             The delete  character function  in 3270  and CMT  Full-Duplex mode
        operation does not wrap a line,  but it does for the ADDS  VIEWPOINT 60
        terminal.






                                  4.5  RESET (reset)


             The RESET function in  3270 or CMT Full-Duplex mode  operation can
        do either one of the followings :

             1. Exit insert mode.

                For  the  ADDS  VIEWPOINT  60  terminal,  in  Half-Duplex mode,
        exiting  from the  insert mode  is by  striking the  INS C  key  on the
        keyboard.

             2. Unlock the keyboard.

                Normally  the  keyboard  is locked  when  any  transmit  key is
        struck.  A subsequent message  from the host will unlock  the keyboard.
        In some cases this may not happen. Then the operator may use  the RESET
        key to unlock the keyboard.  When the keyboard is considered  locked by
        CMT, the only entry from the terminal operator that will be accepted is

                                   4.6  FLDTAB (tab)


             The TAB  function moves the  cursor to the  beginning of  the next
        unprotected field. At the end of the screen, the cursor wraps around to
        the first unprotected field.

             This  function  is handled  locally  and CMT  updates  its current
        cursor position in the internal screen buffer.






                                4.7  BACKTA (back tab)


             The BACKTAB function moves the cursor backward to the beginning of
        an unprotected field. If the  cursor is already at the beginning  of an
        unprotected field, or if it  is in a protected field, the  cursor moves
        to the beginning of  the preceding unprotected field; at  the beginning
        of the screen, it wraps  around to the last unprotected field.   If the
        cursor is past the first position within an unprotected field, it moves
        to the beginning of the current field.

             This function is handled  locally by the terminal and  CMT updates
        its current cursor position in the internal screen buffer.






                              4.8  CURSEL (cursor select)


             The  CURSEL   function  allows   the  selector-light-pen-detection
        function to be performed from a keyboard.

             This function is invoked  by entering a control sequence  from the
        keyboard.

                           4.9  EEOF (erase to end of field)


             The  EEOF function  clears the  rest of  the field,  including the
        current  position,  if  the  cursor is  in  an  unprotected  field. The
        operation can wrap lines or the screen. The cursor does not  move.  The
        MDT bit is set.

             This function is handled  locally by the terminal and  CMT updates
        its internal screen buffer.






                                4.10  NEWLIN (new line)


             The  NEWLIN function  moves the  cursor to  the  first unprotected
        position on the  next line.  The cursor  may wrap the screen.  If there
        are  no unprotected  fields  on the  screen,  the cursor  will  move to
        character position 0; if there are no formatted fields, the cursor will
        be positioned at the first character on the next line.

             If this function can not be handled locally, it can be  invoked by
        entering a control sequence from keyboard.






                               4.11  REDSPY (redisplay)


             The REDSPY function clears the screen and redisplays  its contents
        as seen by  CMT.  The cursor is  moved to the first  unprotected field.
        If the screen is unformatted the cursor is moved to the  first position
        on the screen.

             This  function is  not  supported locally.  It can  be  invoked by
        entering a control sequence from the keyboard.

                               4.12  HOME (home cursor)


             The HOME function moves the  cursor to the beginning of  the first
        unprotected  field  on the  screen.  If the  cursor  is  already there,
        nothing happens.

             This function is handled  locally by the terminal and  CMT updates
        its cursor position accordingly.






                              4.13  INSMOD (insert mode)


             The  INSMOD  function  causes  CMT  to  enter  insert  mode.  Each
        character  typed  in  this  mode  is  inserted  at  the  current cursor
        position; data from  that position to the  end of the field  is shifted
        right one position, and the cursor moves right one position. The fields
        may wrap a line or the screen.

             This function is handled  locally by the terminal and  CMT updates
        the internal screen buffer.






                                 4.14  FCNF1 - FCNF24


             The application  program is  notified that  the function  has been
        requested. Areas of the screen that have been modified by  the operator
        are reported back to the application.

                                    4.16  ARROW KEY


             The  cursor  can  be  moved  in  the  up,  down,  right  and  left
        directions.  With these  four  keys, the  cursor  can be  moved  to any
        location on the screen.





                    4.16.1  CURSOR LEFT

             The CURLEFT function moves the cursor left one character position.
        At the left edge of a  line, the cursor wraps around to the  right edge
        of the previous line.

             This function is handled  locally by the terminal and  CMT updates
        its cursor position for the internal screen.





               4.16.2  CURSOR RIGHT

             The  CURRIGHT  function  moves  the  cursor  right  one  character
        position.  At the right edge of a line, the cursor wraps around  to the
        left edge at the next line.

             This function is handled  locally by the terminal and  CMT updates
        its cursor position for the internal screen.





                    4.16.3  CURSOR UP

             The CURUP function moves the  cursor up to the same column  in the
        line preceding the current line.  At the top of the screen,  the cursor
        wraps around to the bottom line.

             This function is handled  locally by the terminal and  CMT updates
        its cursor position for the internal screen.

                    4.16.4  CURSOR DOWN

             The CURDOWN function moves the  cursor down to the same  column in
        the line  following the  current line.   At bottom  of the  screen, the
        cursor wraps around to the top line.

             This function is handled  locally by the terminal and  CMT updates
        its cursor position for the internal screen.






                              4.17  FSYS (system request)


             In  the SNA  environment, the  SYSREQ function  performs  a switch
        procedure for SSCP-LU, LU-LU and the unowned session.  This key will be
        defined as a control sequence entered by the user from the keyboard.

             This key locks  the keyboard, clears the  screen, and waits  for a
        message from the host to unlock the keyboard.

             During  the  keyboard  lock,  if  for  any  reason,  the  SNA host
        interface does not respond, the RESET key can not unlock  the keyboard;
        only the KILL key is allowed to zap the circuit.

             In the BSC environment, the SYSREQ key is not allowed.






                         4.18  STATLN (status line selection)


             CMT has  a status line  which performs a  similar function  to the
        3270 status line.

             This function allows  the user to  enter the status  display, exit
        the status display, or select the status display area.

             The CMT status line (in Full-Duplex mode) indicates  the following
        conditions :

         *  1. Host interface type. (BSC/SNA/X.25)
           
         *  2. Session type. (APPL/SYS/?)

         *  3. CRT luname. (CRT: crt lu string)

         *  4. PRT luname. (PRT: prt lu string)

         *  5. Printer busy. (WAIT)

         *  6. Unavailable function was requested. (-F)

            7. Insert mode. (ISRT)

            8. Protected field. (PROT)

            9. Numeric lock. (NULK)

           10. Keyboard lock. (LOCK)


             In  Full-Duplex mode  operation, all  the above  status  items are
        displayed by the CMT  status line. In Half-Duplex mode  operation, some
        of them are displayed locally  by the terminal, therefore, it  need not
        be displayed  again by  CMT status line  in order  to avoid  the remote
        delay.

             * In Half-Duplex  mode, only status items  1 - 6 are  displayed on
        the CMT status  line, other status items  depend on the  terminal local
        status line.

             *  In Half-Duplex  mode, only  line  1 to  24 is  used  to display
        status.  No upper-corner, no 25th status line is displayed.

        For example, 

          1. With the ADDS VIEWPOINT 60 terminal in Half-Duplex mode 
             operation :
            
             a. Insert mode, locally displays "INSERT EOF".

             b. During keyboard lock, locally displays "KEYBOARD LOCK".
         
             c. Moving cursor into a protected field, locally displays
                "PROTECTED".
             
             d. No Numeric Lock.

          2. With the ADM 12 PLUS terminal in Half-Duplex mode operation :

             a. Insert mode, locally displays "INS".

             b. During keyboard lock, locally displays "KBLK".

             c. No protected field indication because cursor is not
                allowed to move to a protected field.

             d. No Numeric Lock.

             In Half-Duplex mode,  the status line automatically  displays, and
        defaults to the  24th line. It  will not be  turned off until  the user
        enters a control sequence to turn it off.

             In order  to keep  the terminal screen  data accurate,  before the
        status line is displayed, the keyboard is locked locally by  CMT. After
        the  status  line  display  is  complete,  the  keyboard   is  unlocked
        automatically.

             The whole status  line display area  is protected on  the terminal
        screen but not in the CMT internal screen buffer.

             With the ADDS VIEWPOINT 60 terminal, the cursor is allowed to move
        into this area, but the  ADM 12 PLUS terminal doesn't.   Both terminals
        will not allow data entered from the keyboard to destroy this area.

             If the status  line has an unprotected  field in the  CMT internal
        screen buffer, the only way to enter data in that area is to change the
        status line display to another line.

             No upper-right corner status display is allowed in the Half-Duplex
        mode operation.

                    5.2.1  FUNCTIONS PERFORMED LOCALLY

        1. Clear screen. (key 'SHIFT-CLEAR' with "PROT" mode reset)

        2. Cursor movement :

           Cursor up -    Moves the cursor up to the previous line in the same 
                          column. If the intended location is protected, the 
                          cursor will continue from right to left to the first 
                          unprotected location stopping at the Home position if
                          an unprotected location cannot be found.
           
           Cursor down -  Moves the cursor to the next line down in the same
                          column. If the intended location is protected, the 
                          cursor will move right to the first unprotected 
                          location.

           Cursor right - Moves the cursor to the right to the next unprotected
                          location. If the cursor is at the right margin, it 
                          moves down to the start of the next line until a
                          nonprotected location is found.

           Cursor left -  Moves the cursor to the left to the previous 
                          unprotected location. If the cursor is at the left 
                          margin, it moves up to the end of the previous line 
                          until a unprotected location is found.
           
           Tab - Works as normal. (key 'TAB')

           Backtab - Works as normal (key 'SHIFT-TAB')

        3. Delete character - It does not wrap a line. (key 'DELETE CHAR')

        4. Enter. (key 'RETURN')

        5. Insert mode - key 'INSERT MODE'.

        6. Keyboard lock. (CMT puts terminal in either lock or unlock)

        7. 32 PF keys.

        8. Erase input - erases all input characters, nothing changes in 
                         protected fields. (In "PROT" mode, key 'SHIFT-CLEAR')

        9. Typamatic - all alphameric, the cursor movement keys.

        10. New line. (key 'NEW LINE').

        11. Erase line - No EEOF key on terminal keyboard. In order to simulate
                         EEOF key, using erase line key to erase to end of 
                         line. If this field is more than one line, then erase 
                         line, move cursor to the next line, and do erase line 
                         again. (key 'ERASE LINE')

        12. Home - Moves the cursor to the first unprotected field.
         
        ** field attributes are not embedded (i.e. they do not occupy a
           character position on the screen).

        CMT  halfduplex  support.   This  specification  details  a   two  part
        function.  The complete terminal is  an input device to CMT  with local
        editing capabilities and  is an output  device for CMT.   This complete
        terminal used  the VT100  as a starting  point.  Changes  and additions
        from the VT100 are noted where described.

             This sequence determines what data may be enterred on  the screen.
        Defined area qualifications (DAQ)  do not occupy a  character position.
        More than one DAQ can be included in an unprotectd field.  The sequence
        affects the area between the current cursor position and the next DAQ.

             Note: this sequence is NOT supported by a VT100 terminal.



        5.3.1.2  Visual attributes
        The visual (or character) attributes are defined by the

        sequence:  ESC [ Ps;Ps;...;Ps m
        decimal:   27 91 xx 59 xx    109

        Where Ps refers to a selected parameter.  Multiple parameters
        are separated by the semicolon character (59 decimal).  The
        parameters are executed in order and have the following
        meanings:
