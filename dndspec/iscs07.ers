                                 1 -  CONSAT overview


             This document is  the External Reference Specification  for CONSAT
        (ISIS CONsolidated tymSAT) version 7.

             Major CONSAT changes after version 3.05 consist of the following:

        Version 4.00:  Added X.28 Packet Assembler/Disassembler (PAD) support.
                       Added HD202 support using line turnaround characters.
                       Deleted LISA voice terminal support.

        Version 4.01:  Added space parity terminal support.

        Version 4.02:  Added polarity key signalling TELEX support (SPEEDLINK).

        Version 4.03:  Added public OUTDIAL support.

        Version 5.00:  Added an extended DDT CONSAT operation monitor (COM).
                        - network console access is supported.
                        - port status and data in the Async rings, buffers,
                          and ISIS rings can be monitored by an operator
                          (access to the PDP-10 nib is not needed).
                       Added PCOWAT parameter for PVC.

        Version 6.01:  Added IIX dialect for S-mode terminal support.
                       Changed crash codes (see ERS appendices).
                        - Added crash codes for problem visibility.
                        - Renumbered duplicate crash codes.
                       Integrated the CONSAT and PAD.
                        - PAD mode ports and CONSAT mode ports can
                          co-exist in same slot as long as certain IIX
                          limitations are observed (see PAD restrictions).
                        - PAD supports only the PVC feature AID in X.28 PAD
                          command mode.
                        - PAD supports all PVC and MPVC features in CONSAT
                          login mode.
                        - PAD supports port addressibility in both CONSAT
                          login mode and X.28 PAD command mode.
                        - PAD now correctly supports all 1980 X.3 parameters.
                       Known PAD restrictions in version 6.01.
                        - PAD supports full-duplex ASCII devices, but not
                          half-duplex or non-ASCII devices.
                        - PAD supports Async ports, but not SIO ports.
                        - Pad command mode calls to IIX-capable, non-X.25
                          hosts are not supported.

        Version 6.02:  Included various bug fixes.  Please refer to X and Y
                       files for more detail information.

                       The non-shared accounting host number is reported to
                       the Supervisor as "SHUT" due to changes in the host
                       number processing by the Supervisor.
                       INACTIVITY macro is removed.  It's not implemented.
                       Corrected CRTID flag description, which does not
                       enable ODD or ENEV parity detection.

        Version 7.00:  Added the following new features:
                       - Both CONSAT & PAD support Logon Session II (LOGII)
                         protocol.
                       - PAD supports the 1984 CCITT X.3 parameters.
                       - CONSAT adds capability of restoring full duplex
                         from half duplex with control-E in login string.
                       - Adds CONSAT port usage information via XDDT.
                       Included various bug fixes. Please refer to the

                        2 -  Configuration and Code Generation


             Each  time  a CONSAT  is  generated,  a number  of  files  must be
        assembled together in  the proper order.   The particular set  of files
        used is environment dependent, but  a number of elements are  common to
        all environments.

             Generally,  the following  five files  should be  included  in the
        command  file  (NDxxxx.Css)  in  order  to  generate  a  CONSAT nibfile
        (NDxxxx.Nss):

                1.  Initialization file            (ISCSvv.Irr)
                2.  Configuration file             (NDxxxx.Tss)
                3.  CONSAT Source file             (ISCSvv.Rrr)
                4.  Patch file                     (ISCSvv.Prr)
                5.  File name for expected nibfile (NDxxxx.Nss)

                where:  xxxx  - node number
                        ss    - slot number
                        vv    - version number
                        rr    - revision level

             Sample files of each version can be found in two directories:

           o (SOURCE)filename   -- released CONSAT versions
           o (BETATEST)filename -- betatest CONSAT versions







                          2.1  Slot Command File - NDxxxx.Css


             This file is used to generate the nib file in one NAD command.

                                   ;x    NDxxxx.Css

             The following is an example of a betatest command file:

                         2.2  Initialization file - ISCSvv.Irr


             Through executing  the NAD command  to the above  NDxxxx.Css file,
        the  initialization  file  is  assembled  first.   It  performs general
        initialization and  its major function is to create a number  of Macros
        and symbolic parameters.   These Macros and  parmeters will be  used in
        the configuration option file (the NDxxxx.Tss file) later.

             These macros have some, but limited, ability to detect  syntax and
        gross configuration errors.  Thus  an additional process to  permit the
        verification   of   cross-referencing   options   is   necessary.   The
        verification process  is at the  first part of  the CONSAT  source file
        (ISCSvv.Rrr).   It  is performed  immediately  after  the configuration
        option  file is  assembled.  It  permits the  immediate  detection (and
        subsequent  repair) of  configuration errors  at the  beginning  of the
        generation  process.  So  a great  deal of  time will  not be  spent in
        fruitless effort.

                         2.3  Configuration File - NDxxxx.Tss


             The configuration file is the necessary file for a slot to specify
        the  environment,   parameters  and   particular  constraints   on  the
        configuration.   This  configuration  option file  is  also  called the
        Tymfile.  A sample Tymfile is introduced below before  the descriptions
        of the macros and parameters.

                         3 -  Configuration file - NDxxxx.Tss


             This section  contains the definition  and detail  information for
        the  configuration file.   The two  sample configuration  files  in the
        previous section can be used as good references.






                               3.1  Ranging Macro Syntax


             Several macros are of the general class of "Ranging  Macros" which
        have  similar  functions  and  invocation  form.   The  form  of  their
        parameters will be discussed here, and referenced wherever appropriate.

             Each ranging macro accepts a variable number of parameters  (up to
        16) and is  symbolically represented by MACRONAME(RANGE  1,...RANGE N).
        Each  of these  range parameters  is of  identical format,  and  may be
        specified in any desired order.  Null parameters are allowed,  and will
        be ignored.

             Each parameter specified may be of two forms: simple or range.

             A simple parameter consists  of a simple decimal  number, normally
        specifying a  particular port number  unless otherwise  declared.  This
        number must be a  valid port number.  Later exception  macro parameters
        are subject to the range defined in the DECLARE macro.

             A range parameter is of the form "N1-N2", where N1 and N2 are both
        decimal numbers, each subject  to the same constraints as  simple range
        parameters.  N2 must be greater  than N1; if not, a  diagnostic message
        is printed and the parameter ignored.

           Example:  RMACRO(1,2,3,6-8)


             This macro specifies the condition for ports 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8.
        The simpler way to define the same condition is RMACRO(1-3,6-8).

             Ranging macros may be  invoked repeatedly if necessary  to specify
        more than 16 parameters.

                               3.2  Text Argument Syntax


             Certain macros  specify that  an argument be  text.  This  text is
        subject to certain rules - some characters may not explicitly appear in
        the   text  string,   and  others   may  appear   only   under  certain
        circumstances.





                    3.2.1  Forbidden Characters

             The following characters may not appear; instead, these characters
        must be represented in an extended form:

                "8D     Carriage Return
                "8A     Line Feed
                "AF     slash ('/')
                "BA     colon (':')
                "BB     semicolon (';')

               NOTE:   While not forbidden, the NULL character  ("00) is
                       used  internally  to  signal the  end  of  a text
                       string.  Since text  beyond this point  cannot be
                       output, the use of NULL should be avoided.





                    3.2.2  Privileged Characters

             The  following characters  may appear  only if  escaped (preceeded
        with an accent grave '`').  These are:


            `   accent grave
            "   double quote
            ,   comma
            (   left parenthesis
            )   right parenthesis

                             3.3  General CONSAT features


             The following  collection of macros  are used to  declare specific
        capabilities for the general configuration.





                    3.3.1  Macro:  DECLARE(name,number)

             The first elements of the file must be configuration declarations.
        The DECLARE macro is used for this purpose.  NAME is selected  from the
        following list:


           ASYNC -      Async ports.
           SIO -        SIO ports.
           MPVC -       Multiplexed PVC ports.
           PRINT -      Printers.

             The  Macro  may  be  invoked  repeatedly,  once  for  each  set of
        configuration attributes.  However,  these must all be  declared BEFORE
        any  exception  macros  are  declared  (the  first  invocation  of  any
        exception macro  "fixes" the configuration;  thereafter, this  macro is
        invalid, and will generate a diagnostic!).

             NUMBER is a decimal number; it specifies the number of elements of
        the specified type.

                        SAMPLE USAGE:

                DECLARE(ASYNC,32)       :declare the configuration to
                                        :    contain 32d ASYNC ports

             CONSAT  has the  capability  of supporting  one or  more  than one
        remote high-speed printers.  The internal data structure is  limited to
        no more than 16 of  them.  The number of printer ports  declared cannot
        exceed the number of ASYNC ports either.

             These  printers  operate  using the  output  data  streams  of the
        lowest-numbered ASYNC ports, i.e. the first printer is on port  0.  The
        local operator, through execution of host programs, uses  the low-speed

                    3.3.2  Macro:  SHOWME(level)

             A configuration table  may be typed at  the end of  assembly.  The
        control of the contents is dependent on the LEVEL number requested.  If
        0,   no  table   is   printed.   Successively   larger   numbers  cause
        correspondingly greater quantities  of information (greater  detail) to
        be printed.

             If not specified, the default  value is 1.  This causes  the table
        to  contain minimal  information, such  as version  numbers  and device
        ranges.





                    3.3.3  Macro:  LOCATION(node,slot)

             Declares the target NODE and SLOT numbers.  Node is octal; Slot is
        decimal.   These values  are used  for identification  in  listings and
        configuration table.  The actual node and slot numbers used when loaded
        are provided externally by ISIS.





                    3.3.4  Macro:  ACHOST(number)

             Declares an origination-only host number NUMBER (decimal).

             This declaration is required!

             The last such declaration is the default used for all unsubscribed
        ports and is reported to the Supervisor with the status of  "SHUT".  If
        the accounting host number is shared by other function as a destination
        host  number,  the status  of  such  host number  is  governed  by that
        function, ie. OUTDIAL, or PAD with incoming call.

             Ports may  be subscribed  via the  use of  AHRNG, SHRNG,  or MHRNG
        macros, below.





                    3.3.5  Macro:  AHRNG(port range 1,...port range n)

             This ranging  macro subscribes  the ASYNC  ports specified  to the
        last ACHOST declaration value.

             This ranging macro subscribes the SIO ports specified to  the last
        ACHOST declaration value.





                    3.3.7  Macro:  MHRNG(port range 1,...port range n)

             This ranging macro subscribes the MPVC ports specified to the last
        ACHOST declaration value.





                    3.3.8  Macro:  LTEXT(TIDM,text string,D1,count,D2)

             This macro enables the user to specify that TID message to be sent
        at connect time.  The default TID message is 'please type your terminal
        identifier'.   Delays  can also  be  inserted into  this  message.  The
        duration of  the first delays  is set by  D1 and causes  a delay  of D1
        thirtieths  of  a second  between  sending the  first  COUNT  number of
        characters.  The remaining characters will  be sent with a delay  of D2
        thirtieths of a second.





                    3.3.9  Macro:  LTEXT(ULMSG,text string)

             This macro  enables the user  login message to  be sent  after the
        terminal type is identified.   Default is no message.  This  message is
        also called  the 1-down message,  and can be  downloaded to  the CONSAT
        from the network.





                    3.3.10  Macro:  NOBUSY(port range 1,...port range n)

             This ranging macro specifies an Async port or range of ports which
        are NOT to be  considered for BUSY-OUT control (e.g.   non-VADIC modems
        -- note that this function is automatically performed for HD202 ports).

                    3.3.11  Macro:  NO.CP(port range 1,...port range n)

             This ranging macro specifies an Async port or range of ports which
        are NOT to  be considered for Answer/hang  based on CP  control signals
        (Note that this function is automatically performed for HD202 ports).





                    3.3.12  Macro:  TID120(port range 1,...port range n)

             This ranging macro  specifies an Async port  or range of  ports to
        send the TID message to the  port at 1200 baud.  The default  for other
        ports is at 300 baud.

             Note:    In  order   to  avoid   problems  with   noise  detection
        capabilities in  some modems,  the message is  output at  a rate  of 10
        characters per second, but at either 300 or 1200 baud.





                    3.3.13  Macro:  TID240(port range 1,...port range n)

             This macro  has the same  function as TID120  except that  the TID
        message is sent to the port at 2400 baud.





                    3.3.14  Macro:  TID480(port range 1,...port range n)

             This macro  has the same  function as TID120  except that  the TID
        message is sent to the port at 4800 baud.

                    3.3.16  Macro:  TIDSPP(port range 1,...port range n)

             By default the TIDM message "please type your terminal identifier"
        is sent in even parity.   The macro TIDSPP allows the  selected port(s)
        to send the TIDM message in space (0) parity.  The parameter  syntax is
        identical to the usage of the TID120 macro.

             Example:    TIDSPP(0-3,8,11-15)

             Ports 0,1,2,3,8,11,12,13,14 and  15 will receive the  TIDM message
        with forced space parity.





                    3.3.17  Macro:  BFRSIZE(size)

             The BFRSIZE macro defines the bufferlet pool size in  decimal.  It
        overrides the  CONSAT default of  4096 bytes per  16 Async  ports.  The
        legal range is 4096 to 65536.





                    3.3.18  Macro:  ISISRING(size)

             The  ISISRING macro  defines the  ISIS input/output  ring  size in
        decimal.   It overrides  the CONSAT  default of  1024 bytes.   The size
        specified will include 4 bytes for fill pointer and empty pointer.





                    3.3.19  Macro:  ASYNCRING(size)

             The ASYNCRING  macro defines the  async input/output ring  size in
        decimal.   It  overrides the  CONSAT  default of  64  bytes.   The size
        specified  will include  6 bytes  for counter,  fill pointer  and empty
        pointer.  (Note:  Foreground overload  can cause the async  input rings
        to wrap;  increasing the  async ring size  provides more  buffering and
        more tolerance for transient foreground overload caused by peak traffic
        loads.)

                    3.3.20  Macro:  SIOBUF(count)

             The SIOBUF macro defines the  number of SIO input buffers  in hex.
        It overrides the Consat default of 10 hex input buffers.  The  macro is
        rarely used since the default supports traffic at speeds up to 9600 bps
        without data  loss.  A larger  value uses more  memory but  provides no
        advantage, while a  lower value conserves  memory but allows  data loss
        under peak traffic loads.





                    3.3.21  Macro:  LGTIMR(count)

             This  macro  takes  effects only  in  the  LOGII  environment.  It
        defines  a login inactivity timeout counter.  The "count" is  a decimal
        value that:

           count = 0   ---> the inactivity timeout routine is disabled
           count > 127 ---> warning message is displayed at assembly time:

           %>>> WARNING *** LGTIMR value too big, changed to default

           0 < count , 128  ---> login timeout in (count * 15) seconds


             The login timeout routine is called every 15 seconds.  The default
        8 times would allow user 2 minutes to login before been timed out.


             If timeout occurs, the following message is displayed and user has
        to reboot the terminal for another login.

                      "please see your representative, if
                          you have trouble logging in" 


             Addressable ports are not affected by this macro.





                    3.3.22  Macro:  ESCSTP(count)

             This  macro  takes  effects only  in  the  LOGII  environment.  It
        defines the maximum number of ESCape/<CR> key strokes (default 5)  that
        the user can enter at the initial login stage.  The "count" which  is a
        decimal  value greater  than 0  and less  than 128.   When  an internal
        counter in CONSAT reaches this limit, the port will be disconnected and
        the following message displayed:

                    3.3.23  Macro:  PADRELatedfunctions(switch)

             This macro enables  the CONSAT/PAD functions.   These capabilities
        include control of the full X.3 set of terminal parameters,  support of
        the  X.28  terminal protocol,  and  the ability  of  the  CONSAT/PAD to
        communicate with X.25/X.75 interfaces in packet mode.  This  macro will
        be introduced in the CONSAT/PAD macro section again since it  is really
        a CONSAT/PAD macro.





                    3.3.24  Macro:  DEFOADR(string)

             This  macro  takes  effects only  in  the  LOGII  environment.  It
        defines the default Origination Address for the slot.

             OADR  is sent  to the  Supervisor in  the circuit  request  by the
        CONSAT.  If MYOADR is not defined for the port requesting  the circuit,
        the "string" defined in  this macro is used  in the OADR field  for the
        Supervisor.

             The  "string" can  be entered  in the  form of  "-<DNIC><NTN>" for
        X.121 addressing format, or as  "username string" for  regular Tymnet's
        username format.

             This OADR will be used by the Supervisor as the user name if it is
        not  entered by  the user,  and  is subject  to the  validation  by the
        Supervisor.  It is also used as the CALLING ADDRESS by  the destination
        interface, ie. X.25 or PAD with incoming call capability.

             If this macro is not  defined, the OADR will be determined  by the
        macro MYOADR.  If  both are not defined,  the CONSAT will not  send any
        OADR to the Supervisor.

             The length of  the OADR also affects  the decision of  whether the
        OADR will be sent to the Superviosr:

           1. OADR length is longer than 60 bytes. The following
              message will be displayed by the CONSAT:

              >>> WARNING *** DEFOADR longer than 60 bytes not generated!

                  generated for X.121 address!






                    3.3.25  Macro:  MYOADR(string,p0,p1,p2,...,p12,p13,p14)

             This  macro  takes  effects in  the  LOGII  environment  only.  It
        defines the Origination Address that  is sent to the Supervisor  in the
        circuit request.

             The first argument, string, defines the OADR to be sent out  as is
        in the circuit request.  This string  can be defined in the form  of "-
        <DNIC><NTN>" or in the form of "username".

             The second and the rest  of the arguments, up to 15  arguments are
        allowed, associate the "string" with  the ports that CONSAT is  to send
        out as the  OADR.  The port arguments  can be port ranges  in ascending
        order.

             If this macro is not  specified, the default OADR will be  used in
        the  circuit request.   If  both the  DEFOADR  and the  MYOADR  are not
        defined, the CONSAT will not send any OADR to the Supervisor.

             The OADR  is used by  the Supervisor, in  the absence of  the user
        name field, as the user name and is subject to the validation process.

             This OADR  is also used  as a CALLING  ADDRESS by  the destination
        interface, ie. X.25 or PAD with incoming call capability.

        Example :

        MYOADR(-31060123456789,0-4,10-20,22,23)
        MYOADR(MVS1,0-31)


             The length of  the OADR also affects  the decision of  whether the
        OADR will be sent to the Superviosr:

           1. OADR length is longer than 60 bytes. The following
              message will be displayed by the CONSAT:

              >>> WARNING *** MYOADR longer than 60 bytes not generated!

                    3.3.26  Macro:  SETFLAG(flagname, on/off or 0/1)

             This macro sets  tymfile flags on or  off.  Such flags  are OMRON,
        YTID, KANA,  CRTID, AEQCR,  SLODTR, SKXOFF,  LOGII, XPRADR,  MX.ACC and
        X32584.  AEQCR, CRTID, XPRADR, and X32584 are PAD flags, therefore more
        details  on  them  can  be  found  in  the  CONSAT/PAD  macro  section.
        SETFLAG(YTID,0)  and  SETFLAG(YTID,OFF)  are the  same  as  YTID  EQ 0.
        However,  user  should always  define  the flags  using  SETFLAG macros
        instead of using the equate statement.



        3.3.26.1  Flag SLODTR

             The SLODTR flag overrides  the default to require four  seconds of
        carrier before answering the port instead of two seconds.



        3.3.26.2  Flag YTID

             The YTID flag changes the CCT of a point of sale (POS) transaction
        terminal with a tid of 'Y' to 01 from 25.



        3.3.26.3  Flag KANA

             The KANA flag  disables O as a  TID character and redefines  the I
        TID character as selecting space parity.



        3.3.26.4  Flag OMRON

             The OMRON  flag is  used for OMRON  terminals.  This  prevents the
        message  defined  by   LTEXT(ULMSG,text)  from  being  sent   to  OMRON
        terminals.



        3.3.26.5  Flag TRANHX

             The TRANHX flag allows extended DDT to present hex data as well as
        the corresponding ASCII character.  If this flag is not set or  is OFF,
        only the hex data will be presented.

        3.3.26.6  Flag LOGII

             The LOGII flag (default ON) can be used to disable the LOGII logon
        session protocol in the CONSAT slot when setting it to OFF.   When only

        3.3.26.7  Flag MX.ACC

             The MX.ACC  flag, when turned  on, provides general  statistics on
        CONSAT port usage  via XDDT.  The statistics  for CONSAT Port  Usage is
        based on the  number of Async  ports that have  been in use  during the
        past 24  hours.  Default  of this flag  is OFF.   See the  "DDT Control
        Features" in the Appendices for detailed description and sample.



        3.3.26.8  Flag SKXOFF

             The  SKXOFF flag  allows CONSAT  to ignore  the  XOFF character(s)
        after the first XOFF character  is received.  When an XON  character is
        received, the normal XON/XOFF handling will be resumed.

                         3.4  Specialized Terminals and Modems


             CONSAT  supports a  number of  specialized terminals,  modems, and
        terminal protocols.  Certain handlers are not assembled unless invoked.
        The  invocation  of  the  appropriate  handlers  is  performed  by  the
        following macros:





                    3.4.1  Halfduplex 202 modem support

             Bell 202S half-duplex modems are supported.



        3.4.1.1  Macro:  HD202(port range 1,...port range n)

             This  ranging macro  specifies  an Async  port or  range  of ports
        assigned to  Bell 202S  half-duplex modems.  It automatically  sets the
        specified ports as per NOBUSY option.

             NOTE:  As of  version 4.00, this is  not a generic  HD202 support,
        but a specific protocol using line turn around characters.





                    3.4.2  BAUDOT terminals

             These terminals are  supported - both on  ASYNC and SIO  drivers -
        but are invoked using the PVC/AID mechanism.  Support is  available for
        both transparent usage, and translate-to-ASCII (default) mode.   In the
        translate-to-ASCII mode, the CCITT standard is used, with the following
        special translations:

                BAUDOT  ASCII

                  WRU    ENQ
                 NO. 6    $
                 NO. 7    #
                 NO. 8    &


             See the PVC section for usage.

               NOTE:   PVC options,  PAR, HDX,  NOCRLF, NOLFCR,  are not
                       supported  by  BAUDOT terminal  handler.   Use of
                       these options will cause assembly errors.

        3.4.2.1  Macro:  BAUDQS(port range 1,...port range n)

             This ranging macro specifies an  Async port or range of  ports for
        virtual  telex,  which  supports  untranslatable  characters  (ASCII to
        BAUDOT) sent as a Baudot question mark (?)  instead of  discarding them
        and specific characters expanded to text strings (# to NBR, % to O/O, &
        to AND, $ to DLR).  NOTE:   This macro is used only for TID34  & TID35,
        and does not apply to SIO.

             Split speed  75/1200 baud videotext  terminals are  supported, but
        are  invoked using  the  PVC/AID mechanism.   See the  PVC  section for
        usage.   Both transparent  and translate-to-ASCII  are  supported.  The
        following special keys are mapped in the translate-to-ASCII mode.

                  KEY   ASCII

                             4 -  LOGII - Logon Session II


             LOGII  is  a protocol  which  redefines the  Tymnet  logon session
        mechanism.  Users in the  CONSAT environment perform the  login process
        governed by the ADRII login syntax.  CONSAT is defaulted to support the
        LOGII logins.  However, users who do not want to utilize the  new login
        syntax, can still login as they used to do.


             If the new CONSAT resides in a node without the  LOGII capability,
        and the  CONSAT is configured  to support the  new LOGII  features, the
        CONSAT slot will not be able to build any circuit.  This is due  to the
        incompatibility of the communications  between the CONSAT slot  and the
        ISIS and Node Code.  For this environment, either the CONSAT  slot must
        be downgraded to the earlier version, or the whole node is  upgraded to
        the most  current versions  with LOGII capability.   The Node  Code and
        ISIS  must  be  LOGII  to enable  the  use  of  LOGII  protocol between
        themselves and the CONSAT slot.


             When a node has the Node Code and ISIS both support  LOGII logins,
        it is  called a LOGII  node.  A  LOGII CONSAT resides  in a  LOGII node
        will send  login  string in the LOGI  format, when it detects  that the
        Supervisor  is  a  LOGI Supervisor.   In  this  situation,  whether the
        circuit will be built depends on if the login string is accepted by the
        LOGI Supervisor.






                                4.1  Design Constraints


             Due  to   the  time   constraints,  the   phase  1   LOGII  CONSAT
        implementation provides only the following functions:

          1. Non-SIO PAD, defined by 1980 CCITT X.3 parameters.
          2. Regular CONSAT connections under ASYNC or SIO.
          3. OUTDIAL.
          4. Addressable Ports.
          5. Other restrictions specified in this document.


             TELEX and PVC mechansims are only supported in LOGI.

                             4.2  New CONSAT Login Syntax


             The detailed descriptions  of the new  login syntax is  defined in
        the ADRII.GED document.  The login syntax description provided below is
        for quick reference only.

        New ADRII Login Syntax:
        -----------------------


         [ option ] [ user  ] [ destination ] [ extension ] [ password ]
         [ field  ] [ field ] [    list     ] [   field   ] [   field  ]


             The  new  login process  does  not preclude  the  old  style login
        syntax.   Users  can  still logon  to  the  destination  host interface
        without using the new login syntax.

             The  extension field  is  not interpreted  by the  CONSAT,  and is
        passed on to the Supervisor.   The extension field can be used  to pass
        user data to the destination interface.

             The extension field does not exist if the user tries to  login via
        the X.28  login process provided  by the PAD.   However, the  Call User
        Data Block can be used to send user data to the destination interface.





                    4.2.1  OPTION FIELD

             The option  field consists  of control  characters allowed  in the
        existing  login  process,  and  the  option  enclosed  by  parentheses.
        Multiple options are separated by a comma(,).

             The option field items include the following:

                TCLass=A                Throughput class(Same as Control A)

                    4.2.2  USER FIELD

             This is the field where the user puts in the user name.  Two types
        of user name formats are allowed:

           o  Regular Usrename
           o  X.121 Username




        4.2.2.1  Regular Username

             Regular  usernames  must  begin with  a  letter,  digit, asterisk,
        pound-sign, or dollar-sign. It can have total from 0 - 20 characters.

             For example: JSMITH.



        4.2.2.2  X.121 Username

             The X.121 usernames consist  of a dash, a Data  Network Identifier
        Code (DNIC) and a Network Terminal Number (NTN).  The DNIC  consists of
        exactly  four decimal  digits,  and the  NTN  consists of  zero  to ten
        decimal digits.  To aid  readability, X.121 usernames can  also include
        parentheses, dashes, pluses, minuses, and blanks.  However, they cannot
        precede the initial dash, nor appear within the DNIC.





                    4.2.3  DESTINATION LIST

             The destination  list may  consist up  to two  destination fields.
        The  destination field  indicates the  requested  destination interface
        address.  This address can be  a gateway or the final  destination host
        interface.

             The following examples show some possible combinations:

                username:BUBB:1234;password     or

                username:1234;password


             Each destination field starts with a colon(:), and is  followed by
        one of the following entries.

                HOST-NUMBER.SUBHOST
                  This is a host number (0 to 5 decimal digits)
                  followed by a period and then followed by a

                  subhost number (0 to 4 decimal digits).
                  Multiple entries can be entered, separated by
                  a comma (,).

                *
                  This is a login request to the active Supervisor.

                %NODE-NUMBER
                  This address requests a circuit to the node number
                  entered, and will be connected to the DDT process.
                  This is used in place of a kernel host number.

                HOST-NAME
                  This address begins with a letter to indicate a name
                  is being entered.  The second character and after can
                  be another letter or digit or punctuation. The 
                  HOST-NAME can have up to 20 characters.

                - RPOA
                  This is the Recognized Private Operating Agency.

                - DNIC NTN
                  This format indicates that X.121 addressing is used.
                  DNIC is a 4-digit number, and NTN is a 10-digit number.






                    4.2.4  EXTENSION FIELD

             This field is enclosed by brackets([ ]).  Format of this  field is
        undefined.

             If it is entered, it will not be examined by the CONSAT,  and will
        be passed on directly to the Supervisor.





                    4.2.5  PASSWORD FIELD

             This field  is used if  the username requires  a password  for the
        network Supervisor to complete the login process.

             These functions are common to all PVC usage; functions specialized
        to specific devices are described in succeeding sections.





                    5.1.1  Macro:  PTEXT(message number,text string)

             The default standard PVC messages are:

             msg no.    text
             ------     ----

                1       'circuit building in progress'

                4       'ALO password configuration error'
                5       'ALO login string configuration error'
                6       'Circuit lost - will try later'

             This macro allows the  user to override the default  PVC messages.
        "Message number" specifies which of  the six default messages is  to be
        replaced.  The "text  string" must adhere  to the syntax  described for
        text arguments.

             Messages 3, 4,  and 5 only  apply to ports  that have ALO  set on.
        They indicate an  error in the configuration  of STEXT or UTEXT,  or in
        the validation of the generated username and password, and should never
        be encountered.

                    5.1.2  Macro:  UTEXT(login text string)

             This  macro allows  a user  to override  the ALO  generation  of a
        username and password  based on a node  and port number, and  defines a
        replacement login text string.   The replacement string may be  used by
        all ALO ports, or may,  by repetition of the statement,  specify unique
        login strings for selected ports.   If single ports or groups  of ports
        are  to have  different login  strings, each  UTEXT definition  must be
        followed immediately by a UTXRNG (or SUTXRG, for SIO)  statement, which
        specifies the ports using the corresponding login string.  The  text of
        the  login  string  must  adhere  to  the  syntax  described  for  text
        arguments.

             If the UTEXT option is  invoked, the rest of ports  not explicitly
        assigned by  the use of  the UTXRNG (or  SUTXRG) macro still  use login
        strings  (username  and  password) generated  based  on  node  and port
        numbers, and optional security characters.

               NOTE:   Multiple  UTEXT  entries  are  expensive  in core
                       requirements.





                    5.1.3  Macro:  PCOPAR(pco parameter,seconds)

             This macro is  used to set seconds  in decimal for  PCO parameters
        such as PCWAIT, TRYDELAY and RETRYDELAY.  For example:

        PCOPAR(PCWAIT,20)       : same as PCOWAT EQ 20, default 0 seconds
        PCOPAR(TRYDEL,40)       : same as PCOTRY EQ 40, default 90 seconds
        PCOPAR(RETRYD,30)       : same as PCORTY EQ 30, default 90 seconds

             The configuration  equate parameters,  PCOWAT, PCOTRY  and PCORTY,
        control the time delays in the rebuilding of a PCO circuit.

             When a PCO port is initialized, it attempts to log in to  the host
        it is configured for.  One of three things may happen:

          1.  The circuit can be successfully built by the Supervisor
              and accepted by the host;

          2.  The circuit may not be built due to lack of Supervisor
              connection or host unavailability, and therefore the 
              port would remain in login mode; or

          3.  The circuit can be successfully built to the host by the
              Supervisor, but then zapped or hung (if 'NOHNG' is set)
              by the host.


             PCOWAT, PCOTRY and PCORTY only apply to case 3 above.   The number
        of  elasped seconds  is specified  in decimal.   These  parameters only
        apply if ALO has been set ON for the port.

           o  PCOWAT - default 0, maximum 7200 seconds.
           o  PCOTRY - default 90 seconds, range 32 - 7200 seconds.
           o  PCORTY - default 90 seconds, range 32 - 7200 seconds.


             PCOWAT  -- Seconds  to wait before  another login attempt  will be
        made and before the 'circuit lost - rebuilding' message is sent  out to
        the users.

             PCOTRY  -- If, upon this second login attempt, the circuit  to the
        host is  completed, and  the circuit is  zapped (or  hung) by  the host
        again.  PCO control routine to test if the previous circuit has been up
        PCOTRY seconds.  If yes, then wait PCOWAT seconds to rebuild a circuit;

             PCORTY -- if no, then wait PCORTY seconds to rebuild a circuit.


        PCO Parameter Usage Explanation

              Ninety seconds after a login attempt is made, the code  checks to
        see if the port is still in login mode (i.e., the circuit has  not been
        built), if so, zaps the circuit and attempts to rebuild.

             If a circuit to the  host is completed, and the circuit  is zapped
        by the host,(or hung if 'NOHNG' is set), another login attempt  is made
        immediately  if PCOWAT  (default  0) is  not specified.   If  PCOWAT is
        defined, then the specified number of seconds is waited  before another
        is made.  Users  will see message (  circuit lost -  rebuilding) before
        the login attemp is made for either case.

             If, upon  this second login  attempt, the circuit  to the  host is
        completed and  then zapped (or  hung) by the  host, the  following will
        occur:

          1.  If more than PCOTRY seconds had elapsed since the login string
              was sent, another login will be attempted after PCOWAT seconds.

          2.  If fewer than PCOTRY seconds had elapsed, the following
              message is sent to the terminal (unless redefined by <PTEXT>):

                      circuit lost...will try later

              Another login attempt will be delayed until PCORTY seconds
              seconds have elapsed.  At that time, the message

                      circuit building in progress

              will be sent to the user (unless redefined by <PTEXT>).

             Any subsequent login attempts for PCO ports will be tempered  by a
        determination of whether or not  the previous circuit had been  up long
        enough to be  considered stable, i.e.,  up longer than  PCOTRY seconds.
        It should  be noted  that the  parameter PCOTRY  is the  same parameter
        which determined the delay for subsequent login attempts if the port is
        zapped  (or hung)  while in  login mode.   This includes  the situation
        where the  port is zapped  by the  node itself if  the port  remains in
        login mode for more than 90 seconds.

                       additional macros are defined to provide the same
                       functionality for  SIO ports, to  avoid requiring
                       knowledge   of   the   internal   port-assignment
                       structure.

             The first  two macros  are required  only if  PVC ASYNC  ports are
        defined which are not declared using the PVCEX macro.





                    5.2.1  Macro:  PVCRNG(port range 1,...port range n)

             This ranging macro defines  the range of default PVC  ASYNC ports.
        All ports which require default PVC services must be included.

                    5.2.2  Macro:  PVCDF(option 1,...option n)

             This macro  defines the  default parameters  for ASYNC  PVC ports.
        Parameter values may be any valid combination of the  options described
        in the PVC  Parameters section of  this document.  Those  options which
        are mutually exclusive are so indicated.

             The default options (those used if not specified) are:

                NOAID   NPI     NOALO   NOPCO   NOSLO
                NOPAR   NOHDX   CRLF    LFCR    NORBP

                WRU     NOSPAR  NOKAT   NOUPC   NORCV
                NOPRB 

             Every ASYNC port specified by the PVCRNG macro which does not have
        an explicit  option assignment  using the PVCEX  macro will  default to
        those options specified by this macro.  If neither option of  an option
        pair is specified for a port by PVCDF or PVCEX, the port will  have the
        default option.





                    5.2.3  Macro:  PVCEX(port range,option1,...optionx)

             If  PVCEX  is  not  specified, all  ASYNC  ports  will  assume the
        defaults specified in PVCDF.

             This macro defines PVC  options for a (single) specified  range of
        port numbers.  The options are entered as in the PVCDF statement.  This
        statement  overrides  the  defaults set  by  PVCDF.   The  port numbers
        specified must have been declared by PVCRNG.





                    5.2.4  Macro:  STEXT(text string)

             Default -- no  security sequence will  be appended to  the default
        password unless this macro is invoked.

             This  macro allows  the user  to define  a security  sequence text
        string.   This string  (up to  4 characters)  will be  appended  to the
        generated  password for  ALO ports.   The characters  must be  valid as
        password characters.

                    5.2.5  Macro:  UTXRNG(port range 1,...port range n)

             This  ranging macro  can be  declared only  if a  UTEXT  string is
        declared.   It  specifies the  ALO  ports which  use  the  login string
        specified by the UTEXT macro immediately preceding this statement.






                                     5.3  SIO PVC


             In  order to  avoid a  need to  explicitly bias  the  port numbers
        specified  for  SIO  PVC   ports,  different  macros  are   defined  to
        automatically perform this port-relocation.





                    5.3.1  Macro:  SPVRNG(port range 1,...port range n)

             This macro defines the range  of SIO PVC ports.  Port  numbers are
        specified in decimal.  This macro, like PVCRNG, may be repeated as many
        times as necessary to define all SIO PVC ports.





                    5.3.2  Macro:  SPVCEX(port range 1,...port range n)

             Like PVCEX, except that the port number range specified applies to
        SIO ports only, and must have been declared by SPVRNG.

               NOTE:   ALL SIO PVC ports must be specified using SPVCEX!





                    5.3.3  Macro:  SUTXRG(port range 1,...port range n)

             Like UTXRNG, except that the port number specified applies  to SIO
        ports only.

                                  5.4  PVC Parameters


             PVC parameter values (used for PVCDF and PVCEX macros) may  be any
        valid combination of the options described below.  Those  options which
        are  mutually exclusive  are  indicated.  Parameter  defaults  are also
        indicated.





                    5.4.1  NPI/NONPI

             NPI prints the node/port identifier for AID ports (default).

             NONPI disables printing of the node/port identifier.





                    5.4.2  TXT/NOTXT

             TXT permits text to be output to ports (default).

             NOTXT  disables  printing  of  text  (includes  NONPI,  i.  e.  no
        node/port  identifier will be output), but is limited to text generated
        by the node.





                    5.4.3  MPC/NOMPC

             MPC (Multiplexed PVC Candidate) specifies that this port is  to be
        considered  a  candidate  for  MPVC.  That  is,  the  username  will be
        examined  to determine  if this  port qualifies  for MPVC  service.  If
        username  does not  pass  exam, this  port  is not  qualified  for MPVC
        service  and  is treated  as  PVC candidate.   This  option  is ignored
        (without  comment)  if  MPVC  is not  enabled  in  a  particular CONSAT
        environment.

             NOMPC  specifies  that  this  port  is  not  automatically  a MPVC
        candidate.  That is, the username  will not be examined.  But  the port
        may become a  MPVC candidate dependent upon  TID usage, for  example, Y
        TID or TID14).  (default)

                    5.4.4  AID/NOAID

             The AID (Automatic  IDentification) option specifies that  as soon
        as a port becomes physically connected, the CONSAT handles the  port as
        if the TID prompt had been sent, and an appropriate character received.
        Once defined as an AID port,  the port is not available to  service any
        terminal types other than the one specified.

             AID sets automatic  terminal identification.  It must  be followed
        in the  option list  by a  TID type.  The  TID type  may be  applied to
        either ASYNC or <SIO>.  Those supported for SIO are flagged "OK" in the
        SIO column.  SIO  ports have no autospeed  detection; the speed  is set
        via a switch on the SIO card.  TID8, TID9, TID31, TID32,  TID33, TID34,
        TID35, TID36, TID37, and TID38  have no character TID for  selection by
        the terminal user; the AID option must be set.

             NOAID disables automatic terminal identification (default).

                    5.4.5  ALO/NOALO

             ALO (Automatic Login Option) specifies  that as soon as a  port is
        connected, and terminal identification is supplied (either by the user,
        or,  if enabled,  by  the AID  option), the  CONSAT  will automatically
        generate a username and password.  The user is not prompted  to 'please
        log in:', and does not have the option of specifying an  alternate host
        number initially.  Instead of the 'please log in:'  prompt,  the CONSAT
        sends the message 'circuit building in progress'.  Nothing else will be
        sent to the terminal until the host sends its greeting message.  If the
        log  in  is  not  successful  ,  a  message  such  as  'circuit  lost -
        rebuilding' , or 'circuit lost - will try again later' will be  sent to
        the terminal.

             If ALO  is specified, either  PCO or SLO  must also  be specified.
        NOALO  specifies  that  no automatic  login  string  will  be generated
        (default).

             The following paragraph describes  the format used to  generate an
        automatic login string.

             When  the  ALO  option  is  specified,  the  default  username and
        password generated by the CONSAT are based on the originating  node and
        port numbers.  The format is as follows:

              XXnnnnppppYY;Pppppnnnnssss <CR>

              where   XX = literally the letters 'XX'
                    nnnn = node number (in octal)
                    pppp = port number on the CONSAT (in octal).  The first
                           digit specifies the slot number.
                      YY = literally the letters 'YY'  
                       P = literally the letter 'P' 
                    ssss = zero to  four character  security sequence  
                           supplied by the user at system generation
                           time (see Section 3.2.4)


             XXnnnnppppYY  is  the  generated  user  name.   The  semicolon (;)
        terminates the user name and indicates login to the default destination
        host.  Pppppnnnnssss is the generated password, and is terminated  by a
        carriage return.  The generated username and password with  an optional
        security sequence must be validated on the Supervisor.

                    5.4.6  PCO/NOPCO

             PCO  (Permanent Circuit  Option)  specifies that  the  CONSAT will
        attempt to rebuild a  circuit to the home  host if the circuit  is lost
        and  the  port  remains   connected.   The  message  'circuit   lost  -
        rebuilding' is sent to the terminal, and the generated login  string is
        sent to the network as was done when the port was initially connected.

             If the login attempt fails (for example, if the host system or the
        TYMCOM is down), a new  login string will be sent automatically  to the
        network at  intervals specified by  PCOTRY/PCORTY until the  circuit is
        re-established, as long as the port remains connected.

             The PCO user should be aware that forgetting to turn  the terminal
        off,  thereby  leaving  the port  connected,  will  cause  connect time
        charges  to  accrue,  since  the CONSAT  will  continue  trying  to re-
        establish a circuit for a connected port that has PCO set on.

             NOPCO specifies no permanent circuit (default).

             The options PCO and SLO are mutually exclusive, but one of the two
        must be specified if the ALO option has been set.





                    5.4.7  SLO/NOSLO

             SLO (Subsequent Login Option) specifies that a user has the choice
        of logging onto  the home host or  an alternate host when  his original
        circuit is lost.  When the CONSAT detects that a PVC port  circuit with
        SLO ON  has been lost,  it sends  the 'please log  in:'  prompt  to the
        terminal.  The user may choose any of the three following responses:

               1.  --  Disconnect the terminal.  If AID is specified for
                       this  port,  the  user  need  only  reconnect the
                       terminal, and a new circuit will be built  to the
                       home host.

               2.  --  Log in to  an alternate host, using  the standard
                       network format.

               3.  --  Specify  a new  circuit  (to the  home  host), by
                       entering:

                                  :L(carriage return)
                                       -- or --
                                :L:HH(carriage return)

               NOTE -  The colon puts the user in control mode,  and the
                       L(carriage return) directs the CONSAT  to rebuild
                       the circuit to the home host.

               NOTE -  Using  the  second  form,  the  user  is  able to
                       specify  explicitly  an  alternate   host  number
                       ('HH', in decimal) to which the circuit is  to be
                       directed.   This  mode  applies  ONLY  to default
                       username/password usage  -- for ports  which have
                       specified  an  alternate  login  string  (via the
                       UTEXT  Macro),  ':L'  (with   no  carriage-return
                       needed) is the only available option.

             NOSLO specifies no subsequent  login to an alternate host  will be
        allowed (default).

             Option SLO and PCO are mutually exclusive.





                    5.4.8  PAR/NOPAR

             PAR sets even parity.

             NOPAR sets no parity, 8-bit data (default).

               NOTE:    Carriedg over from the history of the CONSAT and
                       network, actual parity at the  terminal interface
                       is ambiguous during login.  If NOPAR is  set, the
                       terminal  identifier  message (TIDM)  is  sent in
                       even parity.  Whereas network originated messages
                       will have mark parity.





                    5.4.9  HNG/NOHNG

             HNG specifies the CONSAT will hang up (disconnect) a port when one
        of the following two conditions occurs:

            o  if the <TID> is not entered within 16 to 32 seconds
               following the 'please type your terminal identifier' prompt.

            o  when the network sends a hang signal following the
              'Please see your representative' message (default).


             NOHNG allows an infinite TID timer. This prevents the  CONSAT from
        hanging a port when a  hang character pair is transmitted.   NOHNG also
        converts a hang signal to a zap signal.

                    5.4.10  DSC/NODSC

             DSC specifies  the CONSAT will  hang up a  port if the  circuit is
        Zapped.  This parameter overrides NOHNG, PCO, and SLO.

             NODSC prevents the CONSAT from hanging a port when the  circuit is
        zapped (default).





                    5.4.11  HDX/NOHDX

             HDX  simulates half  duplex handling  (e.g., no  character echoing
        except for CR/LF pairs).

             NOHDX specifies no half duplex handling (default).

               NOTE:   This  is a  simulation of  half  duplex involving
                       echo handling, and  does not support  actual half
                       duplex devices.





                    5.4.12  CRLF/NOCRLF

             CRLF specifies a carriage return will be echoed with  the linefeed
        when a linefeed is entered at the terminal (default).

             NOCRLF specifies  a carriage  return will not  be echoed  with the
        linefeed.





                    5.4.13  LFCR/NOLFCR

             LFCR specifies a linefeed will be echoed with the  carriage return
        when a carriage return is entered at the terminal (default).

                    5.4.14  RBP/NORBP

             RBP  specifies  reverse  backpressure  capability  (e.g., terminal
        control of character flow as  would occur if a Control-R  were imbedded
        in the login string).

             NORBP specifies no reverse backpressure capability (default).





                    5.4.15  WRU/NOWRU

              These  two  options are  specifically  for TID34  and  TID35 type
        ports. WRU option  controls the exchange  between the TELEX  device and
        the CONSAT prior to a successful  login.  If WRU is defined in  the PVC
        exception, and the ABACK (answerback) macro defines an answerback text.
        This text will  be sent in response  to WRU characters received  from a
        TELEX device connected to TID34 or TID35 type ports (default).   If WRU
        is  defined in the PVC  exception, but the ABACK macro is  not defined,
        no text will  be sent, but users can still login.

             NOWRU specifies no WRU characters received from a TELEX device.





                    5.4.16  SPAR/NOSPAR

             The option SPAR specifies all  data to the terminal are  forced to
        space (0) parity.

             NOSPAR  specifies  all data  to  the  terminal to  be  8  bit data
        (default).





                    5.4.17  KAT/NOKAT

             The option KAT specifies that the CONSAT will support  Katakana on
        PVC circuit.  Enter control K  in login mode ("please log  in:"  banner
        sent to terminals) will also support Katakana on non-PVC ports.

             NOKAT specifies  that the  CONSAT port  will not  support Katakana
        (default).

                    5.4.19  RCV/NORCV

             The option RCV limit  addressable ports to "receive  only" status.
        For these ports, only circuits originated from the network are allowed;
        the device connected to these ports can not initiate a login.

             NORCV does  not limit addressable  ports to "receive  only" status
        (default).





                    5.4.20  PROBE/NOPRB

             The  option PROBE  is  defined to  desire the  message  of network
        circuit completion or zap indicated on the Probe.

             NOPRB specifies that no  message of network circuit  completion or

                                 6 -  Multiplexed PVC


             The objective of MPVC  is to eliminate the circuit-build  time and
        effort  for   transaction-oriented  terminals-  characterized  by short
        sessions and low volume  traffic.  This elimination both speeds  up the
        response,  and reduces  the  port tie-up  time for  each  session.  The
        mechanism  employed  involves  routing the  ports  to  MPVC  within the
        CONSAT.

             For detailed description of this feature, please refer  to "TYMNET
        Circuit Protocol - Programmer's Reference manual".

             To make  use of  this feature,  the following  statement is  to be
        included in the .TYM file:

             DECLARE(MPVC,NUMBER)

             This  specifies  the  NUMBER of  Multiplexed  PVC  Pseudo-ports to
        assign;  the default is 0.  If zero or not defined, MPVC  capability is
        NOT included in the configuration.  The actual number of ports assigned
        to the configuration (normally  equal to the number of  physical ports)
        is  increased by  this  amount.  These  MPVC ports  will  originate the
        actual PVC's  used to multiplex  the other ports.   If this  causes the
        total number  of ports to  exceed constraints imposed  by the  code, an
        assembly diagnostic will be issued.

             The additional ports are defined, and the macro PVCRNG  is invoked
        to  automatically  declare them  all  PVC ports.   The  appropriate PVC
        exception conditions are also declared.






                  6.1  Macro:  MUTXRG(port range 1,...,port range n)


             Like UTXRNG,   except that  the port  number specified  applies to
        MPVC pseudo-ports only.

                        6.2  Macro:  MPVCUS(port range,USERID)


             This macro is used to define one of a set of USERID criteria for a
        port.   "Port range"  specifies the  range of  pseudo-port  numbers, as
        above.

               NOTE:   Currently, only  the first  port of  "port range"
                       will have  ports assigned --  the option  is open
                       for  future  expansion  in  the  areas  of  load-
                       leveling and improving response.

             USERID is a text string, used to distinguish various MPVC ports by
        matching with the first characters of the username.

             The USERID text string should be specified in upper-case.  Failure
        to do so will prevent successful matches.

             The text may contain special "wild-card" characters:


               "|" ("7C)  Match ANY valid user-name character.  Will NOT
                       match user-name terminator characters  (":", ";",
                       or <CR>).

               "}" ("7D)  End_of_match!   Encountering   this  character
                       during the matching process  signals (successful)
                       matching of username, even if entire username has
                       not  yet been  scanned (also  "matches" user-name
                       terminator characters).

             The following examples should help clarify this:

           USERID username   Remarks
             US     USE    Fails...names different length
             US|    USE    Succeeds...wild char
             US}    USE    Succeeds...end_of_match
            U|A}   USART   Succeeds...wild char, end_of_match
            U|E}   USART   Fails...wild char OK, "A" doesn't match "E"

               NOTE:   Successive MPVC USERID declarations  are examined
                       for  a  match  USERID in  DEFINITION  order  -- a
                       USERID  which  is a  substring  of  another (e.g.
                       "US}"  <<  "USA}") should  be  defined  later for
                       reliable action.  Note also that the  username is
                       converted  to UPPER  case ASCII  before  they are
                       compared -- thus "user" will match "US}".

             This macro  has a  number of different  fields, each  specifying a
        particular option.  These  options specify format conventions  for each
        MPVC -- ALL are required:

             Field 2 -- BLOKID

             This is the representation  of a single-character, either  in HEX,
        or  defined  with  radix  ($n  V).  It  is  used  to  define  a special
        multiplexed control code to identify that the following byte of data is
        a  sub-channel   identifier.   The   character  chosen   should  appear
        infrequently in the data stream and must be same characters as  used by
        host application.

             Field 3 -- SIGNID

             This is the representation  of a single-character, as in  Field 2.
        It is used to define a special multiplexed control code  to distinguish
        that the following byte (or  two bytes - for two-byte signals)  of data
        is  a  circuit-control  signal.   The  character  chosen  should appear
        infrequently in the data stream  and must be same character as  used by
        host application.

             Field 4 -- ESCID

             This is the representation  of a single-character, as in  Field 2.
        It is  used to  define a special  escape character  code to  permit the
        distinction of other codes from data.  It designates that the following
        byte  of  data is  (unconditionally)  data,  even if  it  has  the same
        representation as one of  the MPVC control characters  (BLOKID, SIGNID,
        or ESCID).  The character chosen must be same character as used by host
        application.

                                 7 -  Port Addressing


             The implementation  of the Port  addressing function  is primarily
        directed from the design of the CONSAT Video Display Unit interface.

             There  are  two  aspects  of  Port  Addressing  which  are visible
        external to the CONSAT.  These are:

            o   Configuration of ports susceptible to addressing;

            o   Differences  in usage  (as seen  by  the terminal
                user) for such ports.






                            7.1  Implementation Constraints


             The implementation has certain constraints associated with it:

             Specifically, operation is not supportable for the terminals which
        operate in a half duplex  line (as opposed to terminal)  protocol.  The
        obvious candidates  for affliction are  2741 and 3767  terminals, which
        are half-duplex by source-line.  The printer is not available while the
        keyboard is unlocked.  Seizing these ports does not provide the ability
        to  inform  the  terminal   of  seizure,  let  alone  the   ability  of
        communication).  Certain  types of half-duplex  modems also  cannot use
        the  port  addressing  function, notably  the  Bell  202S  (wherein the
        communications-link must be "turned- around").

             The above cases all use the "TYMNET Green-ball" to  activate these
        "turn-arounds".  As the intended  purpose of this Green-ball  signal is
        terminal-host   usage,   it  is   not   suited   for  terminal-terminal
        communications.   And there  is  an incapability  of  distinguishing an
        origination request from a response in this environment.

                        7.2  Configuration for Port Addressing


             In order to provide externally accessible port  addressing, CONSAT
        has to be configured to support the capability.  This capability is not
        inherent in the CONSAT; it will be present only if invoked.

             The parameters which  need to be  associated with one  another for
        this service are:

           o   Logical port number (or range of ports);
           o   Target Host number;
           o   Target Host attribute;
           o   Corresponding address (or range of addresses);
           o   Reverse Charge acceptability (for LOGII network
                  environment only.)


             The mechanism chosen  to perform these functions  is the use  of a
        family of macros:





                    7.2.1  Macro:  ADRZAP(port range 1,...port range n))

             This  macro defines  addressable  ports which  have  the following
        features:

           o When CONSAT is to disconnect this port, a Detach (9E) is 
             sent to the network instead of a Zapper (9F). This will 
             ensure that the data immediaely preceeded the disconnect
             signal will not be lost.

           o When a black ball is received by this port, CONSAT will
             disconnect this port so the user is informed of the 
             losing of data.

           o This port has to be an Async port and has been defined
             by the ADRPRT macro. If not, the above function does 
             not take effect. There will not be any assembly error
             or warning prompt at assembling time.

                    7.2.2  Macro:  ADRPRT(port range,host,addr range,attri,rc)

             This macro is used for the ASYNC ports.





                    7.2.3  Macro:  SADPRT(port range,host,addr range,attri,rc)

             This macro is used for the SIO ports.



        7.2.3.1  Macro Description

             In all cases arguments are decimal;  these are:
            PORT RANGE:  this is a port number (or range of ports, specified as
                "Low-High"), to which this declaration will apply.
            HOST:  The host  number which will be  used to target  these ports.
                (NOTE:  This  also becomes the  accounting or  origination host
                for circuits originating on this port, overriding  all previous
                declarations without warning.)
            ADDRESS RANGE:  The address (or range of addresses) assigned to the
                port (or range of  ports); in this case, successive  ports will
                be  assigned  successive  numeric  addresses  of Address_Range,
                until these are exhausted -- subsequent ports are  assigned the
                last Address.   The first  port of Port_Range  will be  used if
                this field is left blank.

            ATTRIBUTE:  The  attribute to  apply to  the specified  host; (this
                attribute refers  to the  condition where  the host  address is
                accessed without  use of an  associated sub-host  address [sub-
                host  address is  null]; a  declaration overrides  all previous
                declarations).   Values  are symbolic,  and  selected  from the
                list:

                NULL:   Null address is disallowed;
                ZERO:   Null address maps to address 0;
                ANY:    Null address maps to ANY address.
                ("NULL" is the default attribute if the field is left blank.)

            RC:  The  Reverse  Charge  Acceptability  indicates   whether  this
                addressable port  environment will  accept reverse  charging or
                not.  (This is supported in the LOGII network envirement only.)
                The  letters RC  must  be placed  in this  parameter  to enable
                acceptance of  reverse charge calls.  If this parameter  is not
                specified,  a  reverse charge  calls  will be  rejected  by the
                Supervisor.  CONSAT reports the reverse charging  capability to
                the Supervisor.  Supervisor validates a collect call   based on
                this reported capability.

             A macro can be invoked repeatedly for the same host to provide the
        capability for several sets of ports.  It also invokes the functions of
        the existing ACHOST, AHRNG, and SHRNG macros.

            NOTE:  previous  ACHOST declarations  will be lost,  and --  if not
                   overridden later -- the last such definition will become the
                   default origination host.   Thus all PA  declarations should
                   occur   before   other   ACHOST   declarations,   and   such
                   declarations  should  take  care  not  to  override  the  PA
                   declarations.

             Each port specified by RANGE  will be selected as a  PA candidate.
        Ports may be selected more than  once, to permit a physical port  to be
        accessible via more than one  host access (this will provide  levels of
        access  control to  specific  ports; one  user may  reference  a single
        host/sub-host, while a  second may have access  to a second  host which
        includes the first as one of the available sub-hosts).

             As a cross-check, PVC ports  will be checked to ensure  that there
        is no conflict between PVC usage and PA usage (such as PCO option).

             As a point of interest, the declaration will declare the host, and
        create a unique host:port:address assignment; this is later formed into
        a set of lists (one for each host) relating address to port.  A circuit
        arriving for a particular host will cause the corresponding list  to be
        searched, and  for each occurrence  of that address,  the corresponding
        port will be examined for activity.  If no address-match is  found, the
        circuit will be terminated  (with an appropriate message);  likewise if
        no  port is  available.   The circuit  will  be assigned  to  the first
        available port with that address.

             The  ability  to  specify multiple  ports  with  the  same address
        provides  the  capability  to  create  "rotors"  or   "hunt-groups"  (a
        collection of ports, any of which will accept a message).






                                  7.3  Terminal Usage


             The terminal  user will  see no change  in the  initial part  of a
        connection.

             Depending upon the PVC options (if any), he may get a "please type
        your terminal identifier",  "node:port identifier", and/or  "please log
        in".

             If  optioned  for ALO,  this  takes precedence  over  PA;  the ALO
        circuit is constructed, and the port is declared busy.

             At the end of the ALO  session -- or initially if there is  no ALO
        -- the user is presented with a "please log in" and the port  is placed
        in "limbo mode" state.  It remains in this state until:

            1.  The terminal is powered off (no longer answered);

            2.  The  port   is assigned  to   (commandeered  by)  PA usage;
                or

            3.  The user enters  the first character  of a new  logon (thus
                declaring   the  port   busy).    (NOTE...terminal  control
                characters,  such  as control-H  for  half-duplex,  are not
                considered  part  of  a  new  logon  for  this  usage.  The
                terminal  user  may  enter  such  control  characters while
                remaining  in limbo;  the entering  of the  first printable
                character of  the username causes  the port to  be declared
                busy.)

             Each session-end (denoted by  the arrival of a zapper)  will cause
        the port  to re-enter "limbo  mode", wherein it  is a candidate  for PA
        service, and  is not  attempting to build  a circuit.   As soon  as the
        first new logon character is entered, limbo gives way to logon.

             Note that there is a small but finite time-window during  which an
        active session could be zapped and PA service initiated before the user
        could  respond  with another  attempt  to build  a  circuit.   There is
        another, even  smaller window,  wherein the user  could type  the first
        character  of a  new logon,  and PA  could take  control away  from him
        before the CONSAT  saw the typed character.   Since the user  could not
        distinguish the actual sequence which occurred, he would have to assume
        that the character he had just typed was now directed back along the PA
        circuit.

             When a port is commandeered by a circuit, a message is output:

            "Port seized at [date] (GMT), by [origination I.D.]"

             Where:  [date] is the current time and date (GMT);  and

                     [origination I.D.] is the username, circuit
                       origination,  or other identification appropriate
                       to that circuit.

            NOTE:  There is at present an unresolved problem which needs to
                   be  addressed:   While  in  limbo,  the   user  terminal
                   displays "please log in".  When the port is  seized, the
                   "Port seized..."  message is output as a warning.  It is
                   possible,  particularly   with  CRT  terminals,   for  a
                   malicious user to seize a port, erase that  message, and
                   lie  in wait  for him  to attempt  a new  logon, thereby
                   capturing  his username  and password.   To  avoid this,
                   users must be cautioned to disconnect and  reconnect the

                   terminal before use  as a circuit origination,  after an
                   unattended period of "limbo" usage.





                    7.3.1  Usage while "Seized"

             A port in limbo may be seized by an incoming call.   While seized,
        there will be no  echoing in response to  input from either end  of the
        circuit (i.e.  both ends of the circuit are in "echo-off"  state).  Any
        echoing  is  thus  the  responsibility  of  (and  agreed  upon  by) the
        terminals at either end of the circuit.  This includes the insertion of
        LF after CR, CR after LF,  and all other special options.  If  the port
        is seized  by a  host, that host  may emit  an "echo-on"  signal, after
        which the  CONSAT port will  operate in the  normal fashion.   This is,
        however, not possible if the call originates at a CONSAT or TYMSAT.

             The circuit  is broken  (at the  seized port)  if either  a zapper
        arrives, or if the terminal is disconnected (powered off).  The arrival
        of a zapper will cycle the port back to the limbo state.






                                 7.4  External Access


             The Port-Addressing METHOD has two aspects:





                    7.4.1  Addressing by the user

             The user specifies  port-addressing by entering a  login-string of
        the form:
             USER:[HOSTNO][.ADDR];

            where:

             HOSTNO  The  [optional]  destination  host.    If  "home-
                     targeting" is used, this field may be omitted.

            .ADDR   The  [optional]  host  sub-address.   This  is  a
                    string  of  decimal  digits,  delimited   by  the
                    (required) "." prefix.  The absence of this field
                    is a "NULL  Sub-Address";  it causes  normal host
                    addressing.

                    7.4.2  Addressing at the Host

             The  "called" host  will  normally receive  as part  of  the login
        needle a username field of the form:

            USER[:[HOSTNO][.ADDR]]

             where HOSTNO and ADDR are described above.  "[...]" are optional.

             In the normal case, the string consists of "USER".

             In the case of transparent logins, the string  contains ":HOSTNO",
        and may also contain the ".ADDR" field, requesting sub-addressing.

             In  the  non-transparent  login  case,  the  string   consists  of
        "USER:.ADDR";

             In  all cases,  the called  host may  retrieve the  ADDR  field by
        scanning  the string  for ":"   (since USER  may contain  the character
        "."), and then  scanning past the subsequent  "."  and then  picking up
        the  ADDR  field.   If the  ADDR  field  is NULL,  then  the  scan will
        encounter the login string terminator (";" or <CR>) before  finding the
        ":"  -- "." sequence.

                       8 -  Port Addressing In LOGII Environment


               The functionality of the addressable port is fully  preserved in
        the LOGII network environment.  In addition, the new features have been
        enhanced  for  the  Port Addressing.   For  example,  during  the login
        process,  the user  may specify  the multiple  host addresses  and sub-
        addresses (according  to the LOGII  Specified Destination  List format)
        for the ports  which need to be  addressed.  Furthermore, the  user may
        also be able to address a port in the X.121 addressing scheme.






                        8.1  Port Addressing With Normal Login


             In the LOGII  network system environment,  the user is  allowed to
        specify the  multiple destination  host number  and sub-address  in the
        specified destination list.  Thus,
          
        New Login Syntax:

        [ option ] [ user  ] [ destination ] [ extension ] [ password ]
        [ field  ] [ field ] [    list     ] [   field   ] [   field  ]
         
        For example:   |           |                              |
                       |           |                              |
                       v           v                              v
        please login:isistech:120.0,121.1,120.2,120.3,120.4,120.5;


                  This can  be used to  address a set  of ports  at destination
        interface upon whichever port  is available first.  However,  one thing
        should be  noted that there  will be only  one destination  host number
        selected,  and  used,  by the  supervisor  during  the  port addressing
        process.  The  LOGII Port Addressing  process will use  the destination
        host number as  a base address to  search the destination list  for the
        corresponding sub-address which maps the port that is addressable.  The
        search process will take place in the order as sub-address specified in
        the destination list.

                      8.2  Port Addressing with X.121 Addressing


                  The user is able to address a port by using the X.121 address
        in the LOGII network system environment.  There are some  criteria have
        to be met in order to do this.

             o An NTN string must be defined for the addressable port in the
               destination interface.

             o X.121 address that consists of DNIC and the corresponding NTN
               number must be validated in the MUD.






                     8.3  Macro:  ANTNMP(NTN,P0,P1,P2,...,P13,P14)


             The ANTNMP macro maps the Network Terminal Numbers with  the ASYNC
        ports.  Default is no NTN mapping for ports.






                     8.4  Macro:  SNTNMP(NTN,p0,p1,p2,...,p13,p14)


             The SNTNMP macro maps  the Newtwork Terminal Numbers with  the SIO
        ports.  Default is no NTN mapping for ports.

             The ANTNMP macro  and SNTNMP macro associate  the NTN, one  to ten
        digits long, with the ports defined in the p0-p14 parameters.

             This NTN is  used by the CONSAT,  when receiving an  incoming call
        request,  to  search  for  the port  number(s)  defined  for  this NTN.
        Multiple NTN mapping  macros can be specified  to map multiple  NTNs to
        the same ports.

             When <DNIC> <NTN> is used as the destination address,  CONSAT will
        receive this X.121 address  in the incoming needle from  the Supervisor
        in the form of  - <DNIC> <NTN>.  If  the requested <NTN> is  not found,
        the circuit will be rejected by the CONSAT.  If the <NTN> is found, the
        port assignment is based on the following rules.

             First, the terminating host  number is checked for  the associated
        port  range  assignments defined  by  the host  definition  macros, for
        example, the ADRPRT or  INCOMINGCALL macros.  The port number  is cross

        checked with the port range defined.  If no common ports can  be found,
        the circuit is rejected.  If more than one is found, the  assignment is
        then based on the attribute defined by the macros.

             The port number identifiers, p0-p14, can be a single  port number,
        or they can be a range of ports in ascending order.

             If this macro  is not defined, the  call requests that  comes into
        the CONSAT will not go through the NTN-to-port mapping process, and the
        requests  will  be granted  on  the basis  of  the  port's availability
        associated with the terminating host number.

             TELEX "Extension  Cord" service provides  the ability to  make and
        receive TELEX calls through  the network using a teletype  terminal.  A
        TELEX terminal will be connected to a CONSAT PVC port which  provides a
        circuit  to  the  TELEX  Gateway, thus  providing  a  virtual  two wire
        connection through the network.  An IIX protocol passes  the signalling
        necessary  to  place  or  receive  TELEX  calls.   In  order  for TELEX
        "Extension Cord" services, the TELEX Gateway has to be kept informed of
        the current terminal signalling state, and must be able to control it.






                                9.1  Terminal Interface


             All signalling and character transmission takes place  through the
        transmit and receive wires.   Call signalling and states  are signalled
        by providing either  steady space or marking  on these wires.   The pin
        assignments on the RS232 connector are:

              Pin no. 2    Transmit
              Pin no. 3    Receive
              Pin no. 7    Signal Ground.

             Signalling  is space  (positive 12  volts) and  mark  (negative 12
        volts).  A change in signal (i.e.  space to mark) must be of a duration
        greater than 150 milliseconds to be recognized.  The default signalling
        from the CONSAT to the terminal will be spacing.

             In order to clarify further discussion, the transmit path from the
        TELEX terminal through the network to the TELEX network will  be called
        the forward path; the path from TELEX to terminal, backward path.

             The TELEX Gateway is IIX capable, and has its own  sub-dialect for
        passing  the signalling  states.  After  a circuit  is  established the
        Gateway sends the IIX Select  Dialect with only the TELEX dialect  as a
        choice.  (Although it is a Gateway, it does not speak  "Gateway".)  The
        CONSAT must return an acceptance  of this dialect, or the  Gateway will
        zap the circuit.  The CONSAT sends spacing on the backward path (to the
        terminal)  and does  not respond  to any  signalling from  the terminal
        unless a network circuit is established.






                                9.4  TELEX IIX Dialect


             Because TELEX uses an IIX smart circuit, it is necessary to handle
        all of the Global IIX messages  as well as those of the  TELEX dialect.
        (See  attached  IIX messages  chart.)   The TELEX  dialect  type  is 11
        (8091),  the gateway  product ID  is 5E,  and uses  only  TELEX dialect
        message types 0-3 (C080-C083).  The rightmost bit represents the signal
        on the backward path; the next bit, the forward path.  The  CONSAT will
        only send  these messages if  it detects a  change in the  forward path
        signalling, or in response to  one of these messages from  the Gateway.
        Upon receipt of  a 0 type message,  the CONSAT will force  the backward
        path  to space  and return  the current  states to  the  Gateway.  Upon
        receipt of a 1,2, or 3 type message, the CONSAT will compare  the state
        of the  forward path with  the message state,  and if they  match, will
        force the backward path to the message state (1,3 = mark; 2 = space).

             Version 3.05 (and later)  of the ISIS CONSAT provides  support for
        logging devices with TELEX  signalling to log into the  TYMNET network.
        This  means that  either a  TELEX terminal,  or a  switch  using single
        subscriber signalling, can be connected to a port on the CONSAT.






                                10.1  TELEX Signalling


             TELEX  RS-232  Signalling  uses  only  three  lines  (pins):   the
        transmit and receive  data lines, and signal  ground (pins 2,3  and 7).
        The state  of the  terminal is  indicated using  only the  transmit and
        receive data lines.  DSR/DTR signals are not used, and will  be ignored
        by the CONSAT.

             The  transmit  and  receive  data  lines  have  two  states, SPACE
        (positive  12  volts)  and  MARK  (negative  12  volts).    When  being
        interpreted as data, SPACE is 0, MARK is 1.

             When  the terminal  or  device is  not  being used,  the  send and
        receive data lines maintain a spacing (continuous break)  signal.  When
        the device wishes to initiate a Telex call, the signal from  the device
        is changed to marking (all 1's).  In TELEX terminology, this is  a CALL
        REQUEST.   The  receiving device  will  then respond  by  changing it's
        signal to  marking (CALL CONFIRM).   Data can now  be passed  in either
        direction.

                                10.2  Data Translation


             TELEX traffic is in ITA No.  2 (International Telegraph Alphabet),
        a  five  bit  data  code  sometimes  called  BAUDOT.   The  CONSAT will
        translate this code  to ASCII for  communicating with the  network, and
        all data received from the  network will be translated to  BAUDOT.  See
        the appendix for actual data code translation tables.






                              10.3  Connection To CONSAT


             For connection  to the CONSAT,  the CONSAT will  supply continuous
        spacing.  Only if the signalling  state from the terminal goes  to mark
        from space (CALL  REQUEST), will the  CONSAT respond.  The  CONSAT will
        respond with a mark (CALL CONNECT) and attempt to log in the device.

             For terminals, the option  NOWRU is declared, and the  CONSAT will
        immediately send the greeting message and "please log in:" message.  On
        many terminals, the CALL REQUEST is  sent by using the CALL CLR  key on
        the terminal.

             For  connection directly  to  a TELEX  switch, the  WRU  option is
        declared.   After the  CALL REQUEST/CONFIRM  exchange, the  CONSAT will
        wait 16 seconds  for an ITA  No.  2 WRU  character (Figures Shift  - D)
        from the  TELEX switch.   When this  WRU is  received, the  CONSAT will
        respond with an assembled answerback string, and then send the greeting
        and "please log in:"  messages.

             NOTE:   This  connection  currently  has  only  been  tested  on a
        SIEMAN's  EDX switch  at FTCC.   Other equipment  may, or  may  not, be
        compatible with this function.

             The connection to  the network is terminated  by the receipt  of a
        TELEX DISCONNECT (line state switches to spacing) from the device.  The
        CONSAT will zap  the network circuit and  respond by returning  a TELEX
        DISCONNECT to the DEVICE.

             If a  network zapper is  received by the  CONSAT, the  CONSAT will
        initiate the exchange of disconnects.

        The port must also be defined as AID; Two kinds of speed  supported are
        50 and 75 baud async BAUDOT (not SIO).

             There are two  new options specifically  for TID34 and  TID35 type
        ports:  WRU and  NOWRU.  The default is  WRU.  The option  controls the
        exchange between the TELEX device and the CONSAT prior to  a successful
        login (see B1 above).  If WRU, an answerback must be defined  using the
        ABACK macro.

             The ABACK macro defines a  text answerback to be sent  in response
        to  WRU  characters  received  from  a  TELEX  device.  This  device is
        connected to a TID34 and TID35 type port.

             The term Speedlink refers to customer's private  telegraph network
        used  for exchanging  messages  between customer's  offices  around the
        world.  Speedlink telex uses  polarity key signalling to  indicate line
        state.  There are four types of connections to support:


        1.[50 baud Polar Key]  [Originating]  [Terminating]  [ SPEEDLINK  ]
          [  TELEX device   ]==[  CONSAT   ]::[  CONSAT   ]==[TELEX switch]

          [   ASCII switch  ]==[  CONSAT   ]::[  CONSAT   ]==[ASCII switch ]



             Three new TID  entries, TID36, TID37,  and TID38, support  type 1,
        type 2, and type 3 telex connections respectively.  Old  TID10 supports
        the type 4 connection.






                             11.1  Polarity Key Signalling


             Polarity  Key  Signalling  is different  from  the  standard Telex
        signalling:  It provides a continuous terminal connection; there are no
        line state changes after connection; no WRU (Who aRe YoU) or answerback
        characters  are exchanged.   A connected  device supplies  a continuous
        'MARK' (referred to many names:  Z polarity, stop polarity, binary "1",
        or on-condition)  on the  device TD line.   If the  device fails  or is
        turned  off, a  'SPACE'  (referred to  many names:   A  polarity, start
        polarity, binary "0", or off-condition) signal is generated.

             The  standard  asynchronous  ports  on  the  engine  use  a 25-pin
        connector.  For polarity signalling, the only pins used are pin 2 (TD--

        Transmitted Data),  pin 3  (RD--Received Data),  and pin  7 (SG--Signal
        Ground).

             Connection type 1 to type  3 use the Polar Key signalling  for the
        line control.  The terminal and the other end of switch tell each other
        they are ready to receive messages by transmitting continuous 'MARK'.

             Connection type 4  uses Processor To Processor  (PTP) Interconnect
        Control.  PTP is a customer's protocol for the two  switches constantly
        to exchange control messages to  ensure the circuit is up  between them
        in both directions.   CONSAT can support  PTP protocol by  treating two
        switches as standard ASCII asynchronous start/stop devices.






                   11.2  Connection to CONSAT and Data Transmission


             All connections to the CONSAT use the standard  asynchronous ports
        on the TYMNET Engine.  Use of these features on Serial I/O  (SIO) ports
        is not supported.

             The network  connection between CONSATs  uses a  permanent virtual
        circuit  (PVC) and  the port  addressing capability.   The  CONSAT port
        initiating a circuit is referred to as the 'originating' port,  and the
        CONSAT port receiving the  circuit is referred to as  the 'terminating'
        port.

             Both  CONSATs  (Originating  &  Terminating)  initially  output  a
        continuous  SPACE  to  their  connected  devices.   The  CONSAT  at the
        originating end attempts to build a circuit if a continuous  MARK state
        is being received from the device at the originating end.  This circuit
        is accomplished  by using PVC  options of AID,  ALO, PCO.   The circuit
        terminates at another  CONSAT and is connected  to a port by  using the
        Port  Addressing mechanism.   The terminating  CONSAT only  accepts the
        circuit if the device at the terminating end is outputting a MARK.

             If either device toggles the  line state from MARK to  SPACE, both
        CONSATs will emit a continuous SPACE and zap the network  circuit until
        a network circuit is completed.   Both CONSATs will send a MARK  to the
        devices only if  a network circuit  exists.  If the  originating CONSAT
        fails on attempting to build a circuit, a new PCO retry timer parameter
        PCOWAT  will  delay  a  period of  PCOWAT  time  before  rebuilding the
        circuit.

             Once a circuit is built,  it provides a transparent path  for data
        exchange between two end devices.  There is no data translation (Baudot
        to ASCII or ASCII to Baudot) involved for type 1 & 2.

             The purpose of  the S-mode project is  to develop support  for the
        interconnection  of  Microdata  terminals and  hosts  using  the TYMENT
        technology network and S-mode (Sovereign) connection.






                                12.2  S-mode Connection


             To be able to connect Microdata terminals in S-mode, the terminals
        to  be  supported  are  as  for  R-mode  (Reality)  connection.  S-mode
        connection also  requires Sovereign (M8000)  host computers.  CONSAT S-
        mode  supports the  interface between  Microdata terminals  and TYMNET;
        TYMCOM S-mode supports  the interface between Sovereign  host computers
        and TYMNET.  The terminals which support the  S-mode connection are:
         
         1) PRISM-4
         2) PRISM-5
         3) M100 - PRISM 4/5 emulator
         4) PRISM-14






                      12.3  Differences Between R-mode and S-mode


             The  differences  between  S-mode and  R-mode  on  Microdata Prism
        terminals are:

           1) In R-mode, each key depression generates one character;
              In S-mode, each key depression generates two characters.

              These character pairs are one character of information
              (>= E0 hex) and one character data (20 to DF hex).
              Additionally, all characters generated in S-mode are 8-bit
              data offset from 20(hex) i.e. no control characters can be 
              generated.

              NOTE: there is an exception to this, the firmware can 
                    issue XON and XOFF (hex 11 and 13), if this 
                    backpressure mechanism is used.

           2) In R-mode connection, the terminal stays in R-mode. 
              In S-mode connection, the terminal powers up in R-mode, 
              and switched to S-mode on receiving the "enter S-mode"
              control code (E1 hex). It can be switched back to R-mode
              by the host, or by the CONSAT when circuit is disconnected.






                                12.4  Call Description


             The steps  involved in the  establishment of an  S-mode connection
        are as follows:

             (1) User turns on terminal in R-mode.

             (2) The CONSAT detects the change in signalling, and either,
                 if the port is not AID, forces space parity (TIDSPP) and
                 sends the "please type your terminal identifier" message;
                 or, if AID, passes on to (4).

             (3) User enters TID of "O".

             (4) CONSAT sets up port, with no transparency, masking all
                 data output to 7-bit with space parity.

             (5) CONSAT sends to terminal the Node/Port number, any 1-down
                 message, and "please log in:" prompt.

             (6) User logs in as usual.

             (7) TYMCOM receives needle from network Supervisor, recognizes
                 the IIX capability, sends back "Select Dialect" command
                 to the CONSAT.
                 CONSAT then goes through the dialect negotiation process
                 for the S-Mode connection.

             (8) After connected to the host, TYMCOM sends enter-transparency
                 mode (ETM) signal. Now, data in 8-bit set are passed through
                 the network. Option E8BTM has to be set in the TYMCOM macro

             (9) TYMCOM sends the Load Message string in the IIX sub-
                 dialect message to the CONSAT. This string is defined in
                 the TYMCOM configuration macro TBYEMS. The string contains
                 the terminal control code (EB hex) used to enter R-mode
                 and the parity option which indicates the parity mode when
                 the message is to be sent to the terminal.

             (10) CONSAT receives the  sub-dialect message, saves those
                  information in the buffer.

             (11) TYMCOM sends the terminal control code (E1 hex) to 
                  switch the terminal in R-mode to in S-mode. This is 
                  performed only when the E1 code is defined in the
                  TYMCOM configuration macro TINTMS.

             (12) CONSAT passes the control code (E1 hex), if defined
                  and passed to the CONSAT in ISIS data message, to the
                  terminal to force it into S-mode.

             NOTE: Step (11) and (12) depends on TYMCOM configuration.
                   The Sovereign computer can also send the E1 or EB
                   code at any time to switch the terminal mode.
              
             (13) TYMCOM sends <break> OFF <CR> to host.

             (14) User to host session in S-mode is established.

             (15) Each key depression generates two characters. 
                  CONSAT passes pair characters to the network, and the
                  host interprets this pair and echoes the corresponding
                  characters (but may choose to echo something entirely
                  different, e.g. $ or pound-sterling sign depending on
                  the shift key used).

             (16) If network circuit is lost, TYMCOM sends host <break>
                  OFF <CR> and zaps circuit.

             (17) If host is not available or disconnected, TYMCOM sends
                  IIX clear message(C080), and CONSAT will clear the
                  Load Message  saved in the buffer.

                  NOTE: TYMCOM may clear the stored message at any time.

             (18) Loss of network circuit causes CONSAT to leave 
                  transparency mode and if there is a stored message,
                  the  message is sent to the terminal with the parity
                  specified before the circuit is disconnected.

             (19) New login begins.

                               13.1  Purpose of Outdial


             Outdial allows the same set of ports to accept incoming calls, and
        the new capability  of making calls.  This  will allow hosts  the added
        security of being able to  dial back to users, hosts to  leave messages
        to remote PCs,  network users access to  hosts not in the  network, and
        other uses.  The CONSAT will still be able to have  hardwired terminals
        and accept incoming calls.






                           13.2  Network Access for Outdial


             The  user will  log  into the  Outdial CONSAT  through  a standard
        network circuit.   The Outdial CONSAT  will return a  greeting message,
        and prompt the user for the desired command.






                              13.3  Outdial command mode


             While  in  command  mode  the user  enters  commands  in  order to
        establish an  Outdial connection.  Once  connected to  the destination,
        the originator leaves  command mode and  may not reenter.   Thus, these
        are distinct, separate states.

        Outdial                                                    May 10, 1988


                               13.4  Inactivity Timeout


             While in command mode, the user will be timed out after the period
        specified in the OUTHOST macro.  If not specified, the  default timeout
        is two minutes  of inactivity.  There  is no timeout  of any sort  on a
        completed call.






                                13.5  Outdial Commands


             The Outdial command mode has seven commands:

           DIAL, BPS, SET, RETRY, TERSE, HELP, and LOGOUT.


             The command processor accepts  shortened forms of the  commands in
        both upper and  lower cases.  For  example, the command  processor will
        accept D,  di, or even  DiAl, as  the command DIAL,  but not  DIL.  All
        commands, except DIAL,  must have a space  between the command  and the
        value field.  Control-H will  backspace over the last  character typed.
        The command line  will be terminated with  a carriage return (CR)  or a
        linefeed  (LF).  An  ESC or  control-X will  abort the  current command
        line.





                    13.5.1  Dial Command

             The command Dial is to be followed by a phone number  field.  This
        field will  ignore blanks,  periods, parenthesis  and slashes,  but may
        contain three subcommands; T, P,  and ','.  The first two  specify Tone
        (default or Pulse dialing, respectively.  A comma causes a  short pause
        before Outdial will continue dialing.

             Example:  To dial an access number, then a slow  responding, pulse
        only switchboard the proper command  is DIAL T 555-1212 ,  555-1234 ,,P
        4444

             The  dial  command  is  the  last  command  to  be  issued.   If a
        successful connection is  made then the  circuit is completed.   If the
        call is not answered then  the originator is returned to  command mode.
        If  the call  was  answerred, but  connection  did not  occur  then the
        originator  is  logged  out.  Accounting  would  be  significantly more
        difficult if  the user  was allowed to  make another  call in  the same
        session.

             NOTE:   Certain  area  codes  can be  screened  out  by  a tymfile
        parameter.   International, Canadian  and  Mexican area  codes  will be
        defaulted as illegal.





                    13.5.2  Retry Command

             The RETRY  command redials  the last phone  number along  with all
        previously set options (such as baud rate).





                    13.5.3  BPS Command

             The command BPS sets the desired baud rate.  The value  field will
        contain the baud rate.  The baud rate will default to the highest speed
        possible.  This  will be limited  by the engine  configuration, Outdial
        modem,  and the  answering modem.   The Outdial  modem will  adjust its
        speed to the  speed of the answering  modem, but never faster  than the
        speed set by BPS.





                    13.5.4  SET Command

             The   SET  command   allows  the   user  to   set   some  terminal
        characteristics of the remote device.  The recognized value  fields are
        XON, RXON, EVEN,  SPACE, CRDELAY and HALF.   XON allows the  network to
        backpressure  the  remote device.   RXON  allows the  remote  device to
        backpressure  the network.   EVEN sets  even parity,  while  SPACE sets
        space parity.  CRDELAY causes a short delay after both CR and LF.  HALF
        sets half duplex.

             These and other terminal  characteristics can also be set  by ISIS
        messages.  If a value set by a B1 msg conflicts with a  value specified
        by the SET command,  the most recent value  is taken to be  the desired
        value.

                    13.5.5  LOGOUT Command

             LOGOUT zaps the circuit.  LOGOUT is only valid in command mode and
        before the command DIAL.  Once  a connection is made the  circuit stays
        up until either carrier is lost or a zapper is received.





                    13.5.6  TERSE Command

             The TERSE command  combines SET and  DIAL into one  command.  This
        allows the user to send  one string to specify all parameters  and make
        the  call.  TERSE  expects one  character parameters  in  the following
        order:  H (half-duplex) or N (no half-duplex), X (XON/XOFF  support) or
        N (no XON/XOFF support), R (reverse XON/XOFF support) or N  (no reverse
        XON/XOFF  support),  E (even  parity)  or  S (space  parity)  or  N (no
        parity), D (delay after carriage return) or N (no delay  after carriage
        return), an optional sixth character to specify speed (5 for 300 bps; 7
        for 1200 bps, and  8 for 2400 bps),  followed by the phone  number with
        any of the dial subcommands.  TERSE expects no spaces or punctuation in
        the five or six character parameter field.  For example, "T  NNREN5 555
        1234" sets RXON and even parity, and dials 555 1234 at 300  bps.  TERSE
        also returns numerical messages to the user.





                    13.5.7  HELP Command

             HELP  lists the  commands  and their  options.  The  TERSE  is not
        listed under the HELP command  since the TERSE command would  require a
        multi-page help  listing to  explain both the  command and  the digital
        response messages.






                               13.6  Accounting Addenda


             Outdial will use the following accounting messages.

                               13.7  Modem Requirements


             Outdial  currently only  works with  the Concord  Trispeed modems.
        Any other modem  to be used  in the future  with Outdial must  first be
        acceptable for use  as an indial modem.   The modem must also  have the
        following features:

           1)  The modem will be auto-dial and auto-answer.

           2)  The modem's command mode must be able to answer 
               incoming calls and signal the Consat.  This prevents an
        bb       incoming call from connecting to an intended outgoing call.

           3)  The modem's dial command should be able to wait for a 
               second tone or be able to pause a few seconds during dialing.

           4)  If the modem changes speed after dialing (while connecting),
               it must notify the Consat of the new speed at the old speed.

           5)  The modem must be able to accept some type of command 
               setting the maximum speed.

           6)  The modem, once connected, should not allow the user to
               reenter command mode.






             13.8  Macro:  OUTHOST(host,command ports,inactivity timer,rc)


             OUTHOST is  the only  required macro and  MUST follow  the DECLARE
        macros.   OUTHOST(host,  command  ports,  inactivity  timer)  sets  the
        Outdial host number, the  maximum number of command ports  (default 16,
        maximum 32), and  the inactivity timer  for command ports  (default 120
        seconds).   The number  of command  port is  how many  users can  be in
        command mode at one time.   This does not affect the number  of Outdial
        connections.   For example,  four users  could be  in command  mode and
        forty people could have Outdial connections.

             The "rc"  parameter takes effects  only in the  LOGII environment.
        It instructs CONSAT  to report the  reverse charging capability  to the
        Supervisor  so  that collect  call  requests can  be  validated  by the
        Supervisor.   If rc  is defined  in this  macro, this  port  can accept
        collect call.

                          13.9  Macro:  OUTGREET(text string)


             The OUTGREET macro sets Outdial's greeting message defined  in the
        text string.






                         13.10  Macro:  OUTPROMPT(text string)


             The OUTPROMPT macro sets  Outdial's command prompt.  If  used, the
        macro overrides the default command prompt (>).






               13.11  Macro:  OUTBAD(area code 1,...,area code N,label)


             The OUTBAD macro  defines illegal area codes not to be dialed.  If
        the label OKINTER is included then international numbers can be dialed.
        If the label  BADINTER is included  then international numbers   as not
        dialable (default).

             If OUTBAD is specified then OUTGOOD may not be specified.






                  13.12  Macro:  OUTGOOD(area code 1,...,area code N)


             The  OUTGOOD macro  defines  the set  of  area codes  that  can be
        dialed, all area codes not included are illegal.

             If OUTGOOD is specified then OUTBAD may not be specified.

                       13.13  Outdial Configuration Verification


             The  inclusion  of  OUTHOST adds  the  Outdial  capability  to the
        CONSAT.  Use of the other three macros without OUTHOST will  be flagged
        as an assembly error.  If both OUTBAD and OUTGOOD are specified then an
        assembly error is printed  out during assembly.  Outdial does  not need
        tymfile parameters to set Outdial capable ports or the type of modem at
        the port.  It tests each modem  to see if the modem has a  command mode
        and  then determine  the modem  type.  Any  modem with  a  command mode
        (autodial capability) will be assumed to be an Outdial port.






                                13.14  Outdial Messages


             After the user logs into Outdial CONSAT they receive  the greeting
        message.  After successfully completing a command an 'OK' will be sent.
        All responses will  be followed by a  carriage return and a  line feed.
        The digital codes are sent in response to the TERSE command.

             The numeric response codes are broken into three classes:

           Class A (000 -049)  -- command was completed without error.
           Class B (050 - 099) -- command could not be completed.

                              13.16  Circuit Limitations


             All of the current  circuit capabilities will still exist,  but no
        new features will be added.  Though the Outdial may build circuits from
        users  on a  Consat and  connect to  a host,  it will  not  perform the
        functions of a Tymcom.  Thus,  a Consat to Outdial circuit  cannot have
        local echo at either end.  This implies a Consat to Outdial  circuit is
        a virtual phone call with buffering capability.

             NOTE:  If  the origination and  destinations ports  have different
        bps set, the slower port must be able to backpressure the  faster port.
        Otherwise, data will be  lost due to the limited  bufferring capability
        of the network.   Thus, a slow origination  port should use the  BPS or
        SET RXON commands to set the destination to the same low speed.  A fast
        origination port should be  setup to allow the network  backpressure it
        (control-X or control-R at login).

             PAD   stands   for  the   packet   Assembly/Disassembly  facility.
        CONSAT/PAD is the  Tymnet version of  PAD. It provides  the packetizing
        and depacketizing functions in accordance with the CCITT (International
        Telegraph  And  Telephone Concultative  Committee)  Recommendation X.3,
        X.28, and X.29.

             Recommendation X.3 defines the  operation and function of  the PAD
        in support of a start-stop terminal.

             Recommendation X.28 defines the procedures by which the start-stop
        terminal can interact with the PAD.

             Recommendation X.29  defines the procedures,  use, and  formats of
        X.29 PAD messages that are sent  between an X.25 DTE and local  PAD, or
        between the PAD supporting a  non-X.25 DTE and the local PAD.   An X.29
        PAD message is an X.25 qualified data packet.

             Recommendation X.25 defines the  procedures used by the PAD  in an
        connection between the start-stop terminal and the remote DTE.

             CCITT  uses  both  "reference and  "parameter"  in  regard  to the
        functionality  of PAD.   Herein,  throughout this  document,  these two
        terms will be used interchangeably.






                            14.1  CONSAT/PAD - Introduction


             The CONSAT interface has been enhanced to perform the functions of
        a PAD as defined by the CCITT in X.3, X.28, and X.29.  This enhancement
        is also  called CONSAT/PAD  to distinguish it  from the  general CONSAT
        functions.  Features have been  added to these specifications  in order
        to make the  CONSAT/PAD easier to  use (see Clear  Confirmation Message
        Test Section).  Some slight departures from the standard also  occur to
        give  more  flexibility to  the  interface (see  Terminal  Message Text
        Content Section).

             This  document gives  a  brief outline  of the  appearance  of the
        CONSAT/PAD to  a user including  the standard command  set, a  table of
        service  signals  (messages),  and  a  list  of  enhancements   to  and
        departures from the standard.  Knowledge of the CONSAT and all relevant

        CCITT Recommendations (X.3, X.28,  X.29, X.25) is assumed and  will not
        be reiterated here.

             The configuration options of  the CONSAT/PAD are explained  in the
        CONSAT/PAD System Generation Section.





                    14.1.1  CONSAT/PAD Restrictions

                   - MPVC ports cannot have PAD functions
                   - usernames may not contain the characters +  <CR>
                     , ; : - or any control characters
                   - passwords may not contain the characters + <CR> , ; -
                   - PAD enhanced options are currently only available to 
                     full duplex ASCII terminals
                   - PAD enhanced options are currently only available to
                     async (not SIO) ports






                    14.1.2  Modes of the CONSAT

              In addition to the  "login" and "data transfer"  modes previously
        existing on a CONSAT, there is now a "command" mode from which X.28 and
        TYMNET extended commands may be executed.





                    14.1.3  Accessing the CONSAT/PAD modes

             The  CONSAT/PAD may  be configured  (on a  per port  basis)  to be
        initially in the login mode or in the command mode (see macro POSMODE).
        The  ability  of  a  port  to  switch  between  these  modes   is  also
        configurable.  If the login mode is the initial mode, then  the "please
        login:"  message is sent to  a port and the terminal parameters  is set
        according to profile 0 (internal use only).

             If  the command  mode  is the  initial  mode, then  a  "pad ready"
        message  is sent  followed  by a  command  prompt .   The  X.3 terminal
        parameters is set as specified by the default profile of a port.

             If a  port is so  configured, a user  may enter command  mode from
        login mode by typing the <break> key at any time up until  the password
        terminator  (or  username terminator  if  no password  is  required) is

        entered.  Whenever a port switches from login mode to command mode, the
        terminal parameters are set according to the default profile of a port.

             If  a port  is so  configured, a  user may  enter login  mode from
        command mode by entering the LOGIN command (eg.  login<CR>) at any time
        providing that  a call  is not  already in  progress.  Whenever  a port
        switches from command mode  to login mode, the terminal  parameters are
        set  according  to  profile 0  (internal  use  only -  see  Table  5 in
        Appendix) for compatibility with those general CONSAT functions..






                                14.2  TERMINAL COMMANDS


             The  terminal commands  may only  be executed  when a  port  is in
        command mode and takes one of two forms:

            o When the port connected to the terminal is configured 
              in the "pure" CCITT X.28 command mode ---

              The commands must be entered at the terminal verbatim,
              as the CCITT syntax is not at all forgiving.  

            o When the port is configured to be in the TYMNET 
              Extended  X.28 command mode ---

              The command names for this form may be typed in full
              or may be abbreviated to as few as three characters
              for all commands and to one character for the Selection
              command.


             The commands affecting terminal parameters are summarized in Table
        1 and a summary of all commands appears in Table 4.

             The  command  formats  are described  according  to  the following
        syntax:

           o  Brackets (ie.  [ and ]) are used to indicate that 
              the enclosed information is optional.
              (eg.  [A][B] means that both "A" and "B" are optional).

           o  Braces (ie.  left brace and right brace) are used to 
              indicate that at least one of the enclosed parameters
              must be specified.

           o  A slash (ie.  /) indicates an "or" function.
              (eg.  left brace A/B/C right brace means that one of
              either "A" or "B" or "C" must be specified).

           o  Command names are written in upper and lower case.
              The upper case portion must be entered, but the lower
              case portion is optional (for ports configured to 
              operate in the TYMNET Extended mode).


             CONSAT/PAD  command  responses  or  unsolicited   service  signals
        consist  of  a  mandatory and  an  optional  (configurable)  part.  The
        mandatory portion is written in upper case (although it will  appear in
        lower case on a terminal screen) and the optional portion is written in
        lower case.

             An  underscore (_)  indicates a  blank space  and must  be entered
        wherever specified if  the TYMNET Extended  mode of operation  is used,
        regardless of the  command length.  A question  mark (?)  must  also be
        entered wherever specified.





                    14.2.1  Service Request Signal (TID character)

             This  is really  a pseudo-command  and must  be entered  after the
        CONSAT has prompted the  terminal for a terminal  identifier regardless
        of the initial terminal mode.

             Only full duplex ASCII terminals are currently supported under the
        PAD functions.  TIDs  used on the port  functions as a  CONSAT/PAD port
        has to correspond to these terminal types.

             In  addition  to  these  TIDs  supported  in  the  existing Consat

        sets terminal characteristics similar to the A TID, it also   sets  the

                    14.2.2  Selection PAD Command Signal)

             The  Selection PAD Command Signal is used to make an outgoing call
        from  a DTE  connected to  a  CONSAT/PAD port  to a  remote  DTE.  This
        command signal consists of three blocks:
                        BLOCKS                  LOGI            LOGII
           o  the Facility Request Block     (mandatory)     (optional)
           o  the Address Block              (optional)      (mandatory)
           o  the Call User Data Block       (optional)      (optional)


             The X.28 PAD Selection Command Signal Syntax look as follows:

        [facility request block] [address block] [call user data block]


             The selection command is terminated with a carriage return or plus
        sign "+"; therefore these characters  should only appear at the  end of
        the command.

        14.2.2.1  Facility Request Block

             The Facility Request  Block consists of several  facility requests
        marked by facility request codes.  Each request is separated by a comma
        ",".   The following  is the  general format  for the  facility request
        block:

                G__,N_________,R,T____,TCL=n-


             The dash  "-" marks the  end of this  block.  The  descriptions of
        each request code can be found in the following sections.

              Example:    G01,NJSMITH;password,R,T3106,TCL=4-


             The character and line delete editing characters, when  entered by
        the  user, will  be acted  upon by  the PAD.   The only  characters not
        allowed to be  deleted are those that  are not echoed.  Please  see the
        NUI Facility Code Enhancements,  and Call User Data  Block Enhancements
        for the specific exceptions.

             The Line Display editing function is still invalid when entering a
        Selection PAD Command.  Depending  upon the X.3 parameter  six setting,
        an error message is displayed when this editing function is requested.

             All  characters  are locally  echoed  by the  PAD  except  for the
        password portion  of the NUI  facility, and those  characters following
        the P Option in the Call User Data Block.

             The TYMNET supported facility codes are as follows:

                G     - This code requests the Closed User Group selection.
                        The "G" should be directly followed
                        by a closed user group index number.
                        The index number will be used to find the
                        associated interlock code.

                        Example:  Gcc

                        The closed user group index number "cc" is 
                        specified by a two digit decimal number.

                N      - indicates that NUI selection is being requested.
                         The "N" is directly followed by the Network User
                         Identification (NUI). 

                         The LOGI NUI will have the following format:

                                Nusername;password

                         The "username;" is echoed but the optional password
                         following the ";" is not echoed.

                         When the NUI consists of a username and password, 
                         it can not contain the character semicolon ";" 
                         or any control characters. The semicolon will be
                         used to separate the username from the password.
                         The Colon ":" is not allowed in the username 
                         string since it marks the end of the user name
                         string for a CONSAT port.

                         When spaces are entered within the password 
                         portion of the NUI facility request, they are 
                         forwarded to the supervisor, because TYMNET
                         passwords contain spaces as valid password
                         characters. Spaces within the NUI facility
                         but outside the password field will be discarded.

                         The LOGII NUI will either have the above format or
                         the following format:

                                N=ddddnnnnnnnnnn

                         The "=" indicates a Data network identification
                         code (DNIC) and a Network terminal number (NTN) 
                         is being specified instead of the username format.
                         The DNIC will consist of four digits (0-9).
                         The NTN consists of one to ten digits.

                         DEL characters will be acted upon unless they are
                         within the password portion of the NUI.

                  Note:  When using a LOGII CONSAT/PAD, if the NUI is
                         not entered, the OADR is used by the supervisor 
                         to perform the validation process.  The OADR is
                         defined by the MYOADR macro.

                R     - This code indicates the Reverse Charging is requested.
                        The reverse charging facility will not be included
                        in a call request if this facility code is not
                        included in the selection command.  In LOGII the
                        collect call request is subject to network
                        validation.  The destination host interface may
                        choose to reject the call based on other reverse
                        charging criteria.  The default, if R is not entered,

        14.2.2.2  Address Block

             The Address Block can have two different kinds of addresses:

           o  abbreviated address
           o  full address

        abbreviated address

                        - A period (.) will begin each abbreviated address,
                          and must be terminated by an asterisk(*) if
                          Call User Data Field is requested.  
                          A LOGII CONSAT/PAD will allow multiple abbreviated
                          addresses.  Multiple abbreviated addresses are
                          separated by a comma(,).

                          The LOGI abbreviated address parsing differs
                          from the LOGII parsing routine.  In LOGI
                          the address consists of a 1 to 5 digit host
                          number followed, optionally, by a dot (.)
                          and a 1 to 4 digit subaddress (ie..hhhhh[.ssss]).
                          The full address sent to the X.25 is constructed
                          by prefixing the abbreviated address with the
                          default DNIC, and sufficient zeros to insure a
                          six digit host number.

                          Possible LOGI CONSAT/PAD formats are :
                          
                          .hhhhh*
                                5 digits of host number
                          .hhhhh.ssss*
                                5 digits of host number, and 4 digits of
                                subhost number.

                       Example:          .12345.12*

                          12345 is the host number, and 12 is the
                          subhost number.

                          The LOGII abbreviated address parsing will 
                          pass the string after the first period (.)
                          to the Supervisor for validation.  The LOGII
                          CONSAT/PAD does not validate any of the characters
                          following the (.).  Therefore, the user must
                          remember to terminate the Address Block with 
                          an (*) prior to entering CUD.  Otherwise data 
                          entended to be CUD will be passed to the 
                          supervisor as part of the abbreviated address.

                          Possible LOGII CONSAT/PAD formats are :

                                5 digits of host number, and 4 digits of

                          and up to (10) digits of NTN.  The XPRADR flag 
                          does not apply to LOGI CONSAT/PAD.

                          The following description applies for a LOGI
                          CONSAT/PAD or a LOGII CONSAT/PAD with the XPRADR
                          flag set OFF.

                          The full address format is in the form

                                <DNIC><NTN>

                          Example:      31060123456789

                          3106 is the four digit DNIC.
                          0123456789 is the 10-digit Network Terminal Number.

                          The PAD verifies this full address format is at least
                          five digits long, consisting of four(4) DNIC and at
                          least one(1) Host digits.
                                                                  
                          The LOGII CONSAT/PAD full address format would be
                          as follows providing the XPRADR flag is set on in
                          the tymfile.  This transparent full address can be
                          in either of the following two forms:

                                1 <DNIC> <NTN>
                                <LOCAL NTN>
                          
                          These format is treated transparently by the PAD.
                          With the XPRADR flag set ON, this full address can be
                          in any numerical form not defined by Tymnet's
                          numbering plan.

                          The interpretations of the addresses are subject 
                          to the TYMNET Supervisor's knowledge of the
                          specific numbering plan customized for the network.

                         Example 1:     131060123456789

                         1 indicates a special numbering plan is requested.
                         3106 is the four digit DNIC.
                         0123456789 is the 10-digit Network Terminal Number.

              P       - all characters following this delimiter will be
                        sent on the call as (ASCII) user data and will
                        NOT be echoed at the terminal.

                        ci - ASCII characters which make up the call
                             user data, (ie. the ASCII characters in the
                             delimiter P example).

                        Example:  Pc1...c12

              D       - all characters following this delimiter will be
                        sent on the call as (ASCII) user data and will
                        be echoed at the terminal if echo is on (ie. if
                        X.3 parameter 2 is 1).

                        ci - ASCII characters which make up the call
                             user data, (ie. the ASCII characters in the
                             delimiter D example).

                        Example:  Dc1...c12

              H       - all characters following this delimiter will be
                        interpreted as hexadecimal pairs, sent as call
                        user data, and will be echoed at the terminal
                        if echo is on (ie. if X.3 parameter 2 is 1).

                        aibi - hexadecimal digit pairs which makes up  
                               the call user data, (ie. the hexadecimal
                               digit pairs in the delimiter H example).

                        Example:  Ha1b1...a12b12

             A  response  (acknowledgement)  service  signal  (ie.    a  format
        effector which is a  CR/LF) is sent to  the terminal upon receipt  of a
        correct  selection command.   An error  service signal  is sent  to the
        terminal upon receipt of an incorrect selection command (see PAD Servic
        Signals Section).

             A call progress service signal is sent to the terminal at  a later
        time indicating  the success or  failure of the  call set up  (see Call
        Progress Signals Section).

             The port is  in a half  duplex state between  the time at  which a
        selection command is entered and a call connected call progress service
        signal is issued.  Therefore, any characters entered during this period
        are  ignored without  comment (ie.   type ahead  is NOT  allowed during
        command mode login).

                    14.2.3  Clear Command

                              CCITT Command:  CLR
                    TYMNET Extended Command:  CLR_[diag] or CLEar_[diag]


             This command instructs the CONSAT/PAD to clear a call.  The "diag"
        field allows the start-stop mode DTE to specify the clearing diagnostic
        to the remote DTE (if this would be meaningful).

                              CCITT Response: CLR CONF
                    TYMNET Extended Response: CLR CONF text


             The response indicates  that the call  has been cleared.   See the
        "Indication of Error" section for the "text" field contents.

                    TYMNET Extended Command:  RESet_[diag]


             A reset packet  will be sent through  the virtual circuit  if this
        command is entered.  The "diag" field allows a DTE to specify the reset
        diagnostic to the remote DTE.

             An interrupt  packet containing  an one  byte interrupt  user data
        (=01) is sent  to the remote  DTE, if this  command is entered  and the
        remote DTE is a packet  mode DTE.  The interrrupt command is  not valid
        on  a call  to non-packet  mode DTEs  and will  cause an  error service
        signal to be generated.

        14.2.15.1  Code 16 - Character Delete

             This command causes the last character entered by the terminal (in
        data transfer state) to be deleted provided the editing function  is on
        and the  character was  not already forwarded  by the  CONSAT/PAD.  The
        editing function  may always be  used in the  command mode (but  has no
        effect on the selection command).

                      CCITT Command:  Single character with value equal to
                                      CCITT X.3 parameter 16 - character

                     CCITT Response: If X.3 parameter 2 is equal to 1, then
                                     the <Backspace><Space><Backspace> sequence
                                     is echoed. If the character deleted is a
                                     TAB (hex 09), multiple <Backspace> is 
                                     echoed.

           TYMNET Extended Response: same as above



        14.2.15.2  Code 17 - Line Delete

             This command causes  the last line  entered (ie.  contents  of the
        editing buffer) to be deleted.

                     CCITT Command:  Single character with value equal to CCITT
                                     X.3 parameter 17 - line delete code

                                     the line delete character is echoed even
                                     if the edit buffer contained no
                                     characters.
                                     If X.3 parameter 6 is equal to 1 or 5,
                                     "XXX" followed by a CR/LF pair is also
                                     sent.

             This command causes  the last line  entered (ie.  contents  of the
        editing buffer) to be displayed  on the terminal, but has no  effect on
        the selection command.

             The PAD  Help Display brought  up by the  Help Command  is enabled
        only if the PADCOMMANDS macro  is specified in the slot  tymfile.  This
        PADCOMMANDS macro should have the first parmater set as 1 to enable the
        Tymnet Extended Commands.  Otherwise, typing HELP on  aport functioning
        as a PAD port in command mode will only get an error message.

             This command without a value will always provide  some information
        about the CONSAT/PAD command set.

              If the CONSAT/PAD has been configured to provide an expanded help
        listing (default case),  then an integer between  0 and 6  will specify
        which subset of the  CONSAT/PAD command repertoire to  provide detailed
        information for.  If value is not specified then zero (0) is assumed.

             If the CONSAT/PAD has been configured to provide only minimal help
        (which conserves memory) no value is permitted and only one help screen
        is available.

                    14.6.1  Departures of PAD from CCITT

             If the edit buffer is  overfilled in data transfer state,  then it
        is forwarded and a new  edit buffer is started (ie.  no  characters are
        lost).

             If  the  edit  buffer  is overfilled  and  command  state,  then a
        diagnostic message  is displayed  and the buffer  is emptied.   In this
        case, a carriage return must  be typed before the CONSAT will  begin to
        again accept input.

             The selection command will be aborted and the call cleared  if the
        escape  from  data  transfer character  is  entered  during  the period
        between the terminator  of the selection command  (ie.  + or  <CR>) and
        the call connected service signal.





                    14.6.2  Tymnet Enhancements

             When  a call  is  cleared from  data transfer  state  (eg.  logoff
        command issued to a host), the CONSAT/PAD will return to the  mode from
        which the call was placed (ie.  login or command mode).

             The  Tymnet CONSAT/PAD  service signals  provide  more information
        than the standard X.28.  In many cases, a (SYSGEN configurable) message
        follows the service signal type detailing what actually happened.  This
        is particularly useful  in the cases where  a command is  misspelled or
        the command name is different  from that which is entered.  It  is also
        useful if  a command  affecting a  call is  entered but  no call  is in
        progress.

             A new data forwarding value has been added to  allow compatibility
        between  the new  PAD function  of locally  assembling  characters into
        packets  and  the  usual  CONSAT  character-at-a-time  data  forwarding
        method.  The  value 128 means  that data forwarding  will occur  on all
        characters not covered by the preceding value of 127 (eg.   spaces, at-
        signs).

             When data forwarding on each character is desired, X.3 parameter 3
        should be set to 255 and  editing disabled (X.3 parameter 15 set  to 0)
        as editing  would not  be meaningful.   The idle  timer should  also be
        disabled (X.3  parameter 4  set to 0)  as this  function is  not needed
        either when each character is forwarded as soon as it is typed.

                            15 -  CONSAT/PAD SYSGEN MACROS


             The following  list of macros  allows ports to  exhibit "enhanced"
        functions.  These functions include:

           o  building circuits to packet mode interfaces
              (such as X.25 and X.75);
           o  editing command strings and user data;
           o  dynamically altering terminal characteristics.


             The main purpose of these enhanced functions is CONSAT  support of
        the CCITT X.3/X.28/X.29 Recommendations.






                                  15.1  Macro Syntax


             Most of these macros accept a range of ports.  The  generic format
        for these macros is:
         
                     MACRO(A,...,P0,...,Pn)


             The name of the statement may start anywhere on a line.   Only the
        first six characters  are necessary for statement  identification.  The
        open parenthesis  "(" must  immediately follow  the name.   Options and
        port numbers are separated by commas.  The close parenthesis  ")", must
        follow  the last  option  or port  number.   Port numbers,  such  as P0
        through Pn, can  be specified as either  a decimal value, e.g.   1, for
        port #1; or a range of values, e.g.  0-7, for ports #0 through #7.

             NOTE: These functions invoked  by the macros introduced  below are
        only  enabled when  macro  PADRELatedfunctions(ON) is  declared  in the
        configuration file.

                       15.2  Macro:  PADRELatedfunctions(switch)


             This macro  is required  to enable  the CONSAT/PAD  functions, and
        therefore is  the first  PAD macro  discussed.  It  must appear  in the
        timefile ahead  of all  other PAD  macros.  These  capabilities include
        control of the full X.3 set of terminal parameters, support of the X.28
        terminal protocol,  and the  ability of  the CONSAT/PAD  to communicate
        with X.25/X.75 interfaces in packet mode.

        command mode) that  will send a specified  login stream to  the network
        for the specified ports.  It may be invoked repeatedly up to 64 times.

                Syntax:   AUTOCAll(CMDNAME,loginstream,p0,...,pe)
                Default:  none

                CMDNAME = Any alphanumeric character stream to be used
                          as the command name.  This character stream
                          has to be specified in capital letters.

            loginstream = the exact login stream the user would normally
                          be required to type when placing a call while

                               15.4  Macro:  BRKRPL(key)


             The BRKRPL  macro has  been obsoleted.  It  is supported,  but the
        PRNDEF  macro  is preferred.   If  this statement  is  included  in the
        tymfile,  then all  profiles numbering  3 and  greater will  have their
        Tymnet National parameter 103  overwritten with the value  specified by
        this macro.  This value will define a key to emulate the 'break key'.

                Syntax:   BRKRPL(key)
                Default:  Break key = 30
                Range:    0-255 (Decimal value)

                         15.5  Macro:  COMTIMer(min,p0,...,pe)


             This  statement  defines  the value  of  the  command  timer.  The
        command timer is started when the port enters command state and  has no
        calls  in  progress.   The  timer  is  halted  when  a  call  is  being
        established.   On  expiration  of  the  timer,  the  port  is  given  a
        diagnostic message and hung.

                Syntax:   COMTIMer(min,p0,...,pe)
                Default:  0 (off)
                Range:    0 to 255 minutes

                min = timer value, in minutes

                           15.6  Macro:  CUDUSErname(snchar)


             This macro specifies the value which will be used to create a Call
        User Data Field for calls that are placed through our CONSAT/PAD from a
        nonpacket mode  DTE incapable  of constructing  a Call  Request Packet.
        The variable "snchar" is a signed integer that indicates the  number of
        characters to extract from the username and place in the Call User Data
        Field.  A positive value indicates that first snchar character  will be

        extracted  from the  username which  is entered  in  CONSAT/PAD command
        Mode.  A negative value indicates the last character from  the username
        should be extracted.  In both cases, characters will be  extracted from
        left to right.  If the  number of characters from the username  is less
        than the value  which has been defined  by CUDUSE, zeros will  fill the
        remaining  bytes in  the Call  User Data  Field.  The  CUDUSE  macro is
        specified  for  all  ports  which  are  going  to  login  through  this
        interface.

                Syntax:   CUDUSErname(snchar)
                Default:  none

             The  CUG  macro  defines the  Closed  User  Group  Facility switch
        options.

                Syntax:   CUG(submode,inmode,outmode,p0,...pc)
                Default:  0 for above three modes

                             = 0  not subscribed to CUG facility
                     inmode  = 1  subscribed to CUG with incoming access
                             = 0  subscribed to CUG without incoming access
                     outmode = 1  subscribed to CUG with outgoing access

             The CUGROUp  macro specifies the  Interlock Code Mapping  for each
        CUG Index.

                Syntax:   CUGROUp(index,icodea,icodeb,p0,p1,....,pc)
                Default:  none

                index  = CUG index, < 99  (decimal)
                icodea = DNIC portion of the interlock code
                         (0 for national CUG, 2000-7999 for international CUGs)
                icodeb = the rest of the interlock code (decimal)

                      15.10  Macro:  DATABUffer(switch,p0,...,pe)


             The DATABUFFER macro has been obsoleted.  All PAD ports allow data
        editing if X.3 parameter 15 is set to 1.






                    15.11  Macro:  DEFPTY(EVEN/ODD/SPACE/MARK/SAVE)


             This  macro defines  the port  parity type  when ports  do  not go
        through the TID detection process.  It defines the default  parity type
        for all ports at system generation time.  If this macro is not defined,
        the port parity type will  be default to "SAVE" parity  since parameter
        21 defaults to  zero (0) for no  parity reatment.  The  CONSAT/PAD will
        preserve the parity and pass data transparently.

                     15.12  Macro:  EDITBUffersize(size,p0,...,pe)


             The EDITBUFF macro determines the size of the editing  buffer used
        in data transfer mode.  If more than the maximum (size)  characters are
        input while in data transfer mode, editing is enabled (X.3 parameter 15
        is 1), and  no data forwarding conditions  have resulted in  data being
        sent, then  the entire editing  buffer will be  sent and a  new editing
        buffer created.   This will  occur automatically  and without  the port
        being notified.

                Syntax:   EDITBUffersize(size,p0,...,pe)
                Default:  128 characters

                     size - up to 255 characters

                Example: EDITBUffersize(128,5-10)






            15.13  Macro:  INCOMIngcalls(init,p0-pe,host,adr0-adr1,attr,rc)


             This capability  is not inherent  in the PAD;  it will  be present
        only  if  invoked.   This statement  then  enables  incoming  calls and
        specifies   initially   whether  incoming   calls   will   be  answered
        automatically   or  ignored.    Initially,  incoming   calls   will  be
        automatically answered by a port configured with the AUTO option.  Once
        any login  characters are  typed, while in  login mode,  incoming calls
        will be ignored.  The OFF option initializes a port in command  mode to
        reject incoming calls.

             Two commands "RECEIVE" AND "REJECT" can enable or disable incoming
        calls if typed while in command mode.

             This macro can be invoked repeatedly for the same host  to provide
        the capability for several sets of ports.  It invokes the CONSAT ADRPRT
        macro  passing the  last five  arguments.  Please  refer to  the CONSAT
        Configuration for Port Addressing Section for further details.

                Syntax:   INCOMIngcalls(init,p0-pe,host,adr0-adr1,attr,rc)

                init  = OFF     incoming calls must be explicitly answered
                        AUTO    incoming calls answered automatically
                p0-pe = Port range or logical port number
                host  = The host no. which will be used to target these ports
                        (Note:  This also becomes the accounting or origination
                                host for circuits originating on this port,
                                overriding all previous declarations without

                        attribute refers to the condition where the host
                        address is accessed without use of an associated
                        sub-host address.
         
            rc        = The "rc" parameter instructs CONSAT to report the

             The PRFDEF macro defines the Profile Index Number to be associated
        with the specified X.3 Parameter  Values.  Profiles 1 and 2 can  not be
        changed, as they are reserved for CCITT specified profiles (see Profile
        - Initial  X.3 Terminal Parameter  Profile).  Additional  profiles must
        begin with index number 3.  Profile 0 is only valid while in login mode
        and therefore can not be changed either.

             This  macro  defines the parity  type for a  particular port  or a
        set of  ports at  system generation  time.  Once  the  parity   type is
        defined,  it  will be  used  for the  parity  checking  and  generation
        purpose by the CONSAT/PAD.   The port parity type can be changed during
        the TID detection process.  If  this macro is not defined,  the default
        is SAVE parity.






                               15.27  Macro:  PTYERR(n)


             This macro defines the parity  error retry count (default =  3) at
        system generation time.   The value defined in  "n" can range from  1 o
        100  decimal.   If parity  error  retry count  is  exceeded,   the call
        (circuit) will be cleared.  The retry count will be reset  upon receipt
        of good data character within the retry limit.

             If the parity error retry count is set to less than zero  (0) then
        a warning message will be  sent toward user terminal at   slot  tymfile
        assembly time.  The default value  3 will be  assumed for   the  parity
        error retry  count.   If the  parity error retry  count is set  to zero
        (0),  macro "PTYERR" will be disabled, and no call will be  cleared due
        to parity error.

                    15.29  Macro:  SETFLAG(flagname, on/off or 0/1)


             This macro sets  tymfile flags on or  off.  Such flags  are AEQCR,
        CRTID, XPRADR,  and X32584.  SETFLAG(X32584,0)  and SETFLAG(X32584,OFF)
        are the same  as X32584 EQ 0.   However, the user should  always define
        the flags using SETFLAG macros instead of using the equate statement.





                    15.29.1  Flag AEQCR

             The AEQCR flag redefines the A  TID to be identical to the  CR TID
        and is used for certain PAD configurations.





                    15.29.2  Flag CRTID

             The  CRTID  flag  defines  carriage return  (CR)  as  a  valid TID
        character.  This  TID character is  valid only  when PADRELatedfunction
        macro is enabled.  Otherwise,  the Consat rejects the CR  character and
        resends the "please type your TID" message.





                    15.29.3  Flag XPRADR

             The XPRADR flag (default OFF) is a LOGII only flag.  It  should be
        declared  only  when  LOGII  flag  is  ON.   It   enables/disables  the
        transparent  addressing scheme  of CONSAT/PAD.   For the  Supervisor to
        recognize the  Tymnet addressing syntax,  a dash(-) is  required before
        the  <DNIC>  <NTN>.   When  the XPRADR  is  left  to  default  (OFF) or
        specified  as OFF,  the  CONSAT/PAD places  a dash(-)  before  the full
        address  specified  by the  user.   When XPRADR  is  enabled,  then the
        CONSAT/PAD  does not  place a  dash(-) before  the user  specified full
        address.

             When a PAD user  enters the - <DNIC>  <NTN> with this flag  set to
        OFF in the selection PAD command, the PAD will verify the  full address
        is  comprised of  digits (0-9)  with at  least four  DNIC and  one host
        digit.  The CONSAT/PAD will then send it to the Supervisor in  the form
        of  - <DNIC> <NTN>, inserting the dash(-) before the DNIC.

             If the flag is set to  ON, whatever the PAD users types  after the
        dash(-),  ie.  - <string>,  the  <string> is  sent  to  the Supervisor.

        CONSAT will not insert a dash(-) before the address, but will  check to
        see that all address characters are digits (0-9).

             Following is the  mapping of the login  string entered by  the PAD
        user and the string that CONSAT/PAD sends out to the Supervisor.

          XPRADR is OFF

                  User Enters           Login String to the Supervisor

               - <DNIC> <NTN>                - <DNIC> <NTN>
               

          XPRADR is ON

                  User Enters           Login String to the Supervisor

               - <full adr>                  <full adr>
               

             Setting this flag to ON  or OFF does not affect the  processing of
        the abbreviated address.  CONSAT/PAD will send the whole string  to the
        Supervisor the way it is entered by the user.





                    15.29.4  Flag X32584

             The  1984 CCITT  recommendation X.29  defines how  the  PAD should
        respond to a valid "set",  "read", or "set and read" PAD  message.  The
        CONSAT/PAD's response to a valid  "read" or "set and read"  PAD message
        will contain a list  of parameter references and their  current values.
        The current TYMNET X.25 interface  can only support X.3 parameter  1 to
        18  but  CONSAT/PAD can  support  parameter  1 to  22.   To  avoid this
        incompatibility, flag X32584 flag (default OFF) can be used.

             If this flag is ON, the CONSAT/PAD will respond to a  valid "read"
        PAD  message with  all parameter  references (1-22)  and  their current
        values.  If this flag is set  to OFF, the CONSAT/PAD will respond  to a
        valid "read" PAD message with 18 parameter (1-18) only.

             The UUNUMB macro provides implementation of the National Numbering
        Plan for the Datapak Network.  It permits the substitution of a calling
        address with  the Universal  User Number (UUN)  for a  non-numeric user
        name.

                Syntax: UUNUMB(on/off)

                    15.31  SWBT Numbering Plan Special Requirements


             This  section describes  the special  requirements for  the CONSAT
        operating in the SWBT  network.  SWBT numbering plan defines  the X.121
        destination full address to be in two different formats.

                     SWBT                       TYMNET
               ----------------             ------------

                1 <DNIC> <NTN>               - <DNIC> <NTN>
                <LOCAL NTN>                  none


             The PAD supports either type of full addresses.  However, only one
        type is supported at a time  by the PAD.  The type is specified  in the
        slot tymfile using the XPRADR flag.

             The <LOCAL  NTN> is composed  of at least  6 decimal  digits.  The
        first digit must be greater than 1 in order for it to be different from
        the 1 DNIC NTN format. However the PAD does not verify there is at leat
        6 characters, the  first being one(1).  The  Pad only verifies  that at
        lease five decimal digits are entered by the user.





                    15.31.1  PAD Login Procedure

             The call  set up  procedures do not  change for  SWBT environment.
        The user enters in the destination address block the 1 <DNIC> <NTN>, or
        the  the <LOCAL  NTN>.  The  PAD sends  the address  to  the Supervisor
        without any conversion.

             The abbreviated address processing is the same for both the TYMENT
        or  SWBT environment.   The format  is described  in the  address block
        format enhancements under Selection PAD Command Signal section.





                    15.31.2  System Generation Requirements

             In order to  enable the SWBT  numbering plan, the  CONSAT/PAD slot
        must be configured  by using the  system generation macro  SETFLAG, and
        the flag XPRADR must be set to ON.  A brief example of the usage  is as
        follows:

                SETFLAG(XPRADR,ON)


             Note  that this  flag  does not  affect the  regular  CONSAT login
        process, which does not use the X.28 call set up procedures.  It is PAD
        specific.

                         APPENDIX II.   ISIS-Specific features



             Certain CONSAT features are environment specific.  Since these are
        of interest to users, they are described here.






                               II-1  Front Panel Display


             The CONSAT generates a 4-digit display for the Engine Front Panel.
        The contents of the display will vary according to certain options.





                    II-1.1  Configuration Errors

             Certain configuration errors may not be detected until  the CONSAT
        is executing.  If this is so, the display is fixed (see Figure II.1.).

                       Figure II.1.  Configuration Error Display

                --------+-------+-------+--------
                | TYPE  |     Device Number     |
                --------+-------+-------+--------

               Where:


               TYPE    Device  Type  -- unable  to  locate  a configured
                       device of this type:

                1       ASYNC Group
                2       Printer
                3       SIO Port

               Number  The  number of  the first  such device  not found
                       (e.g. if configured for  3 SIO ports, and  only 2
                       are available, the display would show "3002".

                    II-1.2  Normal Display

             The  "normal"  display  presents  information  on  usage.   It  is
        distinguished from  the configuration error  by "flashing"  (see Figure
        II.2.).

                         Figure II.2.  "Normal" Error Display

                |F|    USE      |  No. of Ports |
                --------+-------+-------+--------

               Where:


               F       Flashing Bit -- Flashes on and off.

               USE     Displays  the average  (averaged over  16 cycles)
                       interval between iterations of the EXEC  loop, in
                       units of Clock-Ticks.

               No.     The Number of ISIS ports currently active.





                    II-1.3  CPS Display

             The CONSAT  may be set  to monitor ASYNC  Characters/Second (CPS).
        In that case, the normal display alternates with the CPS  display, with
        an elapsed interval of 1.7 seconds for each type of display.

             The  CPS  display  is  further  divided  into  "short"  and "long"
        measurements:

                  T (seconds)
                 0.0    normal display
                 1.7    "short" display
                 3.4    normal display
                 5.1    "short" display
                 6.8    normal display
                ....
                23.8    normal display
                25.5    "long" display ("blinks")
                27.2    normal display (repeat sequence)

             The  "short"  display  presents  the  CPS  transfered  during  the
        previous 3.4 seconds.

             The  "long"  display  presents  the  CPS  transferred  during  the
        previous  54.4  second  interval.   This  display  "blinks" (alternates

        displays.






                              II-2  DDT Control Features


             In ISIS-DDT, the "?STAT" command connects the DDT user to  an ISIS
        CONSAT control process.

            Oxxxx   - displays the ORING for xxxx (hex) seconds.
            Bxxxx   - displays both rings for xxxx (hex) seconds.

             The selected ring is displayed from the beginning of the ring upto
        the current fill  pointer along with any  future activity for  the next
        xxxx hex seconds.  This monitoring routine is exitted by  either typing
        any key or after timer expired.  The xxxx value field is  optional.  If
        it  is not  included then  the  ring are  displayed up  to  the present

                    II-2.26  USAGE

             This command displays the general statistics on CONSAT Port Usage.
        It is based on the number  of Async ports that have been in  use during
        the  past 24  hours.   Information from  the CONSAT  slot  includes the
        following:

           (1) Average Maximum Async Port(s) in use;
           (2) Average Minimum Async Port(s) in use;
           (3) Average Mean    Async Port(s) in use;
           (4) A Simple Standard Deviation.


             With the statistics on CONSAT port usage process enabled, i.e. the
        SETFLAG(MX.ACC,ON)  is  declared,  the  user  should  be  aware  of the
        following important notes:

           (1) It is very CPU time consuming;
           (2) It is very memory occupied;
           (3) It is for Async ports only,
              with the exclusion of PVC ports.

             CRAT is the crash table  entry, read 4C bytes will dump  the crash
        table.  The data storages are assigned as follows:

        CRSHCT  HS      1       :crash count...how many times crashed
        CRASHC  HS      1       :crash code (initiated to manual restart)

        CRXREG  HS      20      :registers at time of crash (registers 0 - 15)
        CRTIME  WS      1       :real time of crash (GMT)

             The tymfile  option SETFLAG(CRSTOP,ON)  may be  set to  enable the
        crash routine to be executed once.  The default is OFF.

             The tymfile option NCRSAV defines the number of crash tables to be
        saved.  It will be set to 3 by default. Reading 4C bytes  from location
        CRAT will dump the last crash table and reading 4C bytes  from location
        CRAT+50 (real time of crash  included, so 4 bytes is  incremented) will
        dump the previous crash table and so on.

             The tymfile  option EXCRSH may  be set  to 0 or  1. It  allows the
        extended crash  processing to  be executed. EXCRSH  is defaulted  to 1.
        Under this option, another tymfile option  CHIST may be set to 0  or 1.
        If 1, the I/O ring information at the crash time will be saved. Reading
        ORSIZE+4  bytes from  location  SVORPT will  dump 2  halfword  of Oring
        pointer and all Oring information. Reading IRSIZE+4 bytes from location
        SVIRPT will dump 2 halfword of Iring pointer and all Iring information.

             Although this example illustrates the results of a  device failure
        at the terminating  end, there are many  other possible causes  for the
        failure of a network circuit to complete.  Some of these are SPACE from
        originating device,  CONSAT failure  at either  end, bad  PVC username,
        terminating port already connected, and so on.

             If  the network  circuit  is zapped  for any  reason,  both CONSAT
        connections will supply SPACE  to the devices.  Also, if  either device
        resumes sending SPACE, the network connection will be zapped.

                              bb = one byte of data in hex.

        Enchancement - Control Character to Restore Full-Duplex    May 10, 1988






        APPENDIX VI.   Enchancement - Control Character to Restore Full-Duplex



             This enchancement allows CONSAT to revert to full-duplex operation
        on receipt of designated control character (control-E) at login.

           1. If user has entered half-duplex mode via 
              (possibly accidental) insertion of control-H at login.

           2. Or leaves a half-duplex session for a full-duplex one.


             The  user  will be  able  to  return to  full-duplex  by  means of
        entering the control-E character within the following fields:

             LOGI LOGIN  - within the "username:host#" field
             LOGII LOGIN - within the "username:destination-list" field


             This feature only takes effect at the initial login stage.  Once a
        terminater  is encountered  by the  CONSAT login  handler,  the circuit
        state is decided.  It can only be changed by rebooting the  terminal to
        start over the login process.

             The  control-E  character is  not  sent to  the  Supervisor.  LOGI
        Supervisor memorizes the half-duplex  status of a circuit when  a reset
        character is entered.  However, LOGII Supervisor clears the half-duplex
        setting when encounters the ESC character.

                  APPENDIX VII.   LOGII CONSAT Login Status Messages



             This section contains the new login status messages  resulted from
        CONSAT  LOGII logins.   Ports functioning  as CONSAT  ports  and  ports
        functionning as PAD ports have different sets of login status messages.
        Please  refer to  PAD LOGII  Service Signals  for the  PAD  LOGII Login
        Status Messages.

             The LOGII CONSAT  port login status  messages can be  grouped into
        five categories:

           Group 1. Node Code indicates that a Dispatcher port
                    number cannot be provided.

           Group 2. Node Code rejects the circuit request due
                    to logon error or network problem.

           Group 3. Supervisor rejects the circuit request due
                    to logon error or network problem.

           Group 4. Supervisor detects login error and prompt
                    for correct information or new login string.

           Group 5. CONSAT detected error condition during 
                    login.


             Each  group contains  several messages.   LOGII GED  describes the
        first four groups of messages in detail.  Each message has  a different
        code followed by its explanation.   Since the  user might not  know the
        TYMNET network  terminology, CONSAT  does not  display the  messages as
        described in the LOGII GED (see document LG2GED.DOC).

             Messages in this group are resulted from the Node Code's not being
        able to provide a Dispatcher port.  After any of the following  message
        is displayed, the  port will be disconnected.   User has to  reboot the
        terminal to get the "please log in:" prompt again for another login.

                APPENDIX VIII.   LOGII PAD Logon Status Service Signals



             This Logon Status Handler  displays X.28 service signals  based on
        the interpretation of  MOs 04, 24, 27  and 29.  The routine  checks for
        lower and upper table limits.  If either limit is reached,  unk (TYMNET
        message number 412) is displayed as the clear cause.  The  .FTBUF (from
        terminal buffer), the .FEDBF (from edit buffer) and the  .LGBUF (logger
        buffer) are  emptied.  The  port is  cleaned up  and the  clear service
        signal is then sent followed by the PAD prompt if parameter 6 is set to
        5.  If the status in register 9 indicates an invalid logon  attempt was
        made by  the user  then it  is counted.   When a  maximum of  3 invalid
        attempts are  made then  TYMNET message number  163 (command  state re-
        entry  count exceeded...disconnecting)  is  displayed and  the  user is
        dropped.

             This Logon Status Handler  displays X.28 service signals  based on
        the value of register 9.  If a zero status is contained in  register 9,
        it  means continue.   The  CONSAT needs  to  send the  password  to the
        Network so the PAD does not handle this status, but returns  control to
        the CONSAT.   If a non-zero  status is contained  in the  register, the
        routine checks for  lower and upper table  limits.  If either  limit is
        reached,  unk (TYMNET  message number  412) is  displayed as  the clear
        cause.  The .FTBUF  (from terminal buffer),  and the .FEDBF  (from edit
        buffer) are  emptied.  The  port is  cleaned up  and the  clear service
        signal is then sent followed by the PAD prompt if parameter 6 is set to
        5.  If the status in register 9 indicates an invalid logon  attempt was
        made by  the user  then it  is counted.   When a  maximum of  3 invalid
        attempts are made then the user is dropped, via the port being hung.

             Notes:
             1. The possible values of the escape from data transfer character
                as specified by "n" are:
                     0       - escape from data transfer impossible
                     1       - 1/0(DLE) is the escape character
                     2-31    - the ASCII character having this value is the
                               escape character (but only when the interface is
                               configured in the TYMNET Extended mode of
                               operation)
                     32-127  - the ASCII character having this value is the
                               escape character
                Control-A and NUL can never be escape characters.

             2. The data forwarding characters corresponding to values of "n"
                are:
                     0       - no data forwarding characters
                     1       - alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9)
                     2       - CR
                     4       - ESC, BEL, ENQ, ACK
                     8       - DEL, CAN, DC2
                    16       - ETX, EOT
                    32       - HT, LF, VT, FF
                    64       - all other characters not in columns 0 and 1 not
                               included in the above
                   128       - all other characters not included in the above
           
                A combination of  these values may be  used in place of  a
                single value  as shown  in Table  1/X.3  (eg. 3  means all
                alphanumeric characters and carriage return).

             3. Service signals are sent to the DTE based on the values:
                     0       - no service signals
                     1       - service signals other than the prompt
                     4       - prompt service signal

                     A combination of these values may also be used.

             4. The result of a break character being received from the
                terminal is determined by the following values of "n":
                     0       - no action

                     1       - send interrupt packet
                     2       - reset
                     4       - send Indication of Break (X.29 or break
                               message)
                     8       - escape from data transfer state
                    16       - discard output to the DTE

                A combination of  these values may be  used in place of  a
                single value as shown in Table 1/X.3.

             5. The terminal speed may be further divided into input and output
                speeds using TYMNET National parameters 5 and 6.

             6. Valid terminal rates as specified by "n" are CCITT
                representations of actual terminal speeds as listed below.

                     Actual Speed            CCITT Representation
                     110 bits/s                       0
                     300 bits/s                       2
                    1200 bits/s                       3
                    2400 bits/s                      12
                    4800 bits/s                      13
                    9600 bits/s                      14

             7. Multiple values are used to indicate in which direction(s) the
                linefeeds are to be inserted (combinations of values may also
                be used).
                     0 - no linefeed insertion
                     1 - after each carriage return in the data stream to the
                         DTE
                     2 - after each carriage return in the data stream from the
                         DTE
                     4 - after each carriage return in the echo to the DTE

             The following profiles are currently  supported by the  CONSAT.  A
        "T"   in  the   value   field means   that  the   parameter   value  is
        determined by the terminal identifier  (TID) entered when  contact with
        the  CONSAT is   first  made  (ie.   by the  service   request signal).
        The TID may  be the same as was used  for the unenhanced CONSAT.

             As the  1984 CCITT Recommendation  X.3 specifies, PAD  provides an
        editing function for the start-stop mode DTE users in both  PAD command
        state  and data transfer state.  This  editing  function contains three
        basic operations;  (1) Character delete,  (2) Line delete, and (3) Line
        display.   The editing function is always available when the user is in
        PAD command state, and the use of the  editing  function  in   the data
        transfer  state is  determined  by parameter  15.         The   editing
        function  support  of  the    CONSAT/PAD   is implemented to  allow the
        user to select the following:
            
             (1) Whether or not  PAD service signals are  transmitted
                 to the user terminal; and
         
             (2) in what format PAD service signals should be used. 
         

             The PAD editing functions  are governed by parameters 6,  15,  16,
        17, 18. Herein, we discuss only the details of parameter 19 in terms of
        using  editing PAD  service signals.    Editing PAD  service  signal is
        available only when  parameter 6 is set to a non-zero value.

             When   parameter  6   is  set  to equal  or greater  than  1,  the
        following combinations of  conditions will be   applied to the   use of
        Editing PAD service signals in compliance with 1984 X.3:

             (1) Parameter 19 is set to zero (0). 
                 No  editing PAD service signals will be provided in both 
                 command and data transfer state.

             (2) Parameter 15 is set to zero (0) and parameter 19 is  set 
                 to greater than 1. 
                 Editing PAD service signals shall be provided in command
                 state only.

             (3) Parameter  15  is  set to 1 and parameter 19 is  set  to 
                 greater  than 1.
                 Editing PAD service signals shall be provided  for  both 
                 command and data transfer states.

        allowed   in   call   set-up  command   mode.   The   character  delete
        function is allowed in general,  but it will be prohibited in  the user
        password field and the private  call user data field which  is preceded
        by character  "P".  Therefore, the   editing  PAD  service  signals are
        not applicable to these situations.






                            XI-2  Echo Mask - Reference 20


             The   CONSAT/PAD    provides   the    function    that    receives
        character(s) from the user terminal and echoes them back  to   the user
        terminal.  These  characters  are  also  checked  for  other purposes.

             In  addition to the CONSAT/PAD "Echoing"  capability,   users will
        be allowed to select  defined sets of character(s)  received  from  the
        terminal  to be "MASKED" and not echoed  back  to  the terminal.

             Echo  of  character(s) is  determined  by X.3  parameter   2.  And
        character(s) "echo mask"  is determined by  X.3 parameter 20.   This is
        described in Table below.

             (1) User selection of the character(s) echo and echo mask is
                 applied to both command state and data transfer state.
         
             (2) Parameter 20  applies only when parameter 2 is set to 1. 
                 If parameter 2 is set to zero (0),  CONSAT/PAD will  not 
                 echo  any  received  character(s) in  any state, at  any
                 time. 
             
             (3) X-ON and X-OFF  are  not  echoed  if parameter 5, 12, or
                 22 is set to a non-zero (0) value. 
             
             (4) If the parameter 20 is set to 64, there will be  no echo
                 of editing characters  as  designed by parameter 16, 17,
                 and 18.  The setting of paramter 15 is ignored.







                         XI-3  Parity Treatment - Reference 21


             The   enhanced   CONSAT/PAD  will  provide  the  functionality  of
        parity  checking  and parity  generation in accordance  with   1984 X.3
        reference 21.   The CONSAT/PAD   will  transmit and expect  to  receive
        8-bit character(s)  to  and/or from the user terminal in  both  command
        state and data  transfer state.    When  the  value of parameter  21 is
        set to  0,  the  CONSAT/PAD will  not perform  the parity  checking and
        generation  process.  It  will  only inspect  the first seven  bits and
        will  not  take   into account the eighth  bit (the last  bit preceding
        the stop element.) The result  of setting parameter 21 is  described in
        Table below:

                    XI-3.1  Parity Detection

             Parity  detection  can be  performed  based on  the  TID (Terminal
        Identifier) at the  user login time.  Three perspective TID(s)  will be
        used to represent the parity types. Thus,

             TID   character "A"  will  be used  to indicate  that  no  "parity
        treatment"  is  required.  This  is  actually the  "Save"  parity.  The
        CONSAT/PAD will preserve the parity and pass data  transparently.   TID
        character "K" will  be  used  to  detect "Even" or "Odd"  parity.   TID
        character "O" will  be  used  to detect  "Space"     or  "Mark"  parity
        since it  has been already  used for "Space"   parity treatment  by the
        CONSAT  version  6.    A  carriage  return  <CR>  has  been  originally
        designated as  a speed detection character and is used  to  trigger the
        "Terminal Identifier Message" to be output toward the user terminal.

             In addition, a carriage return  <CR> can be used as  a   valid TID
        character if the flag  "CRTID" is set to  ON.  However, it will  not be
        used for the parity detection purpose for the  PAD  parity treatment.

             Macro  "DEFPTY"  provides   a  global  parity setting.   Users may
        define,  at   the  slot   level,   default parity  type  for  all ports
        during system  generation time.

             Macro "PRTPAR" allows the user  to specify  the parity type on the
        port basis at  system  generation time.

             Macro "PRTPAR"  overrides the port  default  parity type specified
        by the macro "DEFPTY".

             The type of parity detected by the TID character(s) at  login time
        will  override the port parity type defined by  the   system generation
        macros "DEFPTY" and "PRTPAR".   Finally, the parity setting for  a port
        can be determined in the following priority order:
           
                (1) TID character(s) at user login time;
                (2) Port parity type specified by the macro "PRTPAR"; 
                (3) The global default parity type specified by the macro
                    "DEFPTY".

                    XI-3.2  Parity Checking

             Data  character(s)  received  by the  CONSAT/PAD  will  be checked
        against  the  parity type  to  ensure  error  free  transmission.  If a
        parity error occurs,   a PAD parity error  service signal will  be sent
        toward the user  terminal.  Users are  allowed a  specified  numbers of
        parity error retries.  If the parity error retry count is exceeded, the
        call will be cleared.

                  CCITT currently has not defined the format of the  PAD parity
        error   service   signal.   The  Tymnet  extended   PAD   parity  error
        service  signal  will be  provided.  Thus,             The character0/7
        (BEL) will be sent.

                  Received character (from  start-stop DTE) will not  be echoed
        if a parity error has been detected.

                  The PAD parity error  service signal will be   provided  when
        parity checking is in place and parameter 6 is set to a non-zero value.

             Macro "PTYERR(n)" allows the  user to specify the number of parity
        error occurrences allowed  during each call.





                    XI-3.3  Parity Generation

             Parity generation process will be performed upon receipt   of data
        character(s) from  the network (host).   The data  characters  will  be
        mapped  to the  correct parity  type,  and  passed on  toward  the user
        terminal.






                            XI-4  Page Wait - Reference 22


             The enhanced CONSAT/PAD will be able to suspend transmission after
        a  specified  number of linefeed  character(s)  have   been transmitted
        toward the user terminal.   This  function  is  much like  data traffic
        "flow   control".  However,   it   is   being   done  by   the  "paging
        mechanism".   For example,  if  "page wait" function (parameter  22) is
        enabled,  data character(s)   will be  transmitted from  the CONSAT/PAD
        toward  the  user  terminal  one   page  at a  time.  The  size   of  a
        page  is  determined   by   the  number   of  linefeed(s)   which  have
        been transmitted  by  the  CONSAT/PAD.  Definition of  the   number  of
        linefeed(s)  is  user  selectable in order to trigger  the  "page wait"

             When parameter 13 is  set  to a non-zero value,  the count  of the
        number  of  linefeed(s) will  also  include the  linefeed(s)  which are
        generated by the function of parameter 13.

             At the end of each  page of data transmission, a "page   wait" PAD
        service signal will be sent to the user terminal if parameter 6  is not
        set to zero  (0). And no further  data will be transmitted  toward  the
        user  terminal until the  "page  wait"  condition  is  cancelled.  Upon
        receiving  the cancellation  of "page wait"  condition,  the CONSAT/PAD
        will  transmit  a  format  effector  [x]  and  resume  the  normal data
        transmission.  The cancellation of "page wait" condition  is determined
        when any of following occurs:
         
           1.
            (a) On  receipt  of any condition that resets the  count  of 
                linefeeds (See (2) Page wait reset conditions);
          
            (b) On  receipt  of  the "page wait" cancellation  character
                (X-ON); or
         
            (c) On resetting parameter 22 to zero (0).

             PAD  service  signals,  for all  login  status  received  from the
        network, will be per the 1984 CCITT X.28 Recommendation.  There are two
        logon status  handlers in the  PAD.  One for  LOGII status and  one for
        LOGI.  Both  would display a  clear message, because  the call  will be
        sent, followed by a space and 2 or 3 characters representing  the clear
        cause code.  After the clear cause is displayed, the cursor will  be at
        the beginning of a new line.

            Example:

            With PAD prompt:

              pad>Nusername;psw-3106000777
              clr dte

              pad>_

            Without PAD prompt:

              Nusername;psw-3106000777
              _


             Note: blank line between clear message and prompt due  to carriage
        return line feed preceding prompt. Underscore "_" is cursor.

             The following  is the TYMNET  message numbers associated  with the
        CCITT clear cause.
