                      3.  SLOT REPORTS


This section describes the new or updated TMCS Slot Reports
for the specific products.  The messages under each product
name are listed according to ISIS event number.  Each entry
includes the message output, the event number, and a full
explanation of the message.



3.1  3270 Host Interface


These messages report the abnormal events that occur on the
3270 Host (PBH) Interface.  The values common to these mes-
sages are:

3.3  E-Bus


These messages report the abnormal events that occur on E-
Bus (EBUS) Interface.  The values common to these messages
are:


node#     node reporting the error
slot#     slot number
EBUS      product name for an E-BUS slot
count     crash count

node# NODE REPORT FROM SLOT slot# EBUS CRASH, COUNT: count
TYPE: type <ISIS 01>

   Event number: ISIS 01

   This indicates that the slot containing the E-BUS Inter-
   face crashed.  The crash type is reported by the slot,
   that identifies the reason for the crash. The crash type
   can be either a standard slot crash type or one of the
   following types specific to the E-BUS interface:

node# NODE REPORT FROM SLOT slot# EBUS, HOST SAD  VALUE:
cccc <ISIS 10>

   Event number: ISIS 10

   The PDP-10 host is reporting an unsatisfactory (host sad)
   condition.  The value cccc is a hexadecimal representa-
   tion of 16 bits (sad bits) that identify the problem con-
   dition.  Multiple bits can be on (set to 1) at one time.
   When this occurs, the value shown equals the sum of the
   values that follows.  For example, a cccc value of 0012
   indicates that both the 0010 and 0002 values were return.

   The possible values are as follows:

         0001      no set operation done
         0002      operator action needed
         0004      message to detached job
