                                 1 -  CONSAT overview


             This document is a  preliminary ERS for CONSAT version  6.  During
        the prerelease testing  of version 6,  this document will  be reviewed,
        revised and  finalized.  The  final ERS will  be available  for general
        distribution at  the same  time that  CONSAT version  6 is  released to
        baseline.

             Major CONSAT changes after version 3.05 consist of the following:

        Version 4.00:  Added X.28 Packet Assembler/Disassembler (PAD) support.
                       Added HD202 support using line turnaround characters.
                       Deleted LISA voice terminal support.

        Version 4.01:  Added space parity terminal support.

        Version 4.02:  Added polarity key signalling Telex support (Speedlink).

        Version 4.03:  Added public outdial support.

        Version 5.00:  Added an extended DDT consat operation monitor (COM).
                        - network console access is supported.
                        - port status and data in the async rings, buffers,
                          and ISIS rings can be monitored by an operator
                          (access to the PDP-10 nib is not needed).

        Version 6.01:  Added IIX dialect for S-mode terminal support.
                       Changed crash codes (see ERS appendices).
                        - Added crash codes for problem visibility.
                        - Renumbered duplicate crash codes.
                       Integrated the Consat and PAD.
                        - PAD mode ports and Consat mode ports can
                          co-exist in same slot as long as certain IIX
                          limitations are observed (see PAD restrictions).
                        - PAD supports only the PVC feature AID in
                          X.28 PAD command mode.
                        - PAD supports all PVC and MPVC features
                          in Consat login mode.
                        - PAD supports port addressibility in both
                          Consat login mode and X.28 PAD command mode.
                        - PAD now correctly supports all 1980 X.3 parameters.
                       Known PAD restrictions in version 6.01
                        - PAD supports full-duplex ASCII devices,
                          but not half-duplex or non-ASCII devices.
                        - PAD supports async ports, but not SIO ports.
                        - Pad command mode calls to IIX-capable, non-X.25 Hosts
                          are not supported.

                       host number is reported to the Supervisor as "SHUT" due
                       to changes in the host number processing by
                       the Supervisor.  Please refer to the X and Y files

                        2 -  Configuration and Code Generation


             Each time a CONSAT (CONsolidated tymSAT) is generated, a number of
        files must be assembled  together in the proper order.   The particular
        set of files  used is environment dependent,  but a number  of elements
        are common to all environments.

                   Generally, the  following five files  should be  included in
        the command  file (NDxxxx.Css)  in order to  generate a  CONSAT nibfile
        (NDxxxx.Nss):

                1.  Initialization file            (ISCSvv.Irr)
                2.  Configuration file             (NDxxxx.Tss)
                3.  CONSAT Source file             (ISCSvv.Rrr)
                4.  Patch file                     (ISCSvv.Prr)
                5.  File name for expected nibfile (NDxxxx.Nss)

                where:  xxxx  - node number
                        ss    - slot number
                        vv    - version number
                        rr    - revision level






                          2.1  Slot Command File - NDxxxx.Css


             This  file  is used  to  help generate  the  nib file  in  one NAD
        command.

                                   ;x    NDxxxx.Css


             See code  release information  for a sample  command file  of each
        version.   Sample  command  files  for  released  CONSAT  versions  are
        available in the  source code directory as  (SOURCE)ISCSvv.Crr.  Sample
        command  files  for  betatest  CONSAT  versions  are  available  in the
        betatest code directory as (BETATEST)ISCSvv.Crr.

             The following is an example of a betatest command file:

                         2.2  Initialization file - ISCSvv.Irr


             The first file assembled performs general initialization.

             The major function  provided is to create  a number of  Macros and
        symbolic parameters, used in the succeeding files.

             The initialization  file defines a  number of macros,  used within
        the configuration option file.  While these macros have  some (limited)
        ability  to  detect  syntax  and  gross  configuration  errors,  it  is
        necessary to have an  additional process to permit the  verification of
        cross-referencing options.

             As  the first  part of  the CONSAT  source file  (ISCSvv.Rrr), the
        verification process is  performed immediately after  the configuration
        option file, to permit the immediate detection (and  subsequent repair)
        of configuration  errors at  the beginning  of the  generation process,
        before a great deal of time is spent in fruitless effort.






                         2.3  Configuration File - NDxxxx.Tss


             The following is a  complete Configuration Option File  (or called
        Tymfile).   Sample parameter  files  for released  Consat  versions are
        available  in the  source directory  as (SOURCE)ISCSvv.Trr,  and sample
        parameter  files  for betatest  Consat  versions are  available  in the
        betatest code  directory as  (BETATEST)ISCSvv.Trr.  See  later sections
        for definition and detail information.

                         3 -  Configuration file - NDxxxx.Tss


             This  file   specifies  the  environment,   general  configuration
        parameters,  and  particular  constraints  on  the  configuration.  See
        section 2.3 for a sample file.






                               3.1  Ranging Macro Syntax


             A number of the macros to  be invoked are of the general  class of
        Ranging Macros.  These all have similar functions and  invocation form,
        so the form of parameters will be discussed here, and  referenced where
        ever appropriate.

             Each ranging macro accepts a variable number of parameters  (up to
        16) and is  symbolically represented by MACRONAME(RANGE  1,...RANGE N).
        Each  of these  range parameters  is of  identical format,  and  may be
        specified in any desired order.  Null parameters are allowed,  and will
        be ignored.

             Each parameter specified may be of two forms: simple or range.

             A simple parameter consists  of a simple decimal  number, normally
        specifying a  particular port number  unless otherwise  declared.  This
        number must be a  valid port number.  Later exception  macro parameters
        are subject to the range defined in the DECLARE macro.

             A range parameter is of the form "N1-N2", where N1 and N2 are both
        decimal numbers,  and each  subject to the  same constraints  as simple
        range parameters.   N2 must be  greater than N1;  if not,  a diagnostic
        message is printed and the parameter ignored.


                                        EXAMPLE

             The  following macro  invocation would  specify the  condition for
        ports 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8:

                RMACRO(1,2,3,6-8)

               NOTE:   It would have been simpler to write "1-3" instead
                       of "1,2,3".

             Ranging macros may be  invoked repeatedly if necessary  to specify
        more than 16 parameters.






                               3.2  Text Argument Syntax


             Certain macros  specify that  an argument be  text.  This  text is
        subject to certain rules - some characters may not explicitly appear in
        the   text  string,   and  others   may  appear   only   under  certain
        circumstances.





                    3.2.1  Forbidden Characters

             The following characters may not appear; instead, these characters
        must be represented in an extended form:

                "8D     Carriage Return
                "8A     Line Feed
                "AF     slash ('/')
                "BA     colon (':')
                "BB     semicolon (';')

               NOTE:   While not forbidden, the NULL character  ("00) is
                       used  internally  to  signal the  end  of  a text
                       string.  Since text  beyond this point  cannot be
                       output, the use of NULL should be avoided.





                    3.2.2  Privileged Characters

             The  following characters  may appear  only if  escaped (preceeded
        with an accent grave '`').  These are:


            `   accent grave
            "   double quote
            ,   comma
            (   left parenthesis
            )   right parenthesis

                             3.3  General CONSAT features


             The following  collection of macros  are used to  declare specific
        capabilities for the general configuration.





                    3.3.1  Macro:  DECLARE(name,number)

             The first elements of the file must be configuration declarations.
        The DECLARE macro is used for this purpose.  NAME is selected  from the
        following list:


           ASYNC -      Async ports.
           SIO -        SIO ports.
           MPVC -       Multiplexed PVC ports.
           PRINT -      Printers.

             The  Macro  may  be  invoked  repeatedly,  once  for  each  set of
        configuration attributes.  However,  these must all be  declared BEFORE
        any  exception  macros  are  declared  (the  first  invocation  of  any
        exception macro  "fixes" the configuration;  thereafter, this  macro is
        invalid, and will generate a diagnostic!).

             NUMBER is a decimal number; it specifies the number of elements of
        the specified type.

                        SAMPLE USAGE:

                DECLARE(ASYNC,32)       :declare the configuration to
                                        :    contain 32d ASYNC ports





                    3.3.2  Macro:  SHOWME(level)

             A configuration table  may be typed at  the end of  assembly.  The
        control of the contents is dependent on the LEVEL number requested.  If
        0,   no  table   is   printed.   Successively   larger   numbers  cause
        correspondingly greater quantities  of information (greater  detail) to
        be printed.

             If not specified, the default  value is 1.  This causes  the table
        to  contain minimal  information, such  as version  numbers  and device
        ranges.

                    3.3.3  Macro:  LOCATION(node,slot)

             Declares the target NODE and SLOT numbers.  Node is octal; Slot is
        decimal.   These values  are used  for identification  in  listings and
        configuration table.  The actual node and port numbers used when loaded
        are provided externally by ISIS.





                    3.3.4  Macro:  ACHOST(number)

             Declares an origination-only host number NUMBER (decimal).

             This declaration is required!

             The last such declaration is the default used for all unsubscribed
        ports and is reported to the Supervisor with the status of  "SHUT".  If
        the accounting host number is shared by other function as a destination

        function, ie. OUTDIAL, or PAD with incoming call.

             Ports may  be subscribed  via the  use of  AHRNG, SHRNG,  or MHRNG
        macros, below.





                    3.3.5  Macro:  AHRNG(port range 1,...port range n)

             This ranging  macro subscribes  the ASYNC  ports specified  to the
        last ACHOST declaration value.





                    3.3.6  Macro:  SHRNG(port range 1,...port range n)

                    3.3.7  Macro:  MHRNG(port range 1,...port range n)

             This ranging macro subscribes the MPVC ports specified to the last
        ACHOST declaration value.





                    3.3.8  Macro:  LTEXT(TIDM,text string,d1,count,d2)

             This macro  enables the  user to specify  text to  be sent  to the
        terminal at certain times.  The valid arguments for "xxxx" are:

               TIDM    TID message to be sent at connect  time.  Default
                       is  'please   type  your   terminal  identifier'.
                       Delays can  also be  inserted into  this message.
                       The duration of the first delays is set by D1 and
                       causes  a  delay  of D1  thirtieths  of  a second
                       between  sending   the  first  COUNT   number  of
                       characters.   The  remaining  characters  will be
                       sent with a delay of D2 thirtieths of a second.





                    3.3.9  Macro:  LTEXT(xxxx,text string)

        <ULMSG>###User login message to be sent after the terminal type is
        identified.  Default is no message.  This message is also called the
        1-down message, and can be downloaded to the CONSAT from the network.





                    3.3.10  Macro:  NOBUSY(port range 1,...port range n)

             This ranging macro specifies an Async port or range of ports which
        are NOT to be  considered for BUSY-OUT control (e.g.   non-VADIC modems
        -- note that this function is automatically performed for HD202 ports).

                    3.3.11  Macro:  NO.CP(port range 1,...port range n)

             This ranging macro specifies an Async port or range of ports which
        are NOT to  be considered for Answer/hang  based on CP  control signals
        (Note that this function is automatically performed for HD202 ports).





                    3.3.12  Macro:  TID120(port range 1,...port range n)

             This ranging macro  specifies an Async port  or range of  ports to
        send the TID message to the  port at 1200 baud.  The default  for other
        ports is at 300 baud.

             Note:    In  order   to  avoid   problems  with   noise  detection
        capabilities in  some modems,  the message is  output at  a rate  of 10
        characters per second, but at either 300 or 1200 baud.





                    3.3.13  Macro:  TID240(port range 1,...port range n)

             This macro  has the same  function as TID120  except that  the TID
        message is sent to the port at 2400 baud.





                    3.3.14  Macro:  TID480(port range 1,...port range n)

             This macro  has the same  function as TID120  except that  the TID
        message is sent to the port at 4800 baud.





                    3.3.15  Macro:  INITANSWER(port range 1,...port range n)

             The selected ports will be answerred at startup if carrier and DSR
        is presented to the Consat.

                    3.3.16  Macro:  TIDSPP(port range 1,...port range n)

             The macro TIDSPP  has been implemented  to allow the  selection by
        port  of  sending the  "please  type your  terminal  identifier" (TIDM)
        message using space (0) parity instead of the default even parity.  The
        parameter syntax is identical to the usage of the TID120 macro.

             Example:    TIDSPP(0-3,8,11-15)

             Ports 0,1,2,3,8,11,12,13,14 and  15 will receive the  TIDM message
        with forced space parity.





                    3.3.17  Macro:  BFRSIZE(size)

             The BFRSIZE macro defines the bufferlet pool size in  decimal.  If
        used, the macro overrides the Consat default of 4096 bytes per 16 async
        ports.  The legal range is 4096 to 65536.





                    3.3.18  Macro:  ISISRING(size)

             The  ISISRING macro  defines the  ISIS input/output  ring  size in
        decimal.   If used,  the  macro overrides  the Consat  default  of 1024
        bytes.  The size  specified will include 4  bytes for fill  pointer and
        empty pointer.





                    3.3.19  Macro:  ASYNCRING(size)

             The ASYNCRING  macro defines the  async input/output ring  size in
        decimal.  If used, the macro overrides the Consat default of  64 bytes.
        The size specified will include  6 bytes for counter, fill  pointer and
        empty pointer.  (Note:  Foreground  overload can cause the  async input
        rings to wrap; increasing  the async ring size provides  more buffering
        and more  tolerance for  transient foreground  overload caused  by peak
        traffic loads.)

                    3.3.20  Macro:  SIOBUF(count)

             The SIOBUF macro defines the  number of SIO input buffers  in hex.
        If  used,  the macro  overrides  the  Consat default  of  10  hex input
        buffers.  The macro is  rarely used since the default  supports traffic
        at speeds up to 9600 bps  without data loss.  A larger value  uses more
        memory but provides no advantage, while a lower value  conserves memory
        but allows data loss under peak traffic loads.





                    3.3.21  Macro:  SETFLAG(flagname, on/off or 0/1)

             This macro is used to set tymfile flags on or off.  Such flags are
        OMRON, YTID, KANA, CRTID  and SLODTR.  For example,  SETFLAG(YTID,0) or
        SETFLAG(YTID,OFF) is the same as YTID EQ 0.



        3.3.21.1  Flag SLODTR

             The SLODTR  flags changes  the Consat to  require four  seconds of
        carrier before answering the port instead of the current two seconds.



        3.3.21.2  Flag CRTID

             The  CRTID  flag  defines  carriage return  (CR)  as  a  valid TID
        character.  This  TID character is  valid only  when PADRELatedfunction
        macro is enabled.  Otherwise,  the Consat rejects the CR  character and
        resends the "please type your TID" message.



        3.3.21.3  Flag AEQCR

             The AEQCR flag redefines the A  TID to be identical to the  CR TID
        and is used for certain PAD configurations.



        3.3.21.4  Flag YTID

             The YTID flag changes the CCT of a point of sale (POS) transaction
        terminal with a tid of 'Y' to 01 from 25.

        3.3.21.5  Flag KANA

             The KANA flag  disables O as a  TID character and redefines  the I
        TID character as selecting space parity.



        3.3.21.6  Flag OMRON

             The OMRON  flag is  used for OMRON  terminals.  This  prevents the
        message  defined  by   LTEXT(ULMSG,text)  from  being  sent   to  OMRON
        terminals.



        3.3.21.7  Flag TRANHX

             The TRANHX  flag allows  extended DDT translation  of hex  data to
        ASCII.   If  set, it  overrides  the Consat  default  and  extended DDT
        presents hex  data and the  corresponding ASCII  character.  Otherwise,
        extended DDT presents only the hex data.






                         3.4  Specialized Terminals and Modems


             A number of specialized terminals, modems, and  terminal protocols
        are  supported  by  the  CONSAT.   The  invocation  of  the appropriate
        handlers  (which  are not  normally  present in  the  assembled CONSAT,
        unless invoked) is performed by the following macros:





                    3.4.1  Halfduplex 202 modem support

             Bell 202S half-duplex modems are supported.

                    3.4.2  Macro:  HD202(port range 1,...port range n)

             This  ranging macro  specifies  an Async  port or  range  of ports
        assigned  to  Bell  202S half-duplex  modems.   Automatically  sets the
        specified ports as per NOBUSY option.

             NOTE:  As of  version 4.00, this is  not a generic  HD202 support,
        but a specific protocol using line turn around characters.





                    3.4.3  BAUDOT terminals

             These terminals are  supported - both on  ASYNC and SIO  drivers -
        but are invoked using the PVC/AID mechanism.  Support is  available for
        both transparent usage, and translate-to-ASCII (default) mode:   in the
        latter mode,  the CCITT  standard is used,  with the  following special
        translations:

                BAUDOT  ASCII

                  WRU    ENQ
                 NO. 6    $
                 NO. 7    #
                 NO. 8    &

             See the PVC section for usage.

               NOTE:   PVC options,  PAR, HDX,  NOCRLF, NOLFCR,  are not
                       supported  by  BAUDOT terminal  handler.   Use of
                       these options will cause assembly errors.





                    3.4.4  Macro:  BAUDQS(port range 1,...port range n)

             This ranging macro specifies an  Async port or range of  ports for
        virtual  telex,  which supports  untranslateable  characters  (ASCII to
        BAUDOT) sent as a Baudot question mark (?)  instead of  discarding them
        and specific characters expanded to text strings (# to NBR, % to O/O, &
        to AND, $ to DLR).  NOTE:   This macro is used only for TID34  & TID35,
        and does not apply to SIO.

        are  invoked using  the  PVC/AID mechanism.   See the  PVC  section for
        usage.  Both transparent  and translate-to-ASCII are supported;  in the
        latter mode, the following special keys are mapped:

                           4.1  Functions Common To All PVC


             These functions are common to all PVC usage; functions specialized
        to specific devices are described in succeeding sections.





                    4.1.1  Macro:  PTEXT(message number,text string)

             If not specified, this defaults to the standard messages:

             msg no.    text
             ------     ----

                1       'circuit building in progress'
                2       'circuit lost - rebuilding'
                3       'ALO username configuration error'
                4       'ALO password configuration error'
                5       'ALO login string configuration error'
                6       'Circuit lost - will try later'

             This macro allows the  user to override the default  PVC messages,
        where message  number specifies  which of the  six default  messages is
        being replaced.  The text must adhere to the syntax described  for text
        arguments.

             Messages 3, 4, and  5, only apply to  ports that have ALO  set on.
        They indicate an  error in the configuration  of STEXT or UTEXT,  or in
        the validation of the generated username and password, and should never
        be encountered.

                    4.1.2  Macro:  UTEXT(login text string)

             This  macro allows  a user  to override  the ALO  generation  of a
        username and password  based on a node  and port number, and  defines a
        replacement login text string.   The replacement string may be  used by
        all ALO ports, or may,  by repetition of the statement,  specify unique
        login strings for selected ports.   If single ports or groups  of ports
        are  to have  different login  strings, each  UTEXT definition  must be
        followed immediately by a UTXRNG (or SUTXRG, for SIO)  statement, which
        specifies the ports using the corresponding login string.  The  text of
        the  login  string  must  adhere  to  the  syntax  described  for  text
        arguments.

             If the UTEXT option is  invoked, the rest of ports  not explicitly
        assigned by  the use of  the UTXRNG (or  SUTXRG) macro still  use login
        strings  (username  and  password) generated  based  on  node  and port
        numbers, and optional security characters.

               NOTE:   Multiple  UTEXT  entries  are  expensive  in core
                       requirements.





                    4.1.3  Macro:  PCOPAR(pco parameter,seconds)

             This macro is  used to set seconds  in decimal for  PCO parameters
        such   as    PCWAIT,   RETRYDELAY    and   TRYDELAY.     For   example,
        PCOPAR(PCWAIT,20) is the same as PCOWAT EQ 20.

        PCOPAR(PCWAIT,20)       : Same as PCOWAT  EQ  20 , default 0 seconds
        PCOPAR(TRYDEL,40)       : Same as PCOTRY  EQ  40 , default 90 seconds
        PCOPAR(RETRYD,30)       : Same as PCORTY  EQ  30 , default 90 seconds

                    4.1.4  Parameter:  PCOTRY/PCOWAT/PCORTY

             The configuration  equate parameters,  PCOWAT, PCOTRY  and PCORTY,
        control the time delays in the rebuilding of a PCO circuit.

             When a PCO port is initialized, it attempts to log in to  the host
        it is configured for.  One of three things may happen:

          1.  The circuit can be successfully built by the Supervisor and
              accepted by the host;

          2.  The circuit may not be built due to lack of Supervisor connec-
              tion or host unavailability, and therefore the port would
              remain in login mode; or

          3.  The circuit can be successfully built by the Supervisor, and
              then zapped or hung by the host.

             The definition of PCOWAT, PCOTRY and PCORTY as follows:

             PCOWAT, PCOTRY and PCORTY are only applied to the  above mentioned
        case  3.  That  is, if  a circuit  to the  host is  completed,  and the
        circuit is zapped (or hung if  'NOHNG' is set) by the host.   PCOWAT is
        defined for seconds to wait  before another login attempt will  be made
        and before the 'circuit lost  - rebuilding' message is sent out  to the
        users.  If, upon this second login attempt, the circuit to the  host is
        completed, and the circuit is zapped (or hung) by the host  again.  PCO
        control routine  to test  if the  previous circuit  has been  up PCOTRY
        seconds.  If yes, then wait PCOWAT seconds to rebuild a circuit; if no,
        then wait PCORTY seconds to rebuild a circuit.

             The explanation of three PCO paramters usage.

             Ninety seconds after a login  attempt is made, the code  checks to
        see if the port is still in login mode (i.e., the circuit has  not been
        built), and, if so, zaps the circuit and attempts to rebuild it.   If a
        circuit to  the host  is completed, and  the circuit  is zapped  by the
        host,(or hung if  'NOHNG' is set), another  login attempt will  be made
        immediately.  (NOTE!  A new parameter PCOWAT is implemented  in Version
        5.00)  PCOWAT  is defined  for  seconds to  wait  before  another login
        attempt will be made; if there is no PCOWAT be specified, another login
        attempt will be made immediately  as the default value is  zero second.
        Users will see message (  circuit lost - rebuilding) in  PCOWAT seconds
        after the  first circuit zapped  by the host,  otherwise users  see the
        message right after the first circuit zapped upon no  PCOWAT specified.
        If,  upon  this  second  login attempt,  the  circuit  to  the  host is
        completed and  then zapped (or  hung) by the  host, the  following will
        occur:

          1.  If more than PCOTRY seconds had elapsed since the login string
              was sent, another login will be attempted after PCOWAT seconds.

          2.  If fewer than PCOTRY seconds had elapsed, the following
              message is sent to the terminal (unless redefined by <PTEXT>):

                      circuit lost...will try later

              Another login attempt will be delayed until PCORTY seconds
              seconds have elapsed.  At that time, the message

                      circuit building in progress

              will be sent to the user (unless redefined by <PTEXT>).

             Any subsequent login attempts for PCO ports will be tempered  by a
        determination of whether or not  the previous circuit had been  up long
        enough to be  considered stable, i.e.,  up longer than  PCOTRY seconds.
        It should  be noted  that the  parameter PCOTRY  is the  same parameter
        which determined the delay for subsequent login attempts if the port is
        zapped  (or hung)  while in  login mode.   This includes  the situation
        where the  port is zapped  by the  node itself if  the port  remains in
        login mode for more than 90 seconds.

             The number of elapsed  seconds is specified in decimal.   For both
        of PCOTRY and PCORTY, the minimum  time interval that may be set  is 32
        seconds; the maximum, 7200  seconds.  Both parameters, if  not defined,
        default  to  90 seconds.   But  for PCOWAT  paramter,  if  not defined,
        default to  0 second and  the maximum  delay timer may  be set  to 7200
        seconds.  These parameters  only apply if ALO  has been set on  for the
        port.

               NOTE:   Those  macros  refer  ONLY  to  ASYNC   ports  --
                       additional macros are defined to provide the same
                       functionality for  SIO ports, to  avoid requiring
                       knowledge   of   the   internal   port-assignment
                       structure.

             The first  two macros  are required  only if  PVC ASYNC  ports are
        defined which are not declared using the PVCEX macro.





                    4.2.1  Macro:  PVCRNG(port range 1,...port range n)

             This ranging macro defines  the range of default PVC  ASYNC ports.
        All ports which require default PVC service must be included.

                    4.2.2  Macro:  PVCDF(option 1,...option n)

             Every ASYNC port specified by the PVCRNG macro which does not have
        an explicit  option assignment  using the PVCEX  macro will  default to
        those options specified by this macro.  If neither option of  an option
        pair is specified for a port  by PVCDF or PVCEX, the port  will default
        to the option indicated as a default in the following sections.

             This macro  defines the  default parameters  for ASYNC  PVC ports.
        Parameter values may be any valid combination of the  options described
        in the PVC  Parameters section of  this document.  Those  options which
        are mutually exclusive are indicated.

             The default options (those used if not specified) are:

                NOAID   NPI     NOALO   NOPCO   NOSLO
                NOPAR   NOHDX   CRLF    LFCR    NORBP
                NOTRS   HNG     TXT     NOMPC   NODSC
                WRU     NOSPAR  NOKAT   NOUPC   NORCV
                NOPRB





                    4.2.3  Macro:  PVCEX(port range,option1,...optionx)

             If  PVCEX  is  not  specified, all  ASYNC  ports  will  assume the
        defaults specified in PVCDF.

             This macro defines PVC  options for a (single) specified  range of
        port numbers.  The options are entered as in the PVCDF statement.  This
        statement  overrides  the  defaults set  by  PVCDF.   The  port numbers
        specified must have been declared by PVCRNG.





                    4.2.4  Macro:  STEXT(text string)

             Default -- no  security sequence will  be appended to  the default
        password unless this macro is invoked.

             This  macro allows  the  user to  define  up to  a  four character
        security sequence text string  which will be appended to  the generated
        password  for ALO  ports.   The characters  must be  valid  as password
        characters.

                    4.2.5  Macro:  UTXRNG(port range 1,...port range n)

             This ranging macro is only present if a UTEXT string  is declared.
        This statement specifies the ALO ports that will have the  login string
        specified by the UTEXT statement immediately preceding this statement.






                                     4.3  SIO PVC


             In  order to  avoid a  need to  explicitly bias  the  port numbers
        specified for SIO  PVC ports, different  macros are defined  to perform
        this port-relocation automatically.





                    4.3.1  Macro:  SPVRNG(port range 1,...port range n)

             This macro defines the range  of SIO PVC ports.  Port  numbers are
        specified in decimal.  This macro, like PVCRNG, may be repeated as many
        times as necessary to define all SIO PVC ports.





                    4.3.2  Macro:  SPVCEX(port range 1,...port range n)

             Like PVCEX, except that the port number range specified applies to
        SIO ports only, and must have been declared by SPVRNG.

               NOTE:   ALL SIO PVC ports must be specified using SPVCEX!





                    4.3.3  Macro:  SUTXRG(port range 1,...port range n)

             Like UTXRNG, except that the port number specified applies  to SIO
        ports only.

                                  4.4  PVC Parameters


             PVC parameter values (used for PVCDF and PVCEX macros) may  be any
        valid combination of the options described below.  Those  options which
        are  mutually exclusive  are  indicated.  Parameter  defaults  are also
        indicated.





                    4.4.1  NPI/NONPI

             NPI prints the node/port identifier for AID ports (default).

             NONPI disables printing of the node/port identifier.





                    4.4.2  TXT/NOTXT

             TXT permits text to be output to ports (default).

             NOTXT  disables  printing  of  text  (includes  NONPI,  i.  e.  no
        node/port  identifier will be output), but is limited to text generated
        by the node.





                    4.4.3  MPC/NOMPC

             MPC (Multiplexed PVC Candidate) specifies that this port is  to be
        considered  a  candidate  for  MPVC.  That  is,  the  username  will be
        examined  to determine  if this  port qualifies  for MPVC  service.  If
        username  does not  pass  exam, this  port  is not  qualified  for MPVC
        service  and  is treated  as  PVC candidate.   This  option  is ignored
        (without  comment)  if  MPVC  is not  enabled  in  a  particular CONSAT
        environment.

             NOMPC  specifies  that  this  port  is  not  automatically  a MPVC
        candidate.  That is, the username  will not be examined.  But  the port
        may become a  MPVC candidate dependent upon  TID usage, for  example, Y
        TID or TID14).  (default)

                    4.4.4  AID/NOAID

             The AID (Automatic  IDentification) option specifies that  as soon
        as a port becomes physically connected, the CONSAT handles the  port as
        if the TID prompt had been sent, and an appropriate character received.
        Once defined as an AID port,  the port is not available to  service any
        terminal types other than the one specified.

             AID sets automatic  terminal identification.  It must  be followed
        in the option list by a TID type:

        connected, and terminal identification is supplied (either by the user,
        or,  if enabled,  by  the AID  option), the  CONSAT  will automatically
        generate a username and password.  The user is not prompted  to 'please
        log in:', and does not have the option of specifying an  alternate host
        number initially.  Instead of the 'please log in:'  prompt,  the CONSAT
        sends the message 'circuit building in progress'.  Nothing else will be
        sent to the terminal until the host sends its greeting message.  If the
        log  in  is  not  successful  ,  a  message  such  as  'circuit  lost -
        rebuilding' , or 'circuit lost - will try again later' will be  sent to
        the terminal.  See Appendice I for a description of the format  used to
        generate an automatic login string.

             If ALO is specified, either PCO or SLO must also be specified.

             NOALO specifies that no  automatic login string will  be generated
        (default).





                    4.4.6  PCO/NOPCO

             PCO  (Permanent Circuit  Option)  specifies that  the  CONSAT will
        attempt to rebuild a  circuit to the home  host if the circuit  is lost
        and  the  port  remains   connected.   The  message  'circuit   lost  -
        rebuilding' is sent to the terminal, and the generated login  string is
        sent to the network as was done when the port was initially connected.

             If the login attempt fails (for example, if the host system or the
        TYMCOM is down), a new  login string will be sent automatically  to the
        network at  intervals specified by  PCOTRY/PCORTY until the  circuit is
        re-established, as long as the port remains connected.

             The PCO user should be aware that forgetting to turn  the terminal
        off,  thereby  leaving  the port  connected,  will  cause  connect time
        charges  to  accrue,  since  the CONSAT  will  continue  trying  to re-
        establish a circuit for a connected port that has PCO set on.

             NOPCO specifies no permanent circuit (default).

             The options PCO and SLO are mutually exclusive, but one of the two
        must be specified if the ALO option has been set.

                    4.4.7  SLO/NOSLO

             SLO (Subsequent Login Option) specifies that a user has the choice
        of logging onto  the home host or  an alternate host when  his original
        circuit is lost.  When the CONSAT detects that a PVC port  circuit with
        SLO set on has been lost, it sends the 'please log in:'  prompt  to the
        terminal.  The user may choose any of the three following responses:

               1.  --  Disconnect the terminal.  If AID is specified for
                       this  port,  the  user  need  only  reconnect the
                       terminal, and a new circuit will be built  to the
                       home host.

               2.  --  Log in to  an alternate host, using  the standard
                       network format.

               3.  --  Specify  a new  circuit  (to the  home  host), by
                       entering:

                                  :L(carriage return)
                                       -- or --
                                :L:HH(carriage return)

               NOTE -  The colon puts the user in control mode,  and the
                       L(carriage return) directs the CONSAT  to rebuild
                       the circuit to the home host.

               NOTE -  Using  the  second  form,  the  user  is  able to
                       specify  explicitly  an  alternate   host  number
                       ('HH', in decimal) to which the circuit is  to be
                       directed.   This  mode  applies  ONLY  to default
                       username/password usage  -- for ports  which have
                       specified  an  alternate  login  string  (via the
                       UTEXT  Macro),  ':L'  (with   no  carriage-return
                       needed) is the only available option.

             NOSLO specifies no subsequent  login to an alternate host  will be
        allowed (default).

             The options SLO and PCO are mutually exclusive.





                    4.4.8  PAR/NOPAR

             PAR sets even parity.

             NOPAR sets no parity, 8-bit data (default).

                       interface   is  ambiguous   during   login.   The
                       terminal  identifier  message (TIDM)  is  sent in
                       even parity, and any network  originated messages
                       will  have mark  parity.  If  NOPAR is  set, they
                       will be passed to the terminal this way.





                    4.4.9  HNG/NOHNG

             HNG specifies the CONSAT will  hang up (disconnect) a port  if the
        TID is not entered within  16 to 32 seconds following the  'please type
        your  terminal identifier'  prompt, or  when the  network sends  a hang
        signal  following   the  'Please   see  your   representative'  message
        (default).

             NOHNG allows an  infinite TID timer  and prevents the  CONSAT from
        hanging a port when a  hang character pair is transmitted.   NOHNG also
        converts a hang signal to a zap signal.





                    4.4.10  DSC/NODSC

             DSC specifies the CONSAT will hang up on a port if the  circuit is
        Zapped.  This parameter overrides NOHNG, PCO, and SLO.

             NODSC prevents the CONSAT from hanging a port when the  circuit is
        zapped (default).





                    4.4.11  HDX/NOHDX

             HDX  simulates half  duplex handling  (e.g., no  character echoing
        except for CR/LF pairs).

             NOHDX specifies no half duplex handling (default).

               NOTE:   This  is a  simulation of  half  duplex involving
                       echo handling, and  does not support  actual half
                       duplex devices.

                    4.4.12  CRLF/NOCRLF

             CRLF specifies a carriage return will be echoed with  the linefeed
        when a linefeed is entered at the terminal (default).

             NOCRLF specifies  a carriage  return will not  be echoed  with the
        linefeed.





                    4.4.13  LFCR/NOLFCR

             LFCR specifies a linefeed will be echoed with the  carriage return
        when a carriage return is entered at the terminal (default).

             NOLFCR specifies a linefeed  will not be echoed with  the carriage
        return.





                    4.4.14  RBP/NORBP

             RBP  specifies  reverse  backpressure  capability  (e.g., terminal
        control of character flow as  would occur if a Control-R  were imbedded
        in the login string).

             NORBP specifies no reverse backpressure capability (default).





                    4.4.15  WRU/NOWRU

              These two  options specifically for  TID34 and TID35  type ports.
        WRU  option controls  the  exchange between  the TELEX  device  and the
        CONSAT  prior to  a successful  login.  If  WRU is  defined in  the PVC
        exception,  the  ABACK (answerback)  macro  is used  to  define  a text
        answerback to  be sent in  response to WRU  characters received  from a
        TELEX device  connected to  TID34 or TID35  type ports  (default).  WRU
        defined in the PVC exception, but no answerback macro defined causes no
        text to be sent, but users can still login.

             NOWRU specifies no WRU characters received from a TELEX device.

                    4.4.16  SPAR/NOSPAR

             The option SPAR specifies all data to the terminal to be forced to
        space (0) parity.

             NOSPAR  specifies  all data  to  the  terminal to  be  8  bit data
        (default).





                    4.4.17  KAT/NOKAT

             The option KAT specifies that the CONSAT will support  Katakana on
        PVC circuit.  Enter control K  in login mode ("please log  in:"  banner
        sent to terminals) will also support Katakana on non-PVC ports.

             NOKAT specifies  that the  CONSAT port  will not  support Katakana
        (default).





                    4.4.18  UPC/NOUPC

             The  option  UPC  specifies  all data  sent  to  terminals  are in
        uppercase.  Entering control U in login mode for regular ports does the
        same function as UPC specified in PVCEX or PVCDF.

             NOUPC  specifies all  data sent  to terminals  are not  limited in
        uppercase only (default).





                    4.4.19  RCV/NORCV

             The option RCV limit  addressable ports to "receive  only" status.
        For these ports, only circuits originated from the network are allowed;
        the device connected to these ports can not initiate a login.

             NORCV does  not limit addressable  ports to "receive  only" status
        (default).

                                 5 -  Multiplexed PVC


             The following statement is to be included in the .TYM file:

                DECLARE(MPVC,NUMBER)

             This  specifies  the  NUMBER of  Multiplexed  PVC  Pseudo-ports to
        assign;  the default is 0.  If zero or not defined, MPVC  capability is
        NOT included in the configuration.  The actual number of ports assigned
        to the configuration (normally  equal to the number of  physical ports)
        is increased by this amount, and it is these ports which will originate
        the actual PVC's which are used to multiplex the other ports.   If this
        causes the total number of  ports to exceed constraints imposed  by the
        code, an assembly diagnostic will be issued.

             The additional ports are defined, and the macro PVCRNG  is invoked
        to  automatically  declare them  all  PVC ports.   The  appropriate PVC
        exception conditions are also declared.






                  5.1  Macro:  MUTXRG(port range 1,...,port range n)


             Like UTXRNG,   except that  the port  number specified  applies to
        MPVC pseudo-ports only.






                        5.2  Macro:  MPVCUS(port range,USERID)


             This macro is used to define one of a set of USERID criteria for a
        port.   "Port range"  specifies the  range of  pseudo-port  numbers, as
        above.

               NOTE:   Currently, only  the first  port of  "port range"
                       will have  ports assigned --  the option  is open
                       for  future  expansion  in  the  areas  of  load-
                       leveling and improving response.

             USERID is a text string, used to distinguish various MPVC ports by
        matching with the first characters of the username.

             The USERID text string should be specified in upper-case.  Failure
        to do so will prevent successful matches.

             The text may contain special "wild-card" characters:


               "|" ("7C)  Match ANY valid user-name character.  Will NOT
                       match user-name terminator characters  (":", ";",
                       or <CR>).

               "}" ("7D)  End_of_match!   Encountering   this  character
                       during the matching process  signals (successful)
                       matching of username, even if entire username has
                       not  yet been  scanned (also  "matches" user-name
                       terminator characters).

             The following examples should help clarify this:

           USERID username   Remarks
             US     USE    Fails...names different length
             US|    USE    Succeeds...wild char
             US}    USE    Succeeds...end_of_match

            U|E}   USART   Fails...wild char OK, "A" doesn't match "E"

               NOTE:   Successive MPVC USERID declarations  are examined
                       for  a  match  USERID in  DEFINITION  order  -- a
                       USERID  which  is a  substring  of  another (e.g.
                       "US}"  <<  "USA}") should  be  defined  later for
                       reliable action.  Note also that the  username is
                       converted  to UPPER  case ASCII  before  they are
                       compared -- thus "user" will match "US}".






                         5.3  Macro:  LTEXT(MPVCx,text string)


             This macro defines a text string to be output for MPVC.  The first
        argument MUST be  the string "MPVCx", where  "x" may be  any alphabetic
        (A-Z) or numeric (0-9) character.

             These  strings are  used for  the SUCCID  and FAILID  arguments of
        MPVCFO, and must be defined  BEFORE the invocation of the  MPVCFO macro
        which references them.

               than one invocations of MPVCFO.






                         5.4  Macro:  MPVCFO(port number,...)


             This macro  has a  number of different  fields, each  specifying a
        particular option.  These  options specify format conventions  for each
        MPVC -- ALL are required:

             Field 2 -- BLOKID

             This is the representation  of a single-character, either  in HEX,
        or  defined  with  radix  ($n  V).  It  is  used  to  define  a special
        multiplexed control code to identify that the following byte of data is
        a  sub-channel   identifier.   The   character  chosen   should  appear
        infrequently in the data stream and must be same characters as  used by
        host application.

             Field 3 -- SIGNID

             This is the representation  of a single-character, as in  Field 2.
        It is used to define a special multiplexed control code  to distinguish
        that the following byte (or  two bytes - for two-byte signals)  of data
        is  a  circuit-control  signal.   The  character  chosen  should appear
        infrequently in the data stream  and must be same character as  used by
        host application.

             Field 4 -- ESCID

             This is the representation  of a single-character, as in  Field 2.
        It is  used to  define a special  escape character  code to  permit the
        distinction of other codes from data.  It designates that the following
        byte  of  data is  (unconditionally)  data,  even if  it  has  the same
        representation as one of  the MPVC control characters  (BLOKID, SIGNID,
        or ESCID).  The character chosen must be same character as used by host
        application.

                            6 -  CONSAT Video Display Unit


             The design of the CONSAT Video Display Unit interface is primarily
        directed toward the function of "Port Addressing".

             There  are  two  aspects  of  Port  Addressing  which  are visible
        external to the CONSAT.  These are:

            o       Configuration of ports susceptible to addressing;

            o       Differences  in usage  (as seen  by  the terminal
                    user) for such ports.

             This section will address these issues.






                            6.1  Implementation Constraints


             The implementation has certain constraints associated with it:

             Specifically,  operation  is  not  supportable  for  the  case  of
        terminals which operate in a half duplex line (as opposed  to terminal)
        protocol.   The obvious  candidates for  affliction are  2741  and 3767
        terminals, which  are half-duplex  by source-line  (the printer  is not
        available while the  keyboard is unlocked  -- seizing these  ports does
        not provide the  ability to inform the  terminal of seizure,  let alone
        the ability of communication); and certain types of half-duplex modems,
        notably the Bell 202S (wherein the communications-link must be "turned-
        around").   These cases  all use  the "TYMNET  Green-ball"  to activate
        these  "turn-arounds", and  this particular  signal is  not  suited for
        terminal-terminal communications, as its intended purpose  is terminal-
        host  usage,  and  there  is  an  incapability  of   distinguishing  an
        origination request from a response in this environment.

                        6.2  Configuration for Port Addressing


             In order to provide  externally accessible port addressing,  it is
        first  necessary to  configure the  CONSAT to  support  the capability.
        This capability will not be inherent in the CONSAT; it will  be present
        only if invoked.

             The parameters which  need to be  associated with one  another for
        this service are:

           o   Logical port number (or range of ports);
           o   Target Host number;
           o   Target Host attribute;
           o   Corresponding address (or range of addresses).

             The mechanism chosen  to perform these functions  is the use  of a
        family of macros:

            ADRPRT(Port range,host,Address range,Attributes)
               used for ASYNC ports.

            SADPRT(Port range,host,Address range,Attributes)
               used for SIO ports.

             In all cases arguments are decimal;  these are:

            PORT RANGE:  this is a port number (or range of ports, specified as
                "Low-High"), to which this declaration will apply.

            HOST:  The host  number which will be  used to target  these ports.
                (NOTE:  This  also becomes the  accounting or  origination host
                for circuits originating on this port, overriding  all previous
                declarations without warning.)

            ADDRESS RANGE:  The address (or range of addresses) assigned to the
                port (or range of  ports); in this case, successive  ports will
                be  assigned  successive  numeric  addresses  of Address_Range,
                until these are exhausted -- subsequent ports are  assigned the
                last Address.   The first  port of Port_Range  will be  used if
                this field is left blank.

            ATTRIBUTE:  The  attribute to  apply to  the specified  host; (this
                attribute refers  to the  condition where  the host  address is
                accessed without  use of an  associated sub-host  address [sub-
                host  address is  null]; a  declaration overrides  all previous
                declarations).   Values  are symbolic,  and  selected  from the
                list:
            NULL:   Null address is disallowed;
            ZERO:   Null address maps to address 0;
            ANY:    Null address maps to ANY address.
            ("NULL" is the default attribute if the field is left blank.)

             A macro can be invoked repeatedly for the same host to provide the
        capability for several sets of ports.  It also invokes the functions of
        the existing ACHOST, AHRNG, and SHRNG macros.

            NOTE:  previous  ACHOST declarations  will be lost,  and --  if not
                   overridden later -- the last such definition will become the
                   default origination host.   Thus all PA  declarations should
                   occur   before   other   ACHOST   declarations,   and   such
                   declarations  should  take  care  not  to  override  the  PA
                   declarations.

             Each port specified by RANGE  will be selected as a  PA candidate.
        Ports may be selected more than  once, to permit a physical port  to be
        accessible via more than one  host access (this will provide  levels of
        access  control to  specific  ports; one  user may  reference  a single
        host/sub-host, while a  second may have access  to a second  host which
        includes the first as one of the available sub-hosts).

             As a cross-check, PVC ports  will be checked to ensure  that there
        is no conflict between PVC usage and PA usage (such as PCO option).

             As a point of interest, the declaration will declare the host, and
        create a unique host:port:address assignment; this is later formed into
        a set of lists (one for each host) relating address to port.  A circuit
        arriving for a particular host will cause the corresponding list  to be
        searched, and  for each occurrence  of that address,  the corresponding
        port will be examined for activity.  If no address-match is  found, the
        circuit will be terminated  (with an appropriate message);  likewise if
        no  port is  available.   The circuit  will  be assigned  to  the first
        available port with that address.

             The  ability  to  specify multiple  ports  with  the  same address
        provides  the  capability  to  create  "rotors"  or   "hunt-groups"  (a
        collection of ports, any of which will accept a message).






                                  6.3  Terminal Usage


             The terminal  user will  see no change  in the  initial part  of a
        connection.

             Depending upon the PVC options (if any), he may get a "please type
        your terminal identifier",  "node:port identifier", and/or  "please log
        in".

             If  optioned  for ALO,  this  takes precedence  over  PA;  the ALO
        circuit is constructed, and the port is declared busy.

        CONSAT Video Display Unit                               August 19, 1987


             At the end of the ALO  session -- or initially if there is  no ALO
        -- the user is presented with a "please log in" and the port  is placed
        in "limbo mode" state.  It remains in this state until:

            1.  The terminal is powered off (no longer answered);

            2.  The  port   is assigned  to   (commandeered  by)  PA usage;
                or

            3.  The user enters  the first character  of a new  logon (thus
                declaring   the  port   busy).    (NOTE...terminal  control
                characters,  such  as control-H  for  half-duplex,  are not
                considered  part  of  a  new  logon  for  this  usage.  The
                terminal  user  may  enter  such  control  characters while
                remaining  in limbo;  the entering  of the  first printable
                character of  the username causes  the port to  be declared
                busy.)

             Each session-end (denoted by  the arrival of a zapper)  will cause
        the port  to re-enter "limbo  mode", wherein it  is a candidate  for PA
        service, and  is not  attempting to build  a circuit.   As soon  as the
        first new logon character is entered, limbo gives way to logon.

             Note that there is a small but finite time-window during  which an
        active session could be zapped and PA service initiated before the user
        could  respond  with another  attempt  to build  a  circuit.   There is
        another, even  smaller window,  wherein the user  could type  the first
        character  of a  new logon,  and PA  could take  control away  from him
        before the CONSAT  saw the typed character.   Since the user  could not
        distinguish the actual sequence which occurred, he would have to assume
        that the character he had just typed was now directed back along the PA
        circuit.

             When a port is commandeered by a circuit, a message is output:

            "Port seized at [date] (GMT), by [origination I.D.]"

             Where:  [date] is the current time and date (GMT);  and

                     [origination I.D.] is the username, circuit
                       origination,  or other identification appropriate
                       to that circuit.

            NOTE:  There is at present an unresolved problem which needs to
                   be  addressed:   While  in  limbo,  the   user  terminal
                   displays "please log in".  When the port is  seized, the
                   "Port seized..."  message is output as a warning.  It is
                   possible,  particularly   with  CRT  terminals,   for  a
                   malicious user to seize a port, erase that  message, and
                   lie  in wait  for him  to attempt  a new  logon, thereby
                   capturing  his username  and password.   To  avoid this,
                   users must be cautioned to disconnect and  reconnect the

                   terminal before use  as a circuit origination,  after an
                   unattended period of "limbo" usage.





                    6.3.1  Usage while "Seized"

             A port in limbo may be seized by an incoming call.   While seized,
        there will be no  echoing in response to  input from either end  of the
        circuit (i.e.  both ends of the circuit are in "echo-off"  state).  Any
        echoing  is  thus  the  responsibility  of  (and  agreed  upon  by) the
        terminals at either end of the circuit.  This includes the insertion of
        LF after CR, CR after LF,  and all other special options.  If  the port
        is seized  by a  host, that host  may emit  an "echo-on"  signal, after
        which the  CONSAT port will  operate in the  normal fashion.   This is,
        however, not possible if the call originates at a CONSAT or TYMSAT.

             The circuit  is broken  (at the  seized port)  if either  a zapper
        arrives, or if the terminal is disconnected (powered off).  The arrival
        of a zapper will cycle the port back to the limbo state.






                                 6.4  External Access


             The Port-Addressing METHOD has two aspects:





                    6.4.1  Addressing by the user

             The user specifies  port-addressing by entering a  login-string of
        the form:
             USER:[HOSTNO][.ADDR];

            where:

             HOSTNO  The  [optional]  destination  host.    If  "home-
                     targeting" is used, this field may be omitted.

            .ADDR   The  [optional]  host  sub-address.   This  is  a
                    string  of  decimal  digits,  delimited   by  the
                    (required) "." prefix.  The absence of this field
                    is a "NULL  Sub-Address";  it causes  normal host
                    addressing.

        CONSAT Video Display Unit                               August 19, 1987


                    6.4.2  Addressing at the Host

             The  "called" host  will  normally receive  as part  of  the login
        needle a username field of the form:

            USER[:[HOSTNO][.ADDR]]

             where HOSTNO and ADDR are described above.  "[...]" are optional.

             In the normal case, the string consists of "USER".

             In the case of transparent logins, the string  contains ":HOSTNO",
        and may also contain the ".ADDR" field, requesting sub-addressing.

             In  the  non-transparent  login  case,  the  string   consists  of
        "USER:.ADDR";

             In  all cases,  the called  host may  retrieve the  ADDR  field by
        scanning  the string  for ":"   (since USER  may contain  the character
        "."), and then  scanning past the subsequent  "."  and then  picking up
        the  ADDR  field.   If the  ADDR  field  is NULL,  then  the  scan will
        encounter the login string terminator (";" or <CR>) before  finding the
        ":"  -- "." sequence.

             TELEX "Extension  Cord" service provides  the ability to  make and
        receive TELEX calls through  the network using a teletype  terminal.  A
        TELEX terminal will be connected to a CONSAT PVC port which  provides a
        circuit  to  the  TELEX  Gateway, thus  providing  a  virtual  two wire
        connection through the network.  An IIX protocol passes  the signalling
        necessary  to  place  or  receive  TELEX  calls.   In  order  for TELEX
        "Extension Cord" services, the TELEX Gateway has to be kept informed of
        the current terminal signalling state, and must be able to control it.






                                7.1  Terminal Interface


             All signalling and character transmission takes place  through the
        transmit and receive wires.   Call signalling and states  are signalled
        by providing either  steady space or marking  on these wires.   The pin
        assignments on the RS232 connector are:

              Pin no. 2    Transmit
              Pin no. 3    Receive
              Pin no. 7    Signal Ground.

             Signalling  is space  (positive 12  volts) and  mark  (negative 12
        volts).  A change in signal (i.e.  space to mark) must be of a duration
        greater than 150 milliseconds to be recognized.  The default signalling
        from the CONSAT to the terminal will be spacing.

             In order to clarify further discussion, the transmit path from the
        TELEX terminal through the network to the TELEX network will  be called
        the forward path; the path from TELEX to terminal, backward path.

                              7.3  Circuit Establishment


             The TELEX Gateway is IIX capable, and has its own  sub-dialect for
        passing  the signalling  states.  After  a circuit  is  established the
        Gateway sends the IIX Select  Dialect with only the TELEX dialect  as a
        choice.  (Although it is a Gateway, it does not speak  "Gateway".)  The
        CONSAT must return an acceptance  of this dialect, or the  Gateway will
        zap the circuit.  The CONSAT sends spacing on the backward path (to the
        terminal)  and does  not respond  to any  signalling from  the terminal
        unless a network circuit is established.






                                7.4  TELEX IIX Dialect


             Because TELEX uses an IIX smart circuit, it is necessary to handle
        all of the Global IIX messages  as well as those of the  TELEX dialect.
        (See  attached  IIX messages  chart.)   The TELEX  dialect  type  is 11
        (8091),  the gateway  product ID  is 5E,  and uses  only  TELEX dialect
        message types 0-4 (C080-C083).  The rightmost bit represents the signal
        on the backward path; the next bit, the forward path.  The  CONSAT will
        only send  these messages if  it detects a  change in the  forward path
        signalling, or in response to  one of these messages from  the Gateway.
        Upon receipt of  a 0 type message,  the CONSAT will force  the backward
        path  to space  and return  the current  states to  the  Gateway.  Upon
        receipt of a 1,2, or 3 type message, the CONSAT will compare  the state
        of the  forward path with  the message state,  and if they  match, will
        force the backward path to the message state (1,3 = mark; 2 = space).

             Version 3.05 (and later)  of the ISIS CONSAT provides  support for
        logging devices with TELEX  signalling to log into the  TYMNET network.
        This  means that  either a  TELEX terminal,  or a  switch  using single
        subscriber signalling, can be connected to a port on the CONSAT.






                                 8.1  TELEX Signalling


             TELEX  RS-232  Signalling  uses  only  three  lines  (pins):   the
        transmit and receive  data lines, and signal  ground (pins 2,3  and 7).
        The state  of the  terminal is  indicated using  only the  transmit and
        receive data lines.  DSR/DTR signals are not used, and will  be ignored
        by the CONSAT.

             The  transmit  and  receive  data  lines  have  two  states, SPACE
        (positive  12  volts)  and  MARK  (negative  12  volts).    When  being
        interpreted as data, SPACE is 0, MARK is 1.

             When  the terminal  or  device is  not  being used,  the  send and
        receive data lines maintain a spacing (continuous break)  signal.  When
        the device wishes to initiate a Telex call, the signal from  the device
        is changed to marking (all 1's).  In TELEX terminology, this is  a CALL
        REQUEST.   The  receiving device  will  then respond  by  changing it's
        signal to  marking (CALL CONFIRM).   Data can now  be passed  in either
        direction.

                                 8.2  Data Translation


             TELEX traffic is in ITA No.  2 (International Telegraph Alphabet),
        a  five  bit  data  code  sometimes  called  BAUDOT.   The  CONSAT will
        translate this code  to ASCII for  communicating with the  network, and
        all data received from the  network will be translated to  BAUDOT.  See
        the appendix for actual data code translation tables.






                               8.3  Connection To CONSAT


             For connection  to the CONSAT,  the CONSAT will  supply continuous
        spacing.  Only if the signalling  state from the terminal goes  to mark
        from space (CALL  REQUEST), will the  CONSAT respond.  The  CONSAT will
        respond with a mark (CALL CONNECT) and attempt to log in the device.

             For terminals, the option  NOWRU is declared, and the  CONSAT will
        immediately send the greeting message and "please log in:" message.  On
        many terminals, the CALL REQUEST is  sent by using the CALL CLR  key on
        the terminal.

             For  connection directly  to  a TELEX  switch, the  WRU  option is
        declared.   After the  CALL REQUEST/CONFIRM  exchange, the  CONSAT will
        wait 16 seconds  for an ITA  No.  2 WRU  character (Figures Shift  - D)
        from the  TELEX switch.   When this  WRU is  received, the  CONSAT will
        respond with an assembled answerback string, and then send the greeting
        and "please log in:"  messages.

             NOTE:   This  connection  currently  has  only  been  tested  on a
        SIEMAN's  EDX switch  at FTCC.   Other equipment  may, or  may  not, be
        compatible with this function.

             The connection to  the network is terminated  by the receipt  of a
        TELEX DISCONNECT (line state switches to spacing) from the device.  The
        CONSAT will zap  the network circuit and  respond by returning  a TELEX
        DISCONNECT to the DEVICE.

             If a  network zapper is  received by the  CONSAT, the  CONSAT will
        initiate the exchange of disconnects.

             New  terminal  identifiers  were  added,  TID34  and   TID35.   It
        indicates to the CONSAT that CONSAT  a port is a connection to  a TELEX
        device.   The port  must also  be defined  as AID;  Two kinds  of speed
        supported are 50 and 75 baud async BAUDOT (not SIO).

             There are two  new options specifically  for TID34 and  TID35 type
        ports:  WRU and  NOWRU.  The default is  WRU.  The option  controls the
        exchange between the TELEX device and the CONSAT prior to  a successful
        login (see B1 above).  If WRU, an answerback must be defined  using the
        ABACK macro.

             The ABACK macro is used to define a text answerback to be  sent in
        response to WRU characters received from a TELEX device connected  to a
        TID34 and TID35 type port.

             The term Speedlink refers to customer's private  telegraph network
        used  for exchanging  messages  between customer's  offices  around the
        world.  Speedlink telex uses  polarity key signalling to  indicate line
        state.  There are four types of connections to support:


        1.[50 baud Polar Key]  [Originating]  [Terminating]  [ SPEEDLINK  ]
          [  TELEX device   ]==[  CONSAT   ]::[  CONSAT   ]==[TELEX switch]

          [   ASCII switch  ]==[  CONSAT   ]::[  CONSAT   ]==[ASCII switch ]



             Three new TID  entries, TID36, TID37,  and TID38, support  type 1,
        type 2, and type 3 telex connections respectively.  Old  TID10 supports
        the type 4 connection.






                             9.1  Polarity Key Signalling


             Polarity  Key  Signalling  is different  from  the  standard Telex
        signalling:  It provides a continuous terminal connection; there are no
        line state changes after connection; no WRU (Who aRe YoU) or answerback
        characters  are exchanged.   A connected  device supplies  a continuous
        'MARK' (referred to many names:  Z polarity, stop polarity, binary "1",
        or on-condition)  on the  device TD line.   If the  device fails  or is
        turned  off, a  'SPACE'  (referred to  many names:   A  polarity, start
        polarity, binary "0", or off-condition) signal is generated.

             The  standard  asynchronous  ports  on  the  engine  use  a 25-pin
        connector.  For polarity signalling, the only pins used are pin 2 (TD--

        Transmitted Data),  pin 3  (RD--Received Data),  and pin  7 (SG--Signal
        Ground).

             Connection type 1 to type  3 use the Polar Key signalling  for the
        line control.  The terminal and the other end of switch tell each other
        they are ready to receive messages by transmitting continuous 'MARK'.

             Connection type 4  uses Processor To Processor  (PTP) Interconnect
        Control.  PTP is a customer's protocol for the two  switches constantly
        to exchange control messages to  ensure the circuit is up  between them
        in both directions.   CONSAT can support  PTP protocol by  treating two
        switches as standard ASCII asynchronous start/stop devices.






                    9.2  Connection to CONSAT and Data Transmission


             All connections to the CONSAT use the standard  asynchronous ports
        on the TYMNET Engine.  Use of these features on Serial I/O  (SIO) ports
        is not supported.

             The network  connection between CONSATs  uses a  permanent virtual
        circuit  (PVC) and  the port  addressing capability.   The  Consat port
        initiating a circuit is referred to as the 'originating' port,  and the
        Consat port receiving the  circuit is referred to as  the 'terminating'
        port.

             Both  CONSATs  (Originating  &  Terminating)  initially  output  a
        continuous  SPACE  to  their  connected  devices.   The  CONSAT  at the
        originating end attempts to build a circuit if a continuous  MARK state
        is being received from the device at the originating end.  This circuit
        is accomplished  by using PVC  options of AID,  ALO, PCO.   The circuit
        terminates at another  CONSAT and is connected  to a port by  using the
        Port  Addressing mechanism.   The terminating  CONSAT only  accepts the
        circuit if the device at the terminating end is outputting a MARK.

             If either device toggles the  line state from MARK to  SPACE, both
        CONSATs will emit a continuous SPACE and zap the network  circuit until
        a network circuit is completed.   Both CONSATs will send a MARK  to the
        devices only if  a network circuit  exists.  If the  originating CONSAT
        fails on attempting to build a circuit, a new PCO retry timer parameter
        PCOWAT  will  delay  a  period of  PCOWAT  time  before  rebuilding the
        circuit.

             Once a circuit is built,  it provides a transparent path  for data
        exchange between two end devices.  There is no data translation (Baudot
        to ASCII or ASCII to Baudot) involved for type 1 & 2.

                           10 -  Microdata S-mode Connection







                                10.1  Purpose of S-mode


             The  purpose  of S-mode  project  is to  develop  support  for the
        interconnection  of  Microdata  terminals and  hosts  using  the TYMENT
        technology network and S-mode (Sovereign) connection.






                                10.2  S-mode Connection


             To be able to connect Microdata terminals in S-mode, the terminals
        to  be  supported  are  as  for  R-mode  (Reality)  connection.  S-mode
        connection also  requires Sovereign (M8000)  host computers.  CONSAT S-
        mode  supports the  interface between  Microdata terminals  and TYMNET;
        TYMCOM S-mode supports  the interface between Sovereign  host computers
        and TYMNET.  The terminals are supports for S-mode connection are:
         
         1) PRISM-4
         2) PRISM-5
         3) M100 - PRISM 4/5 emulator
         4) PRISM-14






                    10.3  The Difference Between R-mode and S-mode


             The  differences  between  S-mode and  R-mode  on  Microdata Prism
        terminals  are:  1)  In  R-mode,  each  key  depression  generates  one
        character;  In S-mode,  each key  depression generates  two characters.
        These character pairs are one character of information (>= E0  hex) and
        one  character  data  (20 to  DF  hex).   Additionally,  all characters


        55                      Preliminary CONSAT ERS               ISCS06.ERS
        Microdata S-mode Connection                             August 19, 1987


        generated in S-mode are 8-bit data offset from 20(hex) i.e.  no control
        characters can be generated.  NOTE: there is an exception to  this, the
        firmware can issue XON and  XOFF (hex 11 and 13), if  this backpressure
        mechanism is used.  2) In R-mode connection, the terminal will  stay in
        R-mode. In  S-mode connection,  the terminals power  up in  R-mode, and
        then they are  switched to S-mode  on receiving "enter  S-mode" control
        code (E1 hex). Finally they are switched back to R-mode by the  host or
        by the CONSAT when the circuit is disconnected.






                                10.4  Call Description


             The steps  involved in the  establishment of an  S-mode connection
        are as follows:

             (1) The user turns on terminal in R-mode.

             (2) The CONSAT detects the change in signalling, and either,
        if the port is not AID, forces space parity (TIDSPP) and sends the
        "please type your terminal identifier" message, or, if AID, passes
        on to (4).

             (3) User enters TID of "O".

             (4) CONSAT sets up port, with no transparency and space parity,
        masking all data output to 7-bit with space parity.

             (5) CONSAT sends to terminals the Node/Port number, any 1-down
        message, and "please log in:" prompt.

             (6) User logs in as usual.

             (7) TYMCOM receives needle from network Supervisor, recognizing
        the  IIX  capability, it sends back  "Select Dialect"  command to
        the CONSAT.  CONSAT then goes through the dialect negotiation process
        for the S-Mode
        connection.

             (8) After connected to the host, TYMCOM sends enter-transparency
        (ETM) signal. Now, data in 8-bit set are passed through network.

             (9) Using IIX sub-dialect message, the TYMCOM loads the "return to
        ASCII" with the terminal control code (EB hex) used to enter R-mode.

             (10) CONSAT gets sub-dialect messages from TYMCOM and saves those
        messages in the buffer for use at the end of the session.

             (11) TYMCOM sends the terminal control code (E1 hex) to switch the

        terminal in R-mode to in S-mode.

             (12) CONSAT passes the control code (E1 hex) to terminals to 
        force them in S-mode.

             (13) TYMCOM sends <break> OFF <CR> to host.

             (14) User to host session in S-mode is established.

             (15) Each key depression generates two characters. CONSAT passes
        pair characters to the network, and the host interprets this pair and
        echoes the corresponding characters (but may choose to echo something
        entirely different, e.g. $ or pound-sterling sign depending on the
        shift key used).

             (16) If network circuit is lost, TYMCOM sends host <break>
        OFF <CR> and zaps circuit.

             (17) If host is not available or disconnected, TYMCOM sends
        IIX clear message(C080), and CONSAT will clear message in IIX buffer.
        NOTE: TYMCOM may clear the stored message at any time.

             (18) Loss of network circuit causes CONSAT to leave transparency
        and if there is a stored message, the CONSAT sends the message to the
        terminal.

             (19) New login begins.

                               11.1  Purpose of Outdial


             Outdial will allow the same set of ports to accept incoming calls,
        and the  new capability  of making  calls.  This  will allow  hosts the
        added security  of being  able to dial  back to  users, hosts  to leave
        messages  to remote  PCs,  network users  access  to hosts  not  in the
        network,  and  other uses.   The  Consat  will still  be  able  to have
        hardwired terminals and accept incoming calls.






                           11.2  Network access for Outdial


             The  user will  log  into the  Consat through  a  standard network
        circuit.  The  Consat will  return a greeting  message, and  prompt the
        user for the desired command.






                              11.3  Outdial command mode


             While  in  command  mode  the user  enters  commands  in  order to
        establish an  Outdial connection.  Once  connected to  the destination,
        the originator leaves  command mode and  may not reenter.   Thus, these
        are distinct, separate states.

        Outdial                                                 August 19, 1987


                               11.4  Inactivity Timeout


             While in command mode, the user will be timed out after the period
        specified in the OUTHOST macro.  If not specified, the  default timeout
        is two minutes  of inactivity.  There  is no timeout  of any sort  on a
        completed call.






                                11.5  Outdial Commands


             The Outdial command mode will have seven commands.  They are DIAL,
        BPS, SET, RETRY, TERSE,  HELP, and LOGOUT.  The command  processor will
        accept shortened forms  of the commands in  both upper and  lower case.
        For example, the command processor will accept D, di, or even  DiAl, as
        the command DIAL, but not DIL.  All commands, except DIAL, must  have a
        space  between  the  command  and  the  value  field.   Control-H  will
        backspace  over the  last character  typed.  The  command line  will be
        terminated with a carriage return  (CR) or a linefeed (LF).  An  ESC or
        control-X will abort the current command line.





                    11.5.1  Dial Command

             The command Dial is to be followed by a phone number  field.  This
        field will  ignore blanks,  periods, parenthesis  and slashes,  but may
        contain three subcommands; T, P,  and ','.  The first two  specify Tone
        (default or Pulse dialing, respectively.  A comma causes a  short pause
        before Outdial will continue dialing.

             Example:  To dial an access number, then a slow  responding, pulse
        only switchboard the proper command  is DIAL T 555-1212 ,  555-1234 ,,P
        4444

             The  dial  command  is  the  last  command  to  be  issued.   If a
        successful connection is  made then the  circuit is completed.   If the
        call is not answered then  the originator is returned to  command mode.
        If  the call  was  answerred, but  connection  did not  occur  then the
        originator  is  logged  out.  Accounting  would  be  significantly more
        difficult if  the user  was allowed to  make another  call in  the same
        session.

             NOTE:   Certain  area  codes  can be  screened  out  by  a tymfile

                    11.5.2  Retry Command

             The RETRY  command redials  the last phone  number along  with all
        previously set options (such as baud rate).





                    11.5.3  BPS Command

             The command BPS sets the desired baud rate.  The value  field will
        contain the baud rate.  The baud rate will default to the highest speed
        possible.  This  will be limited  by the engine  configuration, Outdial
        modem,  and the  answering modem.   The Outdial  modem will  adjust its
        speed to the  speed of the answering  modem, but never faster  than the
        speed set by BPS.





                    11.5.4  SET Command

             The   SET  command   allows  the   user  to   set   some  terminal
        characteristics of the remote device.  The recognized value  fields are
        XON, RXON, EVEN,  SPACE, CRDELAY and HALF.   XON allows the  network to
        backpressure  the  remote device.   RXON  allows the  remote  device to
        backpressure  the network.   EVEN sets  even parity,  while  SPACE sets
        space parity.  CRDELAY causes a short delay after both CR and LF.  HALF
        sets half duplex.

             These and other terminal  characteristics can also be set  by ISIS
        messages.  If a value set by a B1 msg conflicts with a  value specified
        by the SET command,  the most recent value  is taken to be  the desired
        value.





                    11.5.5  LOGOUT Command

             LOGOUT zaps the circuit.  LOGOUT is only valid in command mode and
        before the command DIAL.  Once  a connection is made the  circuit stays
        up until either carrier is lost or a zapper is received.

                    11.5.6  TERSE Command

             The TERSE command  combines SET and  DIAL into one  command.  This
        allows the user to send  one string to specify all parameters  and make
        the  call.  TERSE  expects one  character parameters  in  the following
        order:  H (half-duplex) or N (no half-duplex), X (XON/XOFF  support) or
        N (no XON/XOFF support), R (reverse XON/XOFF support) or N  (no reverse
        XON/XOFF  support),  E (even  parity)  or  S (space  parity)  or  N (no
        parity), D (delay after carriage return) or N (no delay  after carriage
        return), an optional sixth character to specify speed (5 for 300 bps; 7
        for 1200 bps, and  8 for 2400 bps),  followed by the phone  number with
        any of the dial subcommands.  TERSE expects no spaces or punctuation in
        the five or six character parameter field.  For example, "T  NNREN5 555
        1234" sets RXON and even parity, and dials 555 1234 at 300  bps.  TERSE
        also returns numerical messages to the user.





                    11.5.7  HELP Command

             HELP  lists the  commands  and their  options.  The  TERSE  is not
        listed under the HELP command  since the TERSE command would  require a
        multi-page help  listing to  explain both the  command and  the digital
        response messages.






                               11.6  Accounting Addenda


             Outdial will use the following accounting messages.

        as strings of BCD digits; unused digits are padded with hex F;  only as
        many messages are sent as are required to contain the digits.

                               11.7  Modem Requirements


             Outdial will currently only work with the Concord Trispeed modems.
        Any other modem  to be used  in the future  with Outdial must  first be
        acceptable for use  as an indial modem.   The modem must also  have the
        following features:

             1)  The modem will be auto-dial and auto-answer.

             2)  The modem's command mode must be able to answer incoming calls
        and signal the Consat.  This prevents an incoming call  from connecting
        to an intended outgoing call.

             3)  The modem's dial command  should be able to wait for  a second
        tone or be able to pause a few seconds during dialing.

             4)  If the modem  changes speed after dialing  (while connecting),
        it must notify the Consat of the new speed at the old speed.

             5)  The modem must be able to accept some type of  command setting
        the maximum speed.

             6)   The  modem, once  connected,  should not  allow  the  user to
        reenter command mode.






              11.8  Macro:  OUTHOST(host,command ports,inactivity timer)


             OUTHOST is  the only  required macro and  must follow  the DECLARE
        macros.   OUTHOST(host,  command  ports,  inactivity  timer)  sets  the
        Outdial host number, the  maximum number of command ports  (default 16,
        maximum 32), and  the inactivity timer  for command ports  (default 120
        seconds).   The number  of command  port is  how many  users can  be in
        command mode at one time.   This does not affect the number  of Outdial
        connections.   For example,  four users  could be  in command  mode and
        forty people could have Outdial connections.






                          11.9  Macro:  OUTGREET(text string)


             OUTGREET(text string) sets Outdial's greeting message.






                         11.10  Macro:  OUTPROMPT(text string)


             OUTPROMPT(text string)  sets Outdial's  command prompt.   If used,
        the macro overrides the default command prompt (>).

               11.11  Macro:  OUTBAD(area code 1,...,area code N,label)


             OUTBAD(area  code 1,...,area  code N,label)  defines  illegal area
        codes  not  to  be  dialed.  If  the  label  OKINTER  is  included then
        international numbers can be dialed.  If the label BADINTER is included
        then international numbers as not dialable (default).

             If OUTBAD is specified then OUTGOOD may not be specified.






                  11.12  Macro:  OUTGOOD(area code 1,...,area code N)


             OUTGOOD(area code 1,...,area code N) defines the set of area codes
        than can be dialed, all area codes not included are illegal.

             If OUTGOOD is specified then OUTBAD may not be specified.






                       11.13  Outdial Configuration Verification


             The  inclusion  of  OUTHOST adds  the  Outdial  capability  to the
        Consat.  Use of the other three macroes without OUTHOST will be flagged
        as an assembly error.  If both OUTBAD and OUTGOOD are specified then an
        assembly error is printed  out during assembly.  Outdial will  not need
        tymfile parameters setting Outdial  capable ports or the type  of modem
        at the port.  Outdial will test  each modem to see if it has  a command
        mode and then determine the modem type.  Any modem with a  command mode
        (autodial capability) will be assumed to be an Outdial port.

             The host will be shut if less than one eighth of the command ports
        are free or less than  one sixteenth of the outdial capable  modems are
        free.

             The host will be reopened if more than one fourth of  the commands
        are  free and  more  than three  thirtyseconds of  the  outdial capable
        modems are free.

             If  neither of  the above  criteria is  met then  the  host status
        remains unchanged.






                              11.16  Circuit Limitations


             All of the current  circuit capabilities will still exist,  but no
        new features will be added.  Though the Outdial may build circuits from
        users  on a  Consat and  connect to  a host,  it will  not  perform the
        functions of a Tymcom.  Thus,  a Consat to Outdial circuit  cannot have
        local echo at either end.  This implies a Consat to Outdial  circuit is
        a virtual phone call with buffering capability.

             NOTE:  If  the origination and  destinations ports  have different
        bps set, the slower port must be able to backpressure the  faster port.
        Otherwise, data will be  lost due to the limited  bufferring capability
        of the network.   Thus, a slow origination  port should use the  BPS or
        SET RXON commands to set the destination to the same low speed.  A fast
        origination port should be  setup to allow the network  backpressure it
        (control-X or control-R at login).

             The following  list of macros  allows ports to  exhibit "enhanced"
        functions.  These functions include:  building circuits to  packet mode
        interfaces (such as  X.25 and X.75),  editing command strings  and user
        data,  and  dynamically altering  terminal  characteristics.   The main
        purpose  of these  enhanced functions  is CONSAT  support of  the CCITT
        X.3/X.28/X.29 Recommendations.  Most of these macros accept a  range of
        ports.

                The generic format for these macros is:
         
                     MACRO(A,...,P0,...,Pn)


             The name of the statement may start anywhere on a line.   Only the
        first six characters  are necessary for statement  identification.  The
        open parenthesis  "(" must  immediately follow  the name.   Options and
        port numbers are separated by commas.  The close parenthesis  ")", must
        follow  the last  option  or port  number.   Port numbers,  such  as P0
        through Pn, can  be specified as either  a decimal value, e.g.   1, for
        port #1; or a range of values, e.g.  0-7, for ports #0 through #7.






                 12.1  Macro:  AUTOCAll(CMDNAME,loginstream,p0,...,pe)


             This statement enables the user to define a command (to be used in
        command mode) that  will send a specified  login stream to  the network
        for the specified ports.  It may be invoked repeatedly up to 64 times.

                Syntax:   AUTOCAll(CMDNAME,loginstream,p0,...,pe)
                Default:  none

                CMDNAME = Any alphanumeric character stream to be used as the
                          command name.  The macro requires this character
                          stream to be specified in the tymfile in capital
                          letters.   
            loginstream = the exact login stream the user would normally be
                          required to type when placing a call while in command
                          mode.
                          (Note:  NAD special characters must use the hex

        tymfile,  then all  profiles numbering  3 and  greater will  have their
        Tymnet National parameter 103  overwritten with the value  specified by
        this macro.  This value will define a key to emulate the 'break key'.

                Syntax:   BRKRPL(key)
                Default:  Break key = 30
                Range:    0-255 (Decimal value)

                         12.3  Macro:  COMTIMer(min,p0,...,pe)


             This  statement  defines  the value  of  the  command  timer.  The
        command timer is started when the port enters command state and  has no
        calls  in  progress.   The  timer  is  halted  when  a  call  is  being
        established.   On  expiration  of  the  timer,  the  port  is  given  a
        diagnostic message and hung.

                Syntax:   COMTIMer(min,p0,...,pe)
                Default:  0 (off)
                Range:    0 to 255 minutes

                min = timer value, in minutes

                           12.4  Macro:  CUDUSErname(snchar)


             This statement specifies the value which will be used to  create a
        Call User Data Field for  calls that are placed through  our CONSAT/PAD
        from  a nonpacket  mode DTE  incapable of  constructing a  Call Request
        Packet.  The variable "snchar"  is a signed integer that  indicates the
        number of characters to extract from the username and place in the Call
        User  Data  Field.   A  positive  value  indicates  that  first  snchar
        character  will be  extracted  from the  username which  is  entered in
        CONSAT/PAD command Mode.  A negative value indicates the last character
        from the username should be extracted.  In both cases,  characters will
        be extracted from left to right.  If the number of characters  from the
        username is less than the value which has been defined by CUDUSE, zeros
        will fill the remaining bytes in the Call User Data Field.  This CUDUSE
        Statement is specified for all  ports which are going to  login through
        this interface.

                Syntax:   CUDUSErname(snchar)
                Default:  none

                     12.9  Macro:  EDITBUffersize(size,p0,...,pe)


             This statement determines the  size of the editing buffer  used in
        data transfer  mode.  If  more than the  maximum (size)  characters are
        input while in data transfer mode, editing is enabled (X.3 parameter 15
        is 1), and  no data forwarding conditions  have resulted in  data being
        sent, then  the entire editing  buffer will be  sent and a  new editing
        buffer created.   This will  occur automatically  and without  the port
        being notified.

                Syntax:   EDITBUffersize(size,p0,...,pe)
                Default:  128 characters

                     size - up to 255 characters

             12.10  Macro:  INCOMIngcalls(init,p0-pe,host,adr0-adr1,attr)


             This  capability will  not  be inherent  in  the PAD;  it  will be
        present only  if invoked.  This  statement then enables  incoming calls
        and  specifies  initially  whether  incoming  calls  will  be  answered
        automatically   or  ignored.    Initially,  incoming   calls   will  be
        automatically answered by a port configured with the AUTO option.  Once
        any login  characters are  typed, while in  login mode,  incoming calls
        will be ignored.  The OFF option initializes a port in command  mode to
        reject incoming calls.

             Two commands "RECEIVE" AND "REJECT" can enable or disable incoming
        calls if typed while in command mode.

             This macro can be invoked repeatedly for the same host  to provide
        the capability for several sets of ports.  It invokes the CONSAT ADRPRT
        macro  passing the  last four  arguments.  Please  refer to  the CONSAT
        Configuration for Port Addressing Section for further details.

                Syntax:   INCOMIngcalls(init,p0-pe,host,adr0-adr1,attr)

                init  = OFF     incoming calls must be explicitly answered
                        AUTO    incoming calls answered automatically
                p0-pe = Port range or logical port number
                host  = The host no. which will be used to target these ports

             This statement enables a  user, with terminal in command  mode, to
        place a call by entering an alphanumeric string terminated with a <CR>.
        When an alphanumeric string terminated  with a <CR> does not  match any
        X.28 CCITT Command or Tymnet Extended Command, it will be handled as if
        Call N<the alphanumeric String> were entered.

              The  following  restrictions  apply  to   a  CONSAT  which  
              is configured to provide PAD functions:

                   - MPVC ports cannot have PAD functions
                   - usernames may not contain the characters +  <CR>
                     , ; : - or any control characters
                   - passwords may not contain the characters + <CR> , ; -
                   - PAD enhanced options are currently only available to 
                     full duplex ASCII terminals
                   - PAD enhanced options are currently only available to
                     async (not SIO) ports







                                  13.1  Introduction


             The CONSAT interface has been enhanced to perform the functions of
        a PAD as defined by the CCITT in X.3, X.28, and X.29.  Several features
        have been  added to these  specifications in order  to make  the CONSAT
        easier to use (Clear Confirmation Message Test Section) and some slight
        departures from the standard  occur which give more flexibility  to the
        interface (Terminal Message Text Content Section).

             This  document gives  a  brief outline  of the  appearance  of the
        CONSAT to a user including the standard command set, a table of service
        signals (messages), and a  list of enhancements to and  departures from
        the  standard.   Knowledge  of  the  CONSAT  and  all   relevant  CCITT
        Recommendations  (X.3, X.28,  X.29, X.25)  is assumed  and will  not be
        reiterated here.

             The new configuration options  of the CONSAT are explained  in the
        PAD System Generation Section.

                    13.1.1  Modes of the CONSAT

             In addition  to the "login"  and "data transfer"  modes previously
        existing on a Tymsat, there is now a "command" mode from which X.28 and
        TYMNET extended commands may be executed.





                    13.1.2  Accessing the CONSAT modes

             The CONSAT may be configured (on a per port basis) to be initially
        in the  login or the  command mode.   The ability of  a port  to switch
        between these  modes is also  configurable.  If the  login mode  is the
        initial mode, then the "please  login:"  message is sent to a  port and
        the terminal  parameters is  set according to  profile 0  (internal use
        only).  If  the command mode  is the initial  mode, then a  "pad ready"
        message  is sent  followed  by a  command  prompt .   The  X.3 terminal
        parameters is set as specified by the default profile of a port.

             If a  port is so  configured, a user  may enter command  mode from
        login mode by typing the <break> key at any time up until  the password
        terminator  (or  username terminator  if  no password  is  required) is
        entered.  Whenever a port switch  from login mode to command  mode, the
        terminal parameters are set according to the default profile of a port.

             If  a port  is so  configured, a  user may  enter login  mode from
        command mode by entering the LOGIN command (eg.  login<CR>) at any time
        providing that  a call  is not  already in  progress.  Whenever  a port
        switch from command mode to login mode, the terminal parameters  is set
        according to profile 0 (internal use only - see Table 5 in  Appendix 2)
        for compatibility with those TYMSATs without the PAD enhancement.






                                13.2  TERMINAL COMMANDS


             The terminal commands may only  be executed when a port is  in the
        command mode and take one of two forms.  Only the first form applies if
        the port connected  to the terminal is  configured in the  "pure" CCITT
        X.28  command  mode.  The  commands  must be  entered  at  the terminal
        verbatim as the CCITT syntax is not at all forgiving.  The  second form
        applies if  the port is  configured to be  in the TYMNET  Extended X.28
        command mode.  The command names for this form may be typed in  full or
        may be abbreviated to as  few as three characters for all  commands and
        to one character for the Selection command (Call ...).

        PAD Command Mode and the X.28 PAD Enhancements Spec     August 19, 1987


             The commands affecting terminal parameters are summarized in Table
        1 and a summary of all commands appears in Table 4.

             The  command  formats  are described  according  to  the following
        syntax:  Brackets (ie.  [ and ]) are used to indicate that the enclosed
        information is optional  (eg.  [A][B] means that  both "A" and  "B" are
        optional).   Braces  (ie.  left  brace  and right  brace)  are  used to
        indicate  that  at  least  one  of  the  enclosed  parameters  must  be
        specified.   A slash  (ie.  /)  indicates an  "or" function  (eg.  left
        brace A/B/C right brace means that one of either "A" or "B" or "C" must
        be specified).  Command names are written in upper and lower case.

             The upper case portion must be entered, but the lower case portion
        is optional  (for ports  configured to operate  in the  TYMNET Extended
        mode).

             CONSAT command responses or unsolicited service signals consist of
        a mandatory and an optional (configurable) part.  The mandatory portion
        is written in upper  case (although it will  appear in lower case  on a
        terminal screen) and the optional portion is written in lower case.

             An  underscore (_)  indicates a  blank space  and must  be entered
        wherever specified if  the TYMNET Extended  mode of operation  is used,
        regardless of the  command length.  A question  mark (?)  must  also be
        entered wherever specified.





                    13.2.1  Service Request Signal (TID character)

             This  is really  a pseudo-command  and must  be entered  after the
        CONSAT has prompted the  terminal for a terminal  identifier regardless
        of the initial terminal mode.

             Since  only full  duplex ASCII  terminals are  currently supported
        under  the  PAD functions,  the  only valid  TIDs  correspond  to these
        terminal types (see "Important Notes" section for other restrictions).

             In addition to all TIDs that are supported in the  existing Tymsat
        interface, carriage return  <CR> can be used  as a TID to  set terminal
        characteristics similar to TID A with the exception of also setting the
        'parity attribute' to that of  the terminal for the port.  In  order to
        use the carriage return as a  TID, the tymfile must set the  CRTID flag
        to 1, (CRTID EQ 1).

                    13.2.2  Selection Command (Request for Call Establishment)

           CCITT Command:  Call_[fac1,fac2,...]-[adr][Pc1...c12]
                   or     Call_[fac1,fac2,...]-[adr][Dc1...c12]
                   or     Call_[fac1,fac2,...]-[.abbrevadr*][Pc1...c12]
                   or     Call_[fac1,fac2,...]-[.abbrevadr*][Dc1...c12]

             TYMNET Extended Command:  same as above and
                          Call_[fac1,fac2,...]-[adr][Ha1b1...a12b12]
                  or      Call_[fac1,fac2,...]-[.abbrevadr*][Ha1b1...a12b12]


             The selection command is used to make an outgoing call from  a DTE
        connected to  a CONSAT  port to a  remote DTE.   The parameters  of the
        command are as follows:



        13.2.2.1  Facilities for the call

             These are  separated by  commas (,)  and are  terminated by  a (-)
        dash.  They may consist of one or more of the following:

              N       - Network User Identification (NUI)
                        The "N" is followed by a username, and a
                        semicolon (;) and a password, if one is 
                        required for the username (see "Important
                        Notes" section for restrictions on 
                        username and password content)

              RPOa=nnnn The DNIC specified by nnnn is used as
                        the value of the RPOA facility

              TCLass=n  The throughput class (and TYMNET
                        gouging level) of the call are specified
                        by a value n which is a CCITT throughput
                        class value between 3 and 12 (inclusive).

              REVerse=n The reverse charging facility in a call
                        request is specified by a value n; n=1 for
                        reverse charging requested, n=0 for
                        reverse charging not requested.  The reverse
                        charging facility will not be included in a
                        call request if this facility ("REV=n") is
                        not included in the selection command.

              CUG=nn    The closed user group index number is specified
                        by a two decimal digit (in the range between
                        0 and 99) in a call request command.  The index
                        number will be used to find the associate 
                        interlock code.  Refer to macro CUG, CUGROUP and
                        CUGPREF in the PAD System Generation Section.

        13.2.2.2  Other Selection Command Parameters

              adr     - a full called address for the remote DTE which
                        consists of a (4 digit) DNIC and (up to 10 
                        digit) NTN.

            abbrevadr - an abbreviated address for the remote DTE.
                        This address consists of a 1 to 5 digit host 
                        number followed, optionally, by a dot (.) and a
                        1 to 4 digit subaddress (ie. hhhhh[.ssss]). The 
                        full (actual) address is constructed by the
                        CONSAT by prefixing the abbreviated address with
                        the DNIC of the network and sufficient zeros
                        to insure a 6 digit host number.

              P       - all characters following this delimiter will be
                        sent on the call as (ASCII) user data and will
                        NOT be echoed at the terminal.

              D       - all characters following this delimiter will be
                        sent on the call as (ASCII) user data and will
                        be echoed at the terminal if echo is on (ie. if
                        X.3 parameter 2 is 1).

              H       - all characters following this delimiter will be
                        interpreted as hexadecimal pairs, sent as call
                        user data, and will be echoed at the terminal
                        if echo is on (ie. if X.3 parameter 2 is 1).

              ci      - ASCII characters which make up the call user data

              aibi    - hexadecimal digit pairs which make up the call user 
                        data


             A  response  (acknowledgement)  service  signal  (ie.    a  format
        effector which is a  CR/LF) is sent to  the terminal upon receipt  of a
        correct  selection command.   An error  service signal  is sent  to the
        terminal upon  receipt of  an incorrect  selection command  (see Consat
        Servic Signals Section).

             A call progress service signal is sent to the terminal at  a later
        time indicating  the success or  failure of the  call set up  (see Call
        Progress Signals Section).

             The port is  in a half  duplex state between  the time at  which a
        selection command is entered and a call connected call progress service
        signal is issued.  Therefore, any characters entered during this period
        are  ignored without  comment (ie.   type ahead  is NOT  allowed during
        command mode login).

                    13.2.3  Clear Command

                              CCITT Command:  CLR
                    TYMNET Extended Command:  CLR_[diag] or CLEar_[diag]


             This command  instructs the  CONSAT to clear  a call.   The "diag"
        field allows the start-stop mode DTE to specify the clearing diagnostic
        to the remote DTE (if this would be meaningful).

                              CCITT Response: CLR CONF
                    TYMNET Extended Response: CLR CONF text


             The  response  indicates  that the  call  has  been  cleared.  See
        Section 4.2 for the "text" field contents.





                    13.2.4  Reset Call Command

                              CCITT Command:  RESET
                    TYMNET Extended Command:  RESet_[diag]


             A reset packet  will be sent through  the virtual circuit  if this
        command is entered.  The "diag" field allows a DTE to specify the reset
        diagnostic to the remote DTE.

                     CCITT Response: Acknowledgement service signal (ie. CR/LF)
           TYMNET Extended Response: Acknowledgement service signal

                    TYMNET Extended Command:  INTerrupt


             An interrupt  packet containing  an one  byte interrupt  user data
        (=01) is sent  to the remote  DTE, if this  command is entered  and the
        remote DTE is a packet  mode DTE.  The interrrupt command is  not valid
        on  a call  to non-packet  mode DTEs  and will  cause an  error service
        signal to be generated.

                    CCITT Response: Acknowledgement service signal (ie. CR/LF)
          TYMNET Extended Response: same as above

                      CCITT Command:  STAT
            TYMNET Extended Command:  STAtus


             This command is used to  ascertain the presence of a call  and the
        source and destination addresses of the call, if one is in progress.

                      CCITT Response: FREE or ENGAGED
            TYMNET Extended Response: <calling address> FREE
                      or              <calling address>
                                      ENGAGED <called address>


             The  called  address field  will  not be  displayed  if  no called
        address was given in the selection command.





                    13.2.7  Quit Command

            TYMNET Extended Command:  QUIt


             This command causes the CONSAT/PAD to drop DTR, thus  breaking the
        connection.





                    13.2.8  Receive Command

            TYMNET Extended Command:  RECeive


             This command allows incomingcalls for the port to be automatically
        accepted.  It can  be used to modify  the initial setting  specified by
        the incomingcalls  macro in  the tymfile.   It may  be reversed  by the
        "REJECT" command.

             This  command is  used to  change ("set")  the  terminal parameter
        profile  dynamically  by  the  terminal  user.   The  value  of  n must
        correspond to an already defined termianl profile number.

             The  TYMNET  Extended  commands allow  the  valid  profiles  to be
        listed.

             Table 5 of Appendix 1  should be consulted for a list  of standard
        profiles that can be defined on a per port bases.

             Please note  however Profile  zero (0) may  not be  specified with
        this command.  It is a valid profile only while in login mode.

             The  parameters of  a terminal  profile may  be queried  with this
        command.  The  "ni"'s correspond to  CCITT X.3 terminal  parameters and
        the "ti"'s correspond to the TYMNET National terminal  parameters.  The
        "0:0"  is a  National options  marker and  must be  used if  the TYMNET
        parameters are to be queried.

             If no parameter numbers  are entered after the command  (ie.  PAR?
        is entered) then all  terminal parameter numbers are listed  along with
        their values.

             The CCITT X.3 and  the TYMNET National terminal parameters  may be
        set using this command.  The command parameters are:

            ni      - CCITT X.3 parameter numbers
            vi      - CCITT X.3 parameter values
            0:0     - National options marker (delimits start of TYMNET
                      National terminal parameters)
            ti      - TYMNET National terminal parameter numbers

            value   - value associated with a single CCITT X.3 or TYMNET
                      National terminal parameter

                Note: If  no  parameters appear  in  the  SET command,
                      then all terminal parameters are set according  to

        terminal  parameters  or   both  to  be   set  and  then   queried  for
        verification.  The command parameter values are the same as in  the Set

            TYMNET Extended Command:  same as above


             This command causes the last character entered by the terminal (in
        data transfer state) to be deleted provided the editing function  is on
        and the character was not already forwarded by the CONSAT.  The editing
        function may always be used in  the command mode (but has no  effect on
        the selection command).

                                     echoed. If the character deleted is a Tab
                                     (hex 09), multiple <Backspace> is echoed.

                                     if the edit buffer contained no
                                     characters.

                A terminal parameter value may be set (changed) by entering a
                blank and a new value after the command name.

                example: ECHO_ON      - turns on the echo
                         WID_80       - sets the line width to 80 characters

                A set and read may be done by entering the command name
                followed by a question mark, a blank, and a new value.

                example: SERVICE?_5   - entered at the terminal
                         PAR6:5       - displayed at the terminal

             If the edit buffer is  overfilled in data transfer state,  then it

             If  the  edit  buffer  is overfilled  and  command  state,  then a
        diagnostic message  is displayed  and the buffer  is emptied.   In this
        case, a carriage return must  be typed before the CONSAT will  begin to
        again accept input.

             The selection command will be aborted and the call cleared  if the
        escape  from  data  transfer character  is  entered  during  the period
        between the terminator  of the selection command  (ie.  + or  <CR>) and
        the call connected service signal.

                    13.7.2  Enhancements of the CONSAT from the CCITT PAD Stds

             When  a call  is  cleared from  data transfer  state  (eg.  logoff
        command issued  to a  host), the CONSAT  will return  to the  mode from
        which the call was placed (ie.  login or command mode).

             The  CONSAT  service  signals provide  more  information  than the
        standard X.28  types.  In many  cases, a (SYSGEN  configurable) message
        follows the service signal type detailing what actually happened.  This
        is particularly useful  in the cases where  a command is  misspelled or
        the command name is different  from that which is entered.  It  is also
        useful if  a command  affecting a  call is  entered but  no call  is in
        progress.

             A new data forwarding value has been added to  allow compatibility
        between  the new  PAD function  of locally  assembling  characters into
        packets  and  the  usual  CONSAT  character-at-a-time  data  forwarding
        method.  The  value 128 means  that data forwarding  will occur  on all
        characters not covered by the preceding value of 127 (eg.   spaces, at-
        signs).

             When data forwarding on each character is desired, X.3 parameter 3
        should be set to 255 and  editing disabled (X.3 parameter 15 set  to 0)
        as editing  would not  be meaningful.   The idle  timer should  also be
        disabled (X.3  parameter 4  set to 0)  as this  function is  not needed
        either when each character is forwarded as soon as it is typed.

                      APPENDIX I.   Automatic Login String Syntax



             When  the  ALO  option  is  specified,  the  default  username and
        password generated by the CONSAT are based on the originating  node and
        port numbers.  The format is as follows:
              XXnnnnppppYY;Pppppnnnnssss <CR>

              where   XX = literally the letters 'XX'
                    nnnn = node number (in octal)
                    pppp = port number on the CONSAT (in octal).  The first
                           digit specifies the slot number.
                      YY = literally the letters 'YY'  
                       P = literally the letter 'P' 
                    ssss = zero to  four character  security sequence  
                           supplied by the user at system generation
                           time (see Section 3.2.4)


             XXnnnnppppYY  is  the  generated  user  name.   The  semicolon (;)
        terminates the user name and indicates login to the default destination
        host.  Pppppnnnnssss is the generated password, and is terminated  by a
        carriage return.  The generated username and password with  an optional
        security sequence must be validated on the Supervisor.

                        APPENDIX III.   ISIS-Specific features



             Certain features  of the CONSAT  are environment  specific.  Since
        these are of interest to users, they are described here.






                              III-1  Front Panel Display


             The CONSAT generates a 4-digit display for the Engine Front Panel.
        The contents of the display will vary according to certain options.





                    III-1.1  Configuration Errors

             Certain configuration errors may not be detected until  the CONSAT
        is executing.  If this is so, the display is fixed (see Figure III.1.).

                      Figure III.1.  Configuration Error Display:

                --------+-------+-------+--------
                | TYPE  |     Device Number     |
                --------+-------+-------+--------

               Where:


               TYPE    Device  Type  -- unable  to  locate  a configured
                       device of this type:

                1       ASYNC Group
                2       Printer
                3       SIO Port

               Number  The  number of  the first  such device  not found
                       (e.g. if configured for  3 SIO ports, and  only 2
                       are available, the display would show "3002".

                    III-1.2  Normal Display

             The  "normal"  display  presents  information  on  usage.   It  is
        distinguished from  the configuration error  by "flashing"  (see Figure
        III.2.).

                        Figure III.2.  "Normal" Error Display:

                --------+-------+-------+--------
                |F|    USE      |  No. of Ports |
                --------+-------+-------+--------

               Where:


               F       Flashing Bit -- Flashes on and off.

               USE     Displays  the average  (averaged over  16 cycles)
                       interval between iterations of the EXEC  loop, in
                       units of Clock-Ticks.

               No.     The Number of ISIS ports currently active.





                    III-1.3  CPS Display

             The CONSAT  may be set  to monitor ASYNC  Characters/Second (CPS).
        In that case, the normal display alternates with the CPS  display, with
        an elapsed interval of 1.7 seconds for each type of display.

             The  CPS  display  is  further  divided  into  "short"  and "long"
        measurements:

                  T (seconds)
                 0.0    normal display
                 1.7    "short" display
                 3.4    normal display
                 5.1    "short" display
                 6.8    normal display
                ....
                23.8    normal display
                25.5    "long" display ("blinks")
                27.2    normal display (repeat sequence)

             The  "short"  display  presents  the  CPS  transfered  during  the
        previous 3.4 seconds.

             The  "long"  display  presents  the  CPS  transferred  during  the
        previous  54.4  second  interval.   This  display  "blinks" (alternates

        displays.






                              III-2  DDT Control Features


             In ISIS-DDT, the "?STAT" command connects the DDT user to  an ISIS
        CONSAT control process.





                    III-2.1  QUIT or Q

             This exits ?STAT and returns to DDT.





                    III-2.2  EXIT or EXI

             This logs off from DDT and zaps the circuit.





                    III-2.3  CODE

             This tells  the code, version,  time it was  loaded, time  of last
        crash and the current time.  The time when the code was  last assembled
        is also displayed.  The time is Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).

             This starts a debugging routine which then prompts for one  of the
        following commands:

            Ixxxx   - displays the IRING for xxxx (hex) seconds.
            Oxxxx   - displays the ORING for xxxx (hex) seconds.
            Bxxxx   - displays both rings for xxxx (hex) seconds.

             The selected ring is displayed from the beginning of the ring upto
        the current fill  pointer along with any  future activity for  the next
        xxxx hex seconds.  This monitoring routine is exitted by  either typing
        any key or after timer expired.  The xxxx value field is  optional.  If
        it  is not  included then  the  ring are  displayed up  to  the present
        pointer and  then the user  is returned to  XDDT.  The value  field may
        contain up to 8 hex digits.

                                  III-4  Crash table


             CRAT is the crash table  entry, read 4C bytes will dump  the crash
        table.  The data storages are assigned as follows:

        CRSHCT  HS      1       :crash count...how many times crashed
        CRASHC  HS      1       :crash code (initiated to manual restart)
        CPOINT  HS      2       :where crash occured
        CFROM   HS      2       :where crash was called from
        CRXREG  HS      20      :registers at time of crash (registers 0 - 15)
        CRTIME  WS      1       :real time of crash (GMT)

             The tymfile option  CRSTOP may be  set to 0 or  1. If 1  the crash
        routine will be executed only once.  The default value is 0.

             The tymfile option NCRSAV defines the number of crash tables to be
        saved.  It will be set to 3 by default. Reading 4C bytes  from location
        CRAT will dump the last crash table and reading 4C bytes  from location
        CRAT+50 (real time of crash  included, so 4 bytes is  incremented) will
        dump the previous crash table and so on.

             The tymfile  option EXCRSH may  be set  to 0 or  1. It  allows the
        extended crash  processing to  be executed. EXCRSH  is defaulted  to 1.
        Under this option, another tymfile option  CHIST may be set to 0  or 1.
        If 1, the I/O ring information at the crash time will be saved. Reading
        ORSIZE+4  bytes from  location  SVORPT will  dump 2  halfword  of Oring
        pointer and all Oring information. Reading IRSIZE+4 bytes from location
        SVIRPT will dump 2 halfword of Iring pointer and all Iring information.

             Although this example illustrates the results of a  device failure
        at the terminating  end, there are many  other possible causes  for the
        failure of a network circuit to complete.  Some of these are SPACE from
        originating device,  CONSAT failure  at either  end, bad  PVC username,
        terminating port already connected, and so on.

             If  the network  circuit  is zapped  for any  reason,  both CONSAT
        connections will supply SPACE  to the devices.  Also, if  either device
        resumes sending SPACE, the network connection will be zapped.

             Notes:
             1. The possible values of the escape from data transfer character
                as specified by "n" are:
                     0       - escape from data transfer impossible
                     1       - 1/0(DLE) is the escape character
                     2-31    - the ASCII character having this value is the
                               escape character (but only when the interface is
                               configured in the TYMNET Extended mode of
                               operation)
                     32-127  - the ASCII character having this value is the
                               escape character
                Control-A and NUL can never be escape characters.

             2. The data forwarding characters corresponding to values of "n"
                are:
                     0       - no data forwarding characters
                     1       - alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9)
                     2       - CR
                     4       - ESC, BEL, ENQ, ACK
                     8       - DEL, CAN, DC2
                    16       - ETX, EOT
                    32       - HT, LF, VT, FF
                    64       - all other characters not in columns 0 and 1 not
                               included in the above
                   128       - all other characters not included in the above
           
                A combination of  these values may be  used in place of  a
                single value  as shown  in Table  1/X.3  (eg. 3  means all
                alphanumeric characters and carriage return).

             3. Service signals are sent to the DTE based on the values:
                     0       - no service signals
                     1       - service signals other than the prompt
                     4       - prompt service signal

                     A combination of these values may also be used.

             4. The result of a break character being received from the
                terminal is determined by the following values of "n":
                     0       - no action
                     1       - send interrupt packet
                     2       - reset
                     4       - send Indication of Break (X.29 or break
                               message)
                     8       - escape from data transfer state
                    16       - discard output to the DTE

                A combination of  these values may be  used in place of  a
                single value as shown in Table 1/X.3.

             5. The terminal speed may be further divided into input and output
                speeds using TYMNET National parameters 5 and 6.

             6. Valid terminal rates as specified by "n" are CCITT
                representations of actual terminal speeds as listed below.

                     Actual Speed            CCITT Representation
                     110 bits/s                       0
                     300 bits/s                       2
                    1200 bits/s                       3
                    2400 bits/s                      12
                    4800 bits/s                      13
                    9600 bits/s                      14

             7. Multiple values are used to indicate in which direction(s) the
                linefeeds are to be inserted (combinations of values may also
                be used).
                     0 - no linefeed insertion
                     1 - after each carriage return in the data stream to the
                         DTE
                     2 - after each carriage return in the data stream from the
                         DTE
                     4 - after each carriage return in the echo to the DTE

             The following profiles are currently  supported by the  CONSAT.  A
        "T"   in  the   value   field means   that  the   parameter   value  is
        determined by the terminal identifier  (TID) entered when  contact with
        the  CONSAT is   first  made  (ie.   by the  service   request signal).
        The TID may  be the same as was used  for the unenhanced CONSAT.
