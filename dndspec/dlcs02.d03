        This system generation reference manual provides the information
        necessary
        to define and generate a TYMNET QLLC/SDLC Interface to provide
        access between
        SDLC protocol terminals and hosts, or SDLC protocol terminals or
        hosts and
        QLLC protocol terminals and hosts, utilizing the packet-switched
        transmission
        facilities of TYMNET. This manual is directed to network analysts
        and network
        programmers for defining a TYMNET SDLC Interface.


        Prerequisites to use this manual are a basic understanding of
        teleprocessing,
        a general knowledge of SDLC protocol, QLLC protocol, X.25  and a
        general
        knowledge of the purpose of the TYMNET QLLC/SDLC Interface. These
        may be
        obtained from the following documents:

        SECTION 1.0 OVERVIEW        _______ ___ ________


        TYMNET SDLC interfaces with primary and secondary  ports  provide
        access  between  SDLC  protocol terminals and hosts utilizing the
        packet- switching data transmission  services  of  TYMNET.   Both
        Normal  Response  Mode (NRM) and Normal Disconnect Mode (NDM) are
        supported.

        No hardware or software changes are normally required at the host
        computer.   Nonswitched,  full  or half duplex, point-to-point or
        multipoint links to hosts are supported.  A secondary  port  will
        appear  to  the  host computer as a single secondary station on a
        point-to-point link or as a number of  secondary  stations  on  a
        multipoint link.

        No hardware or  software  changes  are  required  at  the  remote
        terminal.   Nonswitched,  full  or half duplex, point-to-point or
        multipoint links to terminals are supported.  A primary port will
        appear  to  attached  terminals on a point-to-point or multipoint
        link as a primary station.

        The TYMNET SDLC interface supports Physical Unit types 1, 2,  and
        4, and is transparent to all Logical Unit types.

        SECTION 2.0 SYSTEM GENERATION        _______ ___ ______ __________


        2.0.1 TYMFILE              _______

        Configuration  of  an  SDLC   interface   requires   a   TYMFILE.
        Basically,   a   TYMFILE   is  a  file  which  contains  all  the
        configuration-related statements necessary for the generation  of
        a   Slot   code   for  a  particular  configuration.   All  these
        configuration-related   statements   are   represented   by   the
        System-defined  macro  statements, which are further divided into
        four categories.  They are control-directives, network  and  ISIS
        statements, Monitor statements, and SDLC-station statements


QLLC/SDLC Interface SYSGEN Reference Manual                        Page 9


        SECTION 2.1 CONFIGURATION MACROS        _______ ___ _____________ ______


        2.1.1 HIERARCHY OF SDLC-STATION STATEMENTS              _________ __ ____________ __________

        An SDLC interface may be  viewed  as  a  logical  arrangement  of
        elements,   each   kind   of   elements   occupying  a  different
        hierarchical level within the  category  of  macros  called  SDLC
        configuration aggregate-macros.

        The highest element is the protocol group, either a primary or  a
        secondary  group.  Each group in an SDLC interface is represented
        by a GROUP aggregate-macro.

        The next element is the communication line (or link).  Each  line
        in  an  SDLC  interface is represented by a LINE aggregate-macro,
        whether  the  line  is  non-switched   multipoint,   non-switched
        point-to-point, or switched point-to-point.

        The last element in the hierarchical levels is SDLC  station  (or
        port).  Each SDLC station is represented by a PU aggregate-macro,
        which represents the physical unit within the SDLC station.


        2.1.2 ITEM MACROS              ____ ______

        To supply  further  detailed  configuration  information  for  an
        aggregate-macro,   several   item-macros   are   defined.    Each
        individual   item-macro   clearly    specifies    a    particular
        characteristic,   property  or  function  pertinent  to  an  SDLC
        station, SDLC link, or SDLC group.


        2.1.3 ADVANTAGE OF HIERARCHY              _________ __ _________

        The principal advantage of macro hierarchy is that it provides  a
        logical  structure.   In  addition,  it saves coding effort.  For
        example, each of five characteristics common to  all  of  fifteen
        SDLC  stations  on  a  link  can  be  specifiee, in the LINE
        aggregate-macro, rather than in each of the fifteen individual PU
        aggregate-macros.

        The characteristic need not  to  be  identical  for  all  of  the
        elements  at  a  level  to specify it at a higher level.  You may
        code the exceptions at the lower level;  any  characteristic  you
        code   at   the   lower   level   automatically   overrides   the
        characteristic specified at the previous higher level.   If,  for
        example,  only  ten  of the fifteen stations mentioned previously
        have the same characteristics in common, you could still  specify
        that  characteristic  in  the  LINE  level-macro,  then you would
        specify the differing characteristics in the PU level-macros  for
        the five exceptional stations.

        Section 3.1 contains a sample TYMFILE that illustrates the  macro
        coding sequences.

        Section 2.1.4 SUMMARY OF MACROS                      _______ __ ______

        Figure 2.1 lists all of the item-macros  of  the  SDLC  interface
        configuration  macros for SDLC links.  The asterisk indicates the
        macro under which the  description  of  the  item  appears.   The
        plus(+) indicates other aggregate-macros in which the item may be
        coded.

        This summary does not indicate the conditions (for example,  type
        of  line  control,  type  of  station)  under  which  the item is

        SECTION 2.2 CONTROL DIRECTIVES        _______ ___ _______ __________


        This section describes those statements which  primarily  control
        the   print-out   of  the  configuration  parameter  listing.   A
        configuration  parameter  listing  is  the  listing  of  all  the
        resulting functions and characteristics of an SDLC interface in a
        summary and easily-readable form on the  user's  ASCII  terminal.
        Please  see  section  3.3  for  a  sample configuration parameter
        listing.


        2.2.1 PRINT/NOPRINT              _____________

        Syntax:  PRINT
                 NOPRINT

        Description:  The 'PRINT' and 'NOPRINT' control  directives  turn
                 the  configuration  parameter  listing switch on and off
                 respectively.  The user can insert these statements  any
                 places  in  a  Tymfile.   Please  be  noted  that  these
                 statements have  no  affects  on  the  regular  assembly
                 listing.  Also, they have no affects on the BEGINTYM and
                 ENDTYM statements below.

        Default:  If none of the these two statements is coded before any
                 other   configuration   statements,   the  configuration
                 parameter listing for those statements are listed on the
                 terminal.


        2.2.2 BEGINTYM              ________

        Syntax:  BEGINTYM

        Description:  This statement denotes the begining of  a  Tymfile,
                 and  prints  the  title  of  the configuration parameter
                 listing.  The version number and revision level of  this
                 SDLC   interface   are  also  part  of  a  configuration
                 parameter listing title.  All  of  this  information  is
                 listed whenever a BEGINTYM statement is coded in an SDLC
                 interface Tymfile.

        Default:  If this statement is  omitted,  then  no  configuration
                 parameter  listing  title  is  printed.   However, it is
                 strongly recommended that this statement be coded in  an
                 SDLC interface Tymfile as the 'FIRST' statement.


        2.2.3 ENDTYM              ______

        Syntax:  ENDTYM

        Description:  This statement denotes the end of  a  Tymfile,  and
                 triggers the checking procedures for a consistent system
QLLC/SDLC Interface SYSGEN Reference Manual                       Page 13


                 configuration for this SDLC interface, A  final  section
                 of  the  configuration  parameter listing which contains
                 consistency checking messages will be  printed,  if  any
                 in-consistency existed in the SDLC interface Tymfile.

        Default:  If this statement  is  omitted,  then  the  consistency
                 checking  procedures  are  bypassed.   Therefore,  it is
                 strongly recommended that this statement be coded in  an
                 SDLC interface Tymfile as the last statement.

                  Note 1. Begintym should be the first or the second
                          statement of a TYMFILE. The only statement
                          which could be in front of BEGINTYM is
                          PRINT/NOPRINT.
                  Note 2. ENDTYM should be the last statement of a

        SECTION 2.3 NETWORK AND ISIS STATEMENTS        _______ ___ _______ ___ ____ __________


        This section describes those statements which primary purpose  is
        to  specify  the  internal  constraints and characteristics of an
        SDLC interface.  These internal constraints  and  characteristics
        are  pertinent  to  the  network  technology  employed inside the
        TYMNET or the system rules related to  the  ISIS  system.   Here,
        ISIS  (which stands for the Internally Switched Interface System)
        is a system which contains a set of rules as to how the different
        interfaces are to be constructed, and how they are to communicate
        with each other.   For  more  detailed  information  about  ISIS,
        please see ISIS-II Internally Switched Interface System REFERENCE                   _______ __________ ________ _________ ______ _________
        MANUAL.  Also, please be noted that the SDLC interfaces are  only        ______
        compatible with the ISIS-II system.


        2.3.1 SYSTEM              ______

        Syntax:  SYSTEM(arg)
                 where arg = TYMNT1 or TYMNT2

        Description:   This  statement  specifies  the  internal  network
                 technology  employeed in handling network services.  the
                 SDLC Interface can be compatible with either TYMNET-I or
                 TYMNET-II.

        Default:  This statement may be  omitted,  then  the  default  is
                 TYMNT2.


        2.3.2 FREEZE              ______

        Syntax:  FREEZE(arg)
                 where arg = YES, or NO

        Description:  These statements specify whether the SDLC interface
                 should  stop,  should  a  crash  occur.   A 'crash' is a
                 mechanism implemented in  the  SDLC  interface  to  trap
                 either  the  hardware  or  software  problems.   After a
                 'crash' occurred and  the  SDLC  interface  frozen,  the
                 frozen  SDLC  interface code could be dumped into a disk
                 file or directly 'looked' into by  a  qualified  network
                 analyst  or  network developper to analyze and debug the
                 trapped problem.

        Default:  If none of FREEZE statements  is  specified,  then  the
                 SDLC  interface  restarts  immediately,  should  a crash
                 happen.


        2.3.3 TIMEZONE              ________

        Syntax:  TIMEZONE(n)
                 where t = -23d to 23d
QLLC/SDLC Interface SYSGEN Reference Manual                       Page 15


        Description:  This statement specifies the  necessary  correction
                 value  which  should  be the time-zone correction factor
                 from  coordinated  universal  time.   For  example,  the
                 time-zone  correction  value  for PACIFIC SAVING TIME is
                 -8d.

        Default:   If  this  statement  is  omitted,  then  the   default
                 time-zone is Pacific Saving Time.


        2.3.4 ISISRING              ________

        Syntax:  ISISRING(n1,n2)
                 where n1 is IRSIZE, and n2 is ORSIZE

        Description:  IRSIZE and ORSIZE are the sizes of input  ring  and
                 output  ring  for  the  internal  ISIS  dispatcher logic
                 respectively.  These values  should  be  a  multiple  of
                 four.   The recommended ring size is the total number of
                 input or output characters that may be  expected  to  be
                 received  from  or transmitted to the network in any one
                 second period.

        Default:  The default values  for  IRSIZE  and  ORSIZE  are  both
                 4092d.


        2.3.5 BUFSIZE              _______

        Syntax:  BUFSIZE(n)
                 where n is value in bytes and must be greater that 8d

        Description:  This statement defines the buffer size for internal
                 buffers.   The  size of the buffer should be selected to
                 best utilize the available memory spaces.

        Default:  If this statement is omitted, then the default size  is
                 140d bytes.


        2.3.6 PVCTIMER              ________

        Syntax:  PVCTIMER(t)
                 where t is time in seconds

        Description:  This statement specifies the waiting time  required
                 before  the  interface starts to build the circuit again
                 after a circuit  is  cleared  due  to  various  reasons.
                 Since certain internal clean-up procedures are needed to
                 be performed before a new circuit can be  re-built,  the
                 value specified should be greater than 30 seconds.

        Default:  If this statement is omitted, then the default value is
                 60d seconds.

        2.3.7 MSIOTP              ______

        Syntax:  MSIOTP(arg)
                 where arg = M.TYP0 or M.TYP1.

        Description:  This statement specifies sio  micro  code  version.
                 Argument  M.TYP0  is defined to be the version type D or
                 earlier, M.TYP1 is defined to be the version type  E  or
                 latter.

        Default:  If this statement is ommitted, then the  default  value
                 is M.TYP0.


        2.3.8 ODNIC              _____

        Syntax:  ODNIC(n)

                 where n = Data Network I.D.  for  this  interface.   The
        ODNIC must be 4 digits long.

        Description:  This statement  describes  the  Data  Network  I.D.
                 used for this interface.  This value is used to validate
                 the called address received on incoming calls.

        Syntax:  MONITOR(host#)

        Description:  This statement specifies that this  SDLC  interface
                 has  the  monitor  function  capability, and at the same
                 time defines the  host  #  for  the  monitor.   All  the
                 following statements in this section are meaningful only
                 when this statement is included.

        Default:  If the monitor function is desired, this statement must
                 be   included;    otherwise,   no  monitor  function  is
                 supported in this interface.

        Syntax:  UPD.INTERVAL(t)
                 where t = time, in minutes

        Description:  This statement specifies the  refresh  interval  in
                 minutes for the monitor to refresh its displays.

        Default:  If this statement is omitted, the default  interval  is
                 one minute.


        2.4.4 MBUFQA              ______

        Syntax:  MBUFQA(n)
                 where n = number of buffers

        Description:  This statement specifies the buffer quota  assigned
QLLC/SDLC Interface SYSGEN Reference Manual                       Page 19


                 for  each  monitor  output  port.  The buffer size is as
                 defined in 2.3.5.

        Default:  If this statement is omitted, the default value is  ten
                 buffer for each monitor port.


        2.4.5 MLOG.TBL              ________

                 where n = number of entries in the log table

        Description:   This  statement  specifies  the  total  number  of
                 entries  in  the  log  table.  The log table records the
                 exceptional events occur in  the  SDLC  Interface  after
                 this  Interface  is  initially  loaded  into the ENGINE.
                 Each entry in the table is 10d  bytes  long.   The  data
                 recorded  for  an  event  include  the time when such an
                 event occurs, the event code, and  the  associated  line
                 and/or  station number.  When the log table is full, the
                 new event log will be written into the  log  table  from
                 the begining of the table, and the oldest entries may be
                 lost.

        Default:  If this statement is omitted,  the  default  number  of
                 entries for the log table is 50d.

                 interface  has  not  received from the external system a
                 response to polling, or to message  text,  it  makes  no
                 further attempt to communicate with the external system.
                 Instead, it indicates that a timeout error has occurred.
                 For secondary lines this macro has no effect.

        Default:  If this statement is omitted, the default  value  is  3
                 seconds.

                 seconds, for the lines in this line group.   If  at  the
                 expiration  of  this interval the SDLC interface has not
                 received from the network a response to polling, to  XID
                 message,  or  to  TEST  message,  it makes an attempt to
                 switch from the state of waiting  for  a  response  from
                 network  to the state of checking any polling or message
                 text from the external system.  The timer  defines  here
                 should  not  greater  than  the timer defines in REPLYTO
                 macro for proper performance.

                 primary and secondary are switched.




        2.5.16 SNRMRETRIES               ___________

        Syntax:  SNRMRETRIES(m,t,n)
                 where m = number, t = time in 1/10 seconds, n = number

        Description:  This statement specifies the number of SNRM retries
                 with two different aspect for TIF or HIF.

                 As to the TIF side, SNRMRETRIES specifies the number  of
                 SNRMs  sent  to CU from TIF.  Whenever TIF receives SNRM
                 from TIF, it transmits the SNRM  to  CU,  sets  the  1st
                 argument  of  SNRMRETRIES as SNRM retry counter.  If the
                 UA does not  returned  from  from  CU,  then  TIF  sends
                 another  SNRM  when  the PAU.LN times out.  When the 1st
                 argument of SNRM retry reaches 0, TIF checks if the  2nd
                 argument  which is the SNRM pause timer is 0 or not.  If
                 2nd argument is set to 0, then the retry  activities  is
                 stoped  (Since  the  2nd  argument  t  is  0,  the third
                 argument n which is the retry sequence must be 0;   that
                 means,  only the retries specified in the 1st argument m
                 is attempts).  This macro is used in the line level, the
                 default value for the TIF is (1,0,0) that means only one
                 retry is attempted.

                 If n is omitted and t is not 0, then n = 0;  that  means
                 ,  the  retries  specified  in  the  1st  argument  m is
                 attempted.

                 If n is omitted and t is 0, n = 0 is assumed.

                 As to the HIF side, SNRMRETRIES specifies the number  of
                 SNRM  ignored  by  HIF in between the SNRMs sent accross
                 the network.  Whenever HIF gets the SNRMs from fron  end
                 processor and the SNRMSK is not set, HIF sets the SNRMSK
                 during  the  retry  condition  and  decrements  the  1st
                 argument  m.   When the 1st argument m reaches 0, SNRMSK
                 is cleared and HIF will be able  to  receive  SNRM  from
                 front  end  processor again.  The interval timer between
                 each SNRM ignored by HIF is TNR.LN.  For the  reason  of
                 complexity  of HIF code, the 2nd t and 3rd argument n is
                 always set to 0 without choices.  The default  valu  for
                 HIF  is (5,0,0), and this macro is specified in the line
QLLC/SDLC Interface SYSGEN Reference Manual                       Page 27


                 level.

                 The t and n of HIF should always set to 0 without  other
                 choices.

        Default:  If this statement is omitted, the  assumed  value  will
                 (1,0,0) for TIF, (5,0,0) for HIF.


        2.5.17 RCVTORETRIES               ____________

        Syntax:  RCVTORETRIES(m)
                 where m = number of retries while receive timout occurs

        Description:  This statement specifies the number of  retries  of
                 either  RR/RNR  depends  on  the  busy condition of TIF.
                 When a receive timeout occured to  TIF,  TIF  decrements
                 TOTRLN  counter  and  sends  RR/RNR  to  CU.   If TOTRLN
                 reaches 0, TIF enters into HPINOP and sends DM  to  HIF,
                 then enters into HPNDM.  This macro is generated in line
                 level, and is used in TIF only.  The  default  value  of
                 this retry counter is 12.

                 Default:  If this  statement  is  omitted,  the  assumed
                 value will be m=12.


        2.5.18 DISCRETRIES               ___________

        Syntax:  DISCRETRIES(m)
                 where m = number

        Description:  This DISCRETRIES counts the number of DISC sent  to
                 CU,  while  waiting to enter into NDM.  Whenever network
                 circuit is down, TIF sends  DISC  to  CU  several  times
                 until  the  contents  in  SCBDIS  reaches  0.  The retry
                 counter of DISC is DISRLN, and used by TIF  only.   This
                 macro  is  used in line level, and the default number is
                 4.

        Default:  If this statement is omitted, the assumed value will be
                 m=4.


        2.5.19 XIDRETRIES               __________

        Syntax:  XIDRETRIES(m)
                 where m = number

        Description:  The XIDRETRIES macro is used  by  HIF  only.   This
                 retry  counter  counts  the  number of XIDs ignored from
                 host in between XIDs sent accross the network.  Whenever
                 HIF  gets  XID  from  front  end  processor, it sets the
                 XIDRLN into SCBXRD (SCBLKS).  HIF ignores the number  of
                 XIDs  during  the  XIDMSK on situation.  When this retry
QLLC/SDLC Interface SYSGEN Reference Manual                       Page 28


                 counter reaches 0, XIDMSK is  cleared.   This  macro  is
                 specified  in  line level for HIF use only.  The default
                 value is 5.

        Default:  If this statement is omitted, the assumed value will be
                 m=5.

        Syntax:  TESTRETRIES(m)
                 where m = number

        Description:  The TESTRETRIES macro is used by  HIF  only.   This
                 retry  counter  counts  the number of TESTs ignored from
                 host  in  between  TESTs  sent  accross   the   network.
                 Whenever HIF gets XIDs from front end processor, it sets
                 the TESTLN into SSTRTN (SCBLKS).  HIF ignores the number
                 of  TESTs  during  the  TSTMSK  on situation.  When this
                 retry counter reaches 0, TSTMSK is cleared.  This  macro
                 is  specified  in  line  level  for  HIF  use only.  The
                 default value is 5.

        Default:  If this statement is omitted, the assumed value will be
                 m=5.

                 where t = timer (minutes)

        Description:  The RNRXMTRETRIES macro is used by TIF only.   This
                 retry timer specifies how many minutes that the TIF will
                 send RNR to CU, and is not able to get out  of  the  RNR
                 transmit  loop  due to network congestion.  If the timer
                 specified in this RNRXLN expires, TIF gives up trying by
                 entering into HPBUSY, then NDM.

                 If m = 0FF minutes, the infinitive RNR transmit retry is
                 attempts.   The  default  value  of  this  RNR  transmit
                 retries is 10 minutes before going into NDM.  This macro
                 is defined in the line level, and is used by TIF only.

        Default:  If this statement is omitted, the assumed value will be
                 m=10.


                 2.5.22 RNRRCVRETRIES                        _____________

                 Syntax:  RNRRCVRETRIES(t)

                 receive consecutive RNR from CU, and is not able to  get
                 out  of  the  RNR receive loop due to the station's busy
                 condition or problem.  If the timer  specified  in  this
                 RRNRLN  expires, TIF gives up trying by entering HPBUSY,
                 then NDM.

                 If m = 0FF minutes, the inifinitive RNR receive retry is
                 attempt.   The default value of this RNR receive retries
                 is 10 minutes before going  into  NDM.   This  macro  is
                 defined in the line level, and is used by TIF only.

                 RR or RNR for the lines in this group for TIF only.  for
                 the lines in this line group.  SDLC interface will  wait
                 for  t*1/10 sec, before sending another RR or RNR to the
                 secondary station.  After this action has been taken for
                 several  timer  for  RNR  only  (see  RNRXMTRETRIES), no
                 further attempt to communicate with the external system.
                 Instead,  the  TIF enters into HPNDM.  The default value
                 for point-to-point  configuration  is  2*1/10  sec  ,for
                 multi-point configuration is 0.

        Description:  This statement specifies the  average  duration  of
                 the  polling  cycle  in 1/10 seconds.  The polling cycle
                 extends from the moment polling begins  with  the  first
                 active  entry  in the service running list to the moment
                 polling next begins at the  same  entry.   If  the  time
                 expended  in  a  complete  polling  cycle-  this  is, in
                 servicing all active  entries  in  the  service  running
                 list-  equals  or  exceeds  the time specified as t, the
                 next polling cycle begins immediately.  If, on the other
                 hand,  the  time expended in a complete polling cycle is
                 less that t, the beginning of the next polling cycle  is
                 deferred   until   t  seconds  have  elapsed  since  the
                 beginning of  the  cycle  just  completed.   During  the
                 pause,  the  SDLC  link  is  in  "POLL-WAIT" state;  any
                 outgoing  data  ready  for  transmission  to  the   SDLC
                 terminal stations on the link is sent during this pause.
QLLC/SDLC Interface SYSGEN Reference Manual                       Page 30


                 Allowing a pause to elapse when activity on the link  is
                 relatively  low can reduce the amount of processing time
                 consumed by unproductive polling.

                 't' may be from 0 to 25.

                 This statement is only applicable to  the  primary  SDLC
                 GROUP/LINE.

        Default:  If this statement is omitted, the default pause is  one
                 second.


        2.5.25 DHOST               _____

        Syntax:  DHOST(host #)
                 where host # = destination host number of circuit 

        Description:  This statement is required  for  PVC  incoming  and
                 outgoing  lines, and SVC outgoing lines.  For PVC or SVC
                 outgoing circuits this macro defines the target host  #.
                 For  PVC incoming circuits this macro defines the source
                 host #.  The target host #  must  be  an  assigned  SDLC
                 host.

        Default:  If the host # is not defined for the logon of a network
                 procedure, the target host will be the user's home host,
                 if the 'home host' option has  been  selected  when  the
                 user name was validated.


        2.5.26 PVCLINE               _______

        Syntax:  PVCLINE

        Description:  This statement defines all lines in this  group  as
                 Permanent  Virtual  Circuits (PVCs), when defined on the
                 Group level.  When defined on the Line Level, just  this
                 line  is  defined  as  a PVC.  This statement may not be
                 used on the PU level.

        Default:  If this statement or  the  SVCLINE  statement  are  not
                 defined for a line in the Group or Line levels, the line
                 defaults to a PVC.


        2.5.27 SVCLINE               _______

        Syntax:  SVCLINE(arg)

                 where arg = INLNE (for incoming calls)  or  OUTLNE  (for
                 outgoing calls)

        Description:  This statement defines lines  as  Switched  Virtual
                 Call  (SVCs),  and  whether they are incoming (INLNE) or
QLLC/SDLC Interface SYSGEN Reference Manual                       Page 31


                 outgoing (OUTLNE).  An incoming line waits for a Needle,
                 wher  as an outgoing line initiates the SVC by sending a
                 Pseudo-Needle  Request.   This  statement  may  only  be
                 defined on the Group or Line levels.

        Default:  If this statement and the  PVCLINE  statement  are  not
                 defined on the Group or Line levels for a line, then the
                 default is PVC.


        2.5.28 LGN.USER               ________

        Syntax:  LGN.USER(string)
                 where string = string of characters

        Description:  This statement is required for PVC or SVC  outgoing
                 lines only.  This statement may be defined on the Group,
                 Line or PU levels.  It specifies the user's name for the
                 building  of the SVC or PVC to the destination QLLC/SDLC
                 or X.25 ITF.  The user's name must  be  valided  by  the
                 network validation program.

        Default:  There is no default  for  the  user's  name.   If  this
                 statement  is  omitted  in  GROUP level, then it must be
                 define either in LINE or PU level.


        2.5.29 LGN.PASSWORD               ____________

        Syntax:  LGN.PASSWORD(string)
                 where string = string of characters

        Description:  This statement is required for PVC or SVC  outgoing
                 lines only.  This statement may be defined on the Group,
                 Line or PU levels.  It specifies the necessary  password
                 for  the  building  of  a PVC or SVC within the network.
                 The password must be validated by the network validation
                 program.    Unless   the  validation  of  the  user  has
                 specified that no password is required, the creating  of
                 a  virtual  circuit within the network always requires a
                 password.  For PVC lines, destined for an X.25 ITF,  the
                 password  must  have  shut  override  and be of the null
                 password type.

        Default:   There  is  no  default  for   the   'password'.    The
                 LGN.PASSWORD statement must be included for a PVC or SVC
                 outgoing GROUP/LINE/PU definition, when  the  associated
                 user's name required to have a password.


        2.5.30 LGN.GATEWAY               ___________

        Syntax:  LGN.GATEWAY(string,n)
                 where string = string of  characters  and  n  =  gateway
                 level
QLLC/SDLC Interface SYSGEN Reference Manual                       Page 32


        Description:  This statement  is  only  required  for  a  PVC/SVC
                 outgoing SDLC GROUP/LINE/PU definition which is required
                 to go through network gateways to reach the  destination
                 SDLC/QLLC  or  X.25  Interface  host.   It  provides the
                 necessary logon record for a  gateway  logon,  and  also
                 indicates  when  this  gateway  logon  record  should be
                 utilized.  The gateway  logon  record  has  the  similar
                 format  as that of a regular network logon record except
                 that the <;> after the gateway host should be  coded  as
                 <"BB>.   Here  <BB>  is the ASCII code for the character
                 <;>.

        Default:  There is no default for this statement.   If  logon  on
                 through gateway feature is desired, proper gateway logon
                 record(s) must be provided.


        2.5.31 SVC.CALLED               __________

        Syntax:  SVC.CALLED(address)

                 where address = must be 7 bytes long.  The first 2 bytes
                 are  the  destination  DNIC,  the  next  3 bytes are the
                 destination Host #, the next  byte  is  the  destination
                 Line/Link  #,  and  the  last  byte  is  the destination
                 station address.

        Description:  This statement defines the destination address  for
                 SVC  outoing  lines.   This is the address which will be
                 included in the Called Address ISIS message sent to  the
                 destination  interface.  If the destination interface is
                 an X.25  ITF,  then  the  address  is  included  in  the
                 Incoming Call Packet sent to the DTE.

                 This address may identify a  pool  of  destination  SVCs
                 with   the   same   host  number.   In  this  case,  the
                 destination line # and station  address  should  be  all
                 zeroes.

        Default:  There is no default for this statement.  If  the  macro
                 is  undefined  for an SVC outgoing station on either the
                 Group, Line or PU levels, then an  assembly  time  error
                 will be displayed.


        2.5.32 SVC.CGROUP               __________

        Syntax:  SVC.CGROUP(n)
                 where n = interlock code which must be 8 decimal  digits
                 (4  bytes),  the  first 2 bytes are the DNIC, the last 2
                 bytes are any 4 hexadecimal digits.  The X.25  Interface
                 defines the last 2 bytes in BCD.

                 For example, the following interlock codes match:
QLLC/SDLC Interface SYSGEN Reference Manual                       Page 33


                 SDLC/QLLC ITF defines - SVC.CGROUP(31060929)
                 X.25 ITF defines - CUGROUP(1,3106,2345)

        Description:  This statement defines a valid interlock code  used
                 for  Closed User Group Facility.  This statement is only
                 valid for SVC lines and must be  defined  on  the  Group
                 level  only.   More than one SVC.CGROUP statement may be
                 used for the same group.  For outgoing SVCs with  Closed
                 User  Group  (CUG)  facility  subscribed  to,  the first
                 interlock code is included in the Facilities IIX message
                 sent  to  the destination Interface.  For incoming SVCs,
                 the  interlock  code  received  in  the  Facilities  IIX
                 message  must  be  defined as one of the SVC.CGROUPs for
                 this Group.

        Default:  none


        2.5.33 SVC.CUG               _______

        Syntax:  SVC.CUG(arg1,arg2,arg3)

                 where  arg1  =  Yes   (for   subsciber)   or   No   (for
                 nonsubscriber),  arg2  =  INC  (for  incoming access) or
                 blank (for no incoming access), arg3 = OUT (for outgoing
                 access) or blank (for no outgoing access).

        Example:  SVC.CUG(YES,INC,OUT) -  subscriber  with  incoming  and
                 outgoing access.

                 SVC.CUG(YES,,OUT)  -  subscriber  with   just   outgoing
                 access.

                 SVC.CUG(YES,INC,,)  -  subscriber  with  just   incoming
                 access.

                 SVC.CUG(YES,,,)  -  subscriber   without   incoming   or
                 outgoing access.

                 SVC.CUG(NO) - non subscriber

        Description:  This statement is used to define an SVC line  as  a
                 subscriber  or  non  subscriber to the Closed User Group
                 (CUG) Facility,  and  whether  it  has  incoming  and/or
                 outgoing  access.  This statement may only be defined on
                 the Group or Line levels.  If the statement defines  the
                 line(s)  as a CUG subscriber(s) then the valid CUG codes
                 are as defined by the SVC.CGROUP statement in the  Group
                 level.

        Default:  If this statement is not defined  the  default  is  non
                 subscriber  of  the  CUG facility, even if SVC.CGROUP is
                 defined.

        2.5.34 SVC.TCLASS               __________

        Syntax:  SVC.TCLASS(t,r)

                 where t  and  r  =  the  default  transmit  and  receive
                 throughput (TPUT) class respectively.  Both values are 2
                 decimal digits ranging from 03 to 12.  03 = 75 baud,  04
                 =  150  baud,  05  =  300 baud, 06 = 600 baud, 07 = 1200
                 baud, 08 = 2400 baud, 09 = 4800 baud, 10 = 9600 baud, 11
                 = 19200 baud, and 12 = 48000 baud.

        Description:  This statement defines the default Throughput Class
                 Negotiation  values to be used during negotiation.  This
                 statement is only used for SVC lines, and  can  only  be
                 defined  on  the  Group  or  Line  levels.  The X.25 ITF
                 always uses TPUT negotiation, whether it is  defined  in
                 TYMFILE  or  not.   Terefore the QLLC/SDLC ITF will also
                 always use this facility.

        Default:  If this statement is not defined for the Group or Line,
                 then  the  default  for  the line is a subscriber to the
                 throughput class negotiation facility, and  the  default
                 receive  and  transmit  classes  are  equal to the speed
                 (defined in SPEED macro).

        Syntax:  SVC.CHARGE(n)

                 where n = 01 for request reverse charge accepted, 02 for
                 reverse  charge  NOT  requested accepted, or 03 for both
                 reverse charge requested or NOT requested accepted.

        Description:   This  statement  defines  this  SVC  line   as   a
                 subscriber  to  the  Reverse  Charge  Facility, and also
                 defines the  acceptance  status  for  a  reverse  charge
                 request or reverse charge not requested.  This statement
                 may only be defined on the Group or  Line  levels.   For
                 SVC outgoing lines with Both defined (03) reverse charge
                 requested is included in the Facilities IIX message sent
                 to the destination interface.

        Default:  If this statement is not defined for an SVC  line,  the
                 line  defaults to a non subscriber to the Reverse Charge
                 Facility.


        2.5.36 ISTATUS               _______

        Syntax:  ISTATUS(arg)
                 where arg = ACTIVE or INACTIVE

QLLC/SDLC Interface SYSGEN Reference Manual                       Page 35


                 this SDLC interface is initially loaded into the ENGINE.
                 An  inactive station or line could be activated later by
                 the SDLC Interface monitor.

        Default:  This statement may be  omitted,  then  the  default  is
                 active.


        2.5.37 DSIOTP               ______

        SYNTAX:  DSIOTP(arg)
                 where arg = D.TYP0 or D.TYP1

        DESCRIPTION:  THIS STATEMENT SPECIFIES THE VERSION  TYPE  OF  SIO
                 DAUGHTER  BOARD  WHICH  IS INSTALLED IN THE ENGINE.  NEW
                 VERSIONS HAVE SWTICH  DCD  AND  CTS  EIA  SIGNALS.   THE
                 PARAMETER  D.TYP0  IS  DEFINED  TO BE THE DAUGHTER BOARD
                 VERSION G OR  EARLIER,  D.TYP1  IS  DEFINED  TO  BE  THE
                 VERSION H OR LATTER.

        DEFAULT:  IF THIS STATEMENT IS OMITTED, THE DEFAULT SIO  DAUGHTER
                 BOARD VERSION IS D.TYP0.


        2.5.38 QXID               ____

        Syntax:  QXID(string)

                 where string = QXID response  information  field.   This
                 string may be no longer than 80 hex bytes.

        Description:  This statement may  only  be  defined  for  Primary
                 lines.   When  a  QXID is received from the newtork, the
                 received QXID Command is discarded and a  QXID  response
                 using  an information field defined by this statement is
                 sent accross the network.

        Default:  If this statement is not defined then the received QXID
                 command  is  always  sent  as  an  XID  to the secondary
                 station.

        2.5.39 RNRSK1               ______

        Syntax:  RNRSK1(arg)

                 Where arg = YES or NO.

        Description:  There are two schemes used by the SDLC interface to
                 check  if  SDLC interface is ready to receive SDLC frame
                 from external stations.  If 'YES' is defined,  then  the
                 value of receive bufferlet quotas defined by RCVFRMQA is
                 compared  to  the  value  of  window  size  defined   by
                 WINDOWSIZE.   If  'NO'  is  defined,  the  the  value of
                 receive bufferlet quotas defined by RCVFRMQA is compared
                 to the value of 1/2 window size defined by WINDOWSIZE.

        Default:  'NO' scheme  is  always  used  if  this  macro  is  not
                 defined.

        SECTION 2.6 LINE STATEMENTS        _______ ___ ____ __________


        This section describes all the statements belonging to  the  same
        category,  which  is  the second category in the macro hierarchy,
        named LINE.

        The characteristics which are specified again in  this  level  of
        macro  hierarchy  may override the same characteristics which may
        have been defined by an item-macro under GROUP level.


        2.6.1 LINE              ____

        Syntax:  LINE(n)
                 where n = line #

        Description:  This statement specifies a link  with  its  logical
                 line  (SIO  logical  unit) number be set to line#.  This
                 statement also  denotes  the  begining  of  a  group  of
                 characteristics  which  may be applied to the next level
                 PU macros.

        Default:  There is no default for this statement.   For  each  of
                 the  SIO  channels (i.e.  lines), there must be one LINE
                 statement associated with it.


        2.6.2 HOST               ____

        Syntax:  HOST(host#)

        Description:  This statement specifies the SDLC host #  for  this
                 link   when   this   is   an   SVC   incoming   or   PVC
                 incoming/outgoing line.  For a SVC  outgoing  line  this
                 statement is not required.

        Default:  This statement can not be omitted, unless it  has  been
                 defined in the upper level - GROUP level.


        2.6.3 DHOST              _____

        Syntax:  DHOST(host #)

                 see DHOST statement in Group section for details


        2.6.4 SPEED              _____

        Syntax:  SPEED(n)
                 where n = 2400, 4800, 9600, 8000, 19.2k, 56k

        Description:  This statement specifies the transmission speed  of
                 this  line.  Please see SPEED statement in Group section
QLLC/SDLC Interface SYSGEN Reference Manual                       Page 41


                 for more information.

        Default:  If this statement is omitted, and is not defined in the
                 upper GROUP level, then the default line speed is 8000d.

        2.6.15 SNRMRETRIES               ___________

        Syntax:  SNRMRETRIES(m,t,n)
                 where m = number, t = time in 1/10 seconds, n = number

        Description:  This statement specifies the number of SNRM retries
                 with two different aspect for TIF or HIF.

                 As to the TIF side, SNRMRETRIES specifies the number  of
                 SNRMs  sent  to CU from TIF.  Whenever TIF receives SNRM
                 from TIF, it transmits the SNRM  to  CU,  sets  the  1st
                 argument  of  SNRMRETRIES as SNRM retry counter.  If the
                 UA does not  returned  from  from  CU,  then  TIF  sends
                 another  SNRM  when  the PAU.LN times out.  When the 1st
                 argument of SNRM retry reaches 0, TIF checks if the  2nd
                 argument  which is the SNRM pause timer is 0 or not.  If
                 2nd argument is set to 0, then the retry  activities  is
                 stoped  (Since  the  2nd  argument  t  is  0,  the third
                 argument n which is the retry sequence must be 0;   that
                 means,  only the retries specified in the 1st argument m
                 is attempts).  This macro is used in the line level, the
                 default value for the TIF is (1,0,0) that means only one
                 retry is attempted.

                 If n is omitted and t is not 0, then n = 0;  that  means
                 ,  the  retries  specified  in  the  1st  argument  m is
                 attempted.

                 If n is omitted and t is 0, n = 0 is assumed.

                 As to the HIF side, SNRMRETRIES specifies the number  of
                 SNRM  ignored  by  HIF in between the SNRMs sent accross
                 the network.  Whenever HIF gets the SNRMs from fron  end
QLLC/SDLC Interface SYSGEN Reference Manual                       Page 44


                 processor and the SNRMSK is not set, HIF sets the SNRMSK
                 during  the  retry  condition  and  decrements  the  1st
                 argument  m.   When the 1st argument m reaches 0, SNRMSK
                 is cleared and HIF will be able  to  receive  SNRM  from
                 front  end  processor again.  The interval timer between
                 each SNRM ignored by HIF is TNR.LN.  For the  reason  of
                 complexity  of HIF code, the 2nd t and 3rd argument n is
                 always set to 0 without choices.  The default  valu  for
                 HIF  is (5,0,0), and this macro is specified in the line
                 level.

                 The t and n of HIF should always set to 0 without  other
                 choices.

        Default:  If this statement is omitted, the  assumed  value  will
                 (1,0,0) for TIF, (5,0,0) for HIF.


        2.6.16 RCVTORETRIES               ____________

        Syntax:  RCVTORETRIES(m)
                 where m = number of retries while receive timout occurs

        Description:  This statement specifies the number of  retries  of
                 either  RR/RNR  depends  on  the  busy condition of TIF.
                 When a receive timeout occured to  TIF,  TIF  decrements
                 TOTRLN  counter  and  sends  RR/RNR  to  CU.   If TOTRLN
                 reaches 0, TIF enters into HPINOP and sends DM  to  HIF,
                 then enters into HPNDM.  This macro is generated in line
                 level, and is used in TIF only.  The  default  value  of
                 this retry counter is 12.

                 Default:  If this  statement  is  omitted,  the  assumed
                 value will be m=12.


        2.6.17 DISCRETRIES               ___________

        Syntax:  DISCRETRIES(m)
                 where m = number

        Description:  This DISCRETRIES counts the number of DISC sent  to
                 CU,  while  waiting to enter into NDM.  Whenever network
                 circuit is down, TIF sends  DISC  to  CU  several  times
                 until  the  contents  in  SCBDIS  reaches  0.  The retry
                 counter of DISC is DISRLN, and used by TIF  only.   This
                 macro  is  used in line level, and the default number is
                 4.

        Default:  If this statement is omitted, the assumed value will be
                 m=4.

        Syntax:  XIDRETRIES(m)
                 where m = number

        Description:  The XIDRETRIES macro is used  by  HIF  only.   This
                 retry  counter  counts  the  number of XIDs ignored from
                 host in between XIDs sent accross the network.  Whenever
                 HIF  gets  XID  from  front  end  processor, it sets the
                 XIDRLN into SCBXRD (SCBLKS).  HIF ignores the number  of
                 XIDs  during  the  XIDMSK on situation.  When this retry
                 counter reaches 0, XIDMSK is  cleared.   This  macro  is
                 specified  in  line level for HIF use only.  The default
                 value is 5.

        Default:  If this statement is omitted, the assumed value will be

        Description:  The TESTRETRIES macro is used by  HIF  only.   This
                 retry  counter  counts  the number of TESTs ignored from
                 host  in  between  TESTs  sent  accross   the   network.
                 Whenever HIF gets XIDs from front end processor, it sets
                 the TESTLN into SSTRTN (SCBLKS).  HIF ignores the number
                 of  TESTs  during  the  TSTMSK  on situation.  When this
                 retry counter reaches 0, TSTMSK is cleared.  This  macro
                 is  specified  in  line  level  for  HIF  use only.  The
                 default value is 5.

        Default:  If this statement is omitted, the assumed value will be

                 2.6.20 RNRXMTRETRIES                        _____________

                 Syntax:  RNRXMTRETRIES(t)
                 where t = timer (minutes)

        Description:  The RNRXMTRETRIES macro is used by TIF only.   This
                 retry timer specifies how many minutes that the TIF will
                 send RNR to CU, and is not able to get out  of  the  RNR
                 transmit  loop  due to network congestion.  If the timer
                 specified in this RNRXLN expires, TIF gives up trying by
                 entering into HPBUSY, then NDM.

                 If m = 0FF minutes, the infinitive RNR transmit retry is
                 attempts.   The  default  value  of  this  RNR  transmit
                 retries is 10 minutes before going into NDM.  This macro
                 is defined in the line level, and is used by TIF only.

        Default:  If this statement is omitted, the assumed value will be

        Description:  The RNRRCVRETRIES macro is used for TIF only.  This
                 retry timer specifies how many minutes that the TIF will
                 receive consecutive RNR from CU, and is not able to  get
                 out  of  the  RNR receive loop due to the station's busy
                 condition or problem.  If the timer  specified  in  this
                 RRNRLN  expires, TIF gives up trying by entering HPBUSY,
                 then NDM.

                 If m = 0FF minutes, the inifinitive RNR receive retry is
                 attempt.   The default value of this RNR receive retries
                 is 10 minutes before going  into  NDM.   This  macro  is
                 defined in the line level, and is used by TIF only.

        Description:  This statement is only defined for PVC  lines,  and
                 only  on  the  Line or PU levels.  The statement must be
                 defined for both PVC builders  (high  host   )  and  PVC
                 receivers  (low  host  ).  The purpose of this statement
                 is to define the recive throughput class  for  this  PVC
                 station.   This  value  MUST  match  the remote transmit
                 throughput class, or the PVC will be rejected.

        Default:  speed defined by SPEED statement


        2.6.30 PVC.TTPUT               _________

        Syntax:  PVC.TTPUT(t)

                 where t = decimal value  transmit  throughput  class,  n
                 must  have  same  values as the receive throughput class
                 statement (see PVC.RTPUT)

        Description:  This statement must be defined for each  PVC  line,
                 and  can only be defined on the Line or PU levels.  This
                 statement must be defined for both  PVC  builders  (high
                 host  #)  and PVC receivers (low host #).  The value for
                 this transmit throughput class  MUST  be  equal  to  the
                 destination's  receive  throughput  class,  or  the  PVC
                 request will be rejected.

                 For outgoing PVC`s, this value  is  used  to  gouge  the
                 circuit.

        Default:  speed as defined by SPEED statement

        SECTION 2.7 PU STATEMENTS        _______ ___ __ __________


        This section describes all the statements defined under the level
        of  PU, which is the bottom level in the SDLC configuration macro
        hierarchy.  characteristics defined in this level  will  override
        what has been defined in upper levels.


        2.7.1 PU              __

        Syntax:  PU(n)

                 where n = PU #

        Description:  This statement denotes the begining of a  group  of
                 characteristics  which  may  be  specified  for  an SDLC
                 station.  For each SDLC station , there must be  one  PU
                 statement associated with it.

        Default:  No default.


        2.7.2 DHOST              _____

                 Syntax:  DHOST(host  )

        Description:  see DHOST statement in Group section 2.5


        2.7.3 ADDR              ____

        Syntax:  ADDR(addr)
                 where addr = one byte of HEXADECIMAL number                                          ___________

        Description:  This statement specifies the  polling  address  for
                 the  associated  SDLC station.  The polling address must
                 be coded in hexadecimal value.   For  examples,  if  the
                 polling  address  is  '40'  in hexadecimal the statement
                 should be ADDR(40), and if the polling address  is  'C1'
                 in   hexadecimal  the  statement  should  be  ADDR(0C1).
                 Please pay attention to the leading  zero  in  the  last
                 example.  The address must be unique within a link.

        Default:  There is no default value for a polling address.


        2.7.4 MAPADDR              _______

        Syntax:  MAPADDR(addr)
                 where addr = number in HEXADECIMAL value                                        ___________

        Description:  Since the  SDLC  interface  supports  'Split  Line'
                 feature, a terminal (primary) link's polling address may
                 be internally connected through  virtual  circuit  to  a
QLLC/SDLC Interface SYSGEN Reference Manual                       Page 55


                 host  (secondary) link with a different polling address.
                 Therefore,  for  each  terminal  (primary)  link's  SDLC
                 station,  a  mapping  polling address must be specified.
                 This address must be coded with the desired  destination
                 link's polling address.  This statement is only required
                 for a primary SDLC station.

                 The mapping address is included in QLLC  responses  sent
                 accross  the  newtork  to  the destination X./25 or SDLC
                 Interface.

        Default:  No default.


        2.7.5 LGN.USER              ________

        Syntax:  LGN.USER(string)
                 where string = string of characters

        Description:  This statement is only required for an outgoing  PU
                 (SDLC  station).   It  is  needed  during  the permanent
                 circuit building (PVC) or Switched  Virtual  Call  (SVC)
                 stage.  The user's name must be validated by the network
                 validation program.  When the user name is being used to
                 build a PVC to an X.25 ITF, the user name must have shut
                 override capability and have a null password.

        Default:  No default.


        2.7.6 LGN.PASSWORD              ____________

        Syntax:  LGN.PASSWORD(string)
                 where string = string of characters

        Description:  This statement is only  required  for  an  outgoing
                 SDLC   PU  (station).   A  password  associated  with  a
                 particular user's  name  must  be  provided  during  the
                 creation  of  a  permanent  virtual  circuit, unless the
                 user's name is validated with 'no password' option.

        Default:  No default.  This statement my be  omitted  when  meets
                 the condition mentioned above.


        2.7.7 LGN.GATEWAY              ___________

        Syntax:  LGN.GATEWAY(string,n)
                 where string = string of  characters  and  n  =  gateway
                 level

        Description:  This statement is only  required  for  an  outgoing
                 circuit  building SDLC GROUP/LINE/PU definition which is
                 required to go through network  gateways  to  reach  the
                 destination   SDLC  Interface  host.   It  provides  the
QLLC/SDLC Interface SYSGEN Reference Manual                       Page 56


                 necessary logon record for a  gateway  logon,  and  also
                 indicates  when  this  gateway  logon  record  should be
                 utilized.  The gateway  logon  record  has  the  similar
                 format  as that of a regular network logon record except
                 that the <;> after the gateway host should be  coded  as
                 <"BB>.   Here  <BB>  is the ASCII code for the character
                 <;>.

        Default:  There is no default for this statement.   If  logon  on
                 through gateway feature is desired, proper gateway logon
                 record(s) must be provided.


        2.7.8 PVC.DCHAN              _________

        Syntax:  PVC.DCHAN(n)

                 where n = destination  channel  number  in  hexadecimal,
                 value  limits  are  greater than or equal to zero or les
                 than or equal to FF

        Description:  This statement is only defined  for  PVC  stations.
                 The  purpose  of  this  statement is to specify the PVCs
                 destination channel #.  If the destination  is  an  X.25
                 ITF, then this is the channel # being used by the remote
                 DTE.  If the destination is a  QLLC/SDLC  ITF  then  the
                 value  of  n  will  be the polling station address being
                 used by the remote station.

                 This statement is similar to the DCHAN arguement for the
                 PVCHANNEL statement in the X.25 ITF.

                 This statement is required for each PVC  whether  it  is
                 the circuit receiver (has low host #) or circuit builder
                 (has high host #).

        Default:  no default


        2.7.9 PVC.DLINK              _________

        Syntax:  PVC.DLINK(n)

                 where  n  =  destiantion  link  #  in  hexadecimal,   if
                 destination  is  X.25  ITF then n must be between -1 and
                 33, if destination is SDLC ITF then n must be between -1
                 and 17.

        Description:  This statement is only defined  for  PVC  stations.
                 The   purpose  of  this  statement  is  to  specify  the
                 destination link.  If the destination is  an  X.25  ITF,
                 then  n  is the link # being used by the remote DTE.  If
                 the destination is an SDLC ITF, then the value of  n  is
                 the  Line # being used by the remote SDLC station.  This
                 statement must be defined for both  PVC  builders  (high
QLLC/SDLC Interface SYSGEN Reference Manual                       Page 57


                 host #), and PVC receivers (low host #).

        Default:  none


        2.7.10 PVC.RTPUT               _________


                 Syntax:  RTPUT(r)

                 see SVC.CALLED statement in Group section 2.5  for  more
                 details


        2.7.13 ISTATUS               _______

        Syntax:  ISTATUS(arg)
                 where string = ACTIVE or INACTIVE

        Description:  This statement specifies whether the station(s)  in
                 this  GROUP/LINE/PU  should  be  active or inactive when
                 this SDLC interface is initially loaded into the ENGINE.
                 An  inactive station or line could be activated later by
                 the SDLC Interface monitor.

        Default:  This statement may be  omitted,  then  the  default  is
                 active.

        SECTION 3.0 SAMPLE SYSTEM GENERATION FILES        _______ ___ ______ ______ __________ _____


        SECTION 3.1 Introduction to Timer        _______ ___ ____________ __ _____


        The following timer can be specified during the sysgen time:

        NETREPLYTO(t) - Network Reply Timeout (TNR.LN)

        This timer NETREPLYTO macro is defined as  TNR.LN,  whenever  HIF
        (used  for  secondary  port  only)  received  a SNRM (XID, TEST).
        Protocol handler keeps on scanning the UA  (XID,  TEST)  response
        within  the TNR.LN from TIF (network).  If TNR.LN times out, then
        SNRMRETRIES(n,t,m), XIDRETRIES(n), or TESTRETRIES(n)  is  applied
        as  the retry counter for receiving another SNRM (XID, TEST) from
        external secondary stations.  Since TNR.LN is the  timer  defined
        in  HIF  between receiving SNRM and transmitting UA, the value of
        TNR.LN -NETREPLYTO(t)  should  be  less  than  or  equal  to  the
        external primary station's polling interval.


        POLLTIMER(t) - TPD.LN

        This timer TPD.LN is used when RR or RNR is being received by TIF
        (used  for  primary  port only).  SDLC protocol handler waits for
        TPD.LN time before transmitting RR (if not busy), RNR (if  busy),
        or  I-frame  (if  I-frames  are available for transmission).  The
        default value for TPD.LN of multi-point configuration  is  0,  of
        point-to-point  configuration is 2 (1/5 sec).  If TPD.LN does not
        time out, then the foreground dismiss is required.


        TXR.LN - SIO Transmission Timer

        This timer TXR.LN is stored in XTIME, whenever the  SIO  transmit
        module   is  scheduled  by  SXMT.   To  make  sure  a  successful
        transmission,  TXR.LN  should  be  calculated  depending  on  the
        factors  as:   window  size,  Maximum frame size, and line speed.
        TXR.LN is calculated by the formula as:

        SECTION 3.2 Introduction to Retry Counter and Timer        _______ ___ ____________ __ _____ _______ ___ _____


        SNRMRETRIES(n,t,m) - SNRM retry counter (SNRMLN)

        This retry counter SNRMLN is used by  both  TIF,  and  HIF.   The
        SNRMLN  of HIF is to count how many SNRMs are ignored by the HIF,
QLLC/SDLC Interface SYSGEN Reference Manual                       Page 60


        the second and third arguments t, and m are set to 0 always.  The
        SNRMLN  of  TIF is to count how many SNRMs are transmitted to the
        external secondary station by TIF.

        For one-to-one SNRMs transmission, both TIF and  HIF  should  set
        SNRMRETRIES(1,0,0).


        XIDRETRIES(n) - XID retry counter (XIDRLN)

        This retry counter XIDRLN is used by HIF (secondary  port  only).
        The  XIDRLN  ignores  the  number  of XIDs from host specified in
        argument n.  If an one-to-one XID transmission between  host  and
        HIF is required, then specifies XIDRETRIES(1).


        TESTRETRIES(n) - TEST retry counter (TESTLN)

        This retry counter TESTLN is used by HIF (secondary  port  only).
        The  TESTLN  ignores  the  number of TESTs from host specified in
        argument n.  If an one-to-one TEST transmission between host  and
        HIF is required, then specifies TESTRETRIES(1).


        DISCRETRIES(n) - DISC retry counter (DISRLN)

        This retry counter DISRLN is used by  TIF  (primary  port  only).
        The  DISRLN  counts  the number of DISC sent from TIF to external
        secondary station.  If UA or DM is not  received  while  DISC  is
        sent,  then the retries n is applied n times before entering into
        HPNDM.


        RNRXMTRETRIES(t) - RNR re-transmission timer (RNRXLN)

        This timer is used to take error recovery actions while TIF (used
        for  prrimary  port  only)  keeps  transmitting  RNR  to external
        secondary stations.  The retry timer specifies how  many  minutes
        are  allowed  the  TIF to transmit RNR to controller.  If t times
        out,  then  TIF  enters  into  HPNDM,  otherwise;   if  the  busy
        condition of TIF disappears, and RR is transmit instead, then TIF
        stays in normal operational mode.


        RNRRCVRETRIES(t) - RNR receive retry timer (RRNRLN)

        This timer is used to take error recovery actions while  the  TIF
        (used  for  primary  port only) keeps receiving RNR from external
        secondary stations.  The retry timer t allowes TIF to receive RNR
        from  controller  for t minutes.  If t times out, then TIF enters
        into HPNDM.  If RR is received within the retry timer t, then TIF
        stays in the normal operational mode.


        RCVTORETRIES(n) - Receive Timeout Retry Counter (TOTRLN)
QLLC/SDLC Interface SYSGEN Reference Manual                       Page 61


        This retry counter is to take error recovery  actions  while  the
        TIF (used for primary port only) gets receive timeout.  TIF tries
        to send  RR,  or  RNR  (if  busy)  to  controller  several  timer
        specified  in  RCVTORETRIES.   When all the retry counts are used
        up, but TIF still gets receiving timeout, then  TIF  enters  into
        HPNDM.   If  retries several times after the receive timeout, and
        receive timout situation disappears, then  TIF  stays  in  normal
        operational mode.
