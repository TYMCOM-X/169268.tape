        Introduction        ____________


        The UOM (UTS4000 Operations Monitor) is a  tool  to  monitor  and
        control operation of the UTS terminal and host interfaces.

        The UOM is currently accessed through the ?STAT command  in  DDT.
        When  in the UOM, the prompt (:>) indicates that the UOM is ready
        to accept commands.

        Command lines are terminated by a carriage return.  Arguments are
        separated by either a comma, space, line feed, or tab.

        There is limited editing control for the UOM.  An  ESCAPE  aborts
        the  current  command  line  and  returns  to the prompt (:>).  A
        control W (^W) discards the partial token already  input,  either
        word  or number.  A control A (^A) and control H (^H) discard the
        last character of the token, effectively a backspace.

        A control C (^C) can be entered at  any  time  to  terminate  the
        current  process  of  the  UOM  (i.e., halt output).  The user is
        returned from the UOM to DDT.

        The date is displayed in the form ddmmmyy;  where dd is the  day,
        mmm is the month, and yy is the year (e.g., 10JUL85).

        When the UOM specification refers to the relative poll group,  or
        station  address,  it  refers to the order in which each of these
        was defined in the  interface  Tymfile.   The  first  poll  group
        defined is poll group 0, the second is poll group 1, etc.

        2.  Line, Poll Group and Station Functions        __  _____ ____ _____ ___ _______ _________


        The  second   section   of   the   UTS4000   Operations   Monitor
        Specification consists of commands that provide information about
        the current  status  of  the  lines,  poll  groups  and  stations
        connected  to  the slot and provide a means to exert control over
        them.

        2.1.  Mode Command        ____  ____ _______

        Syntax:  MODE aaa

        Default:  ADR

        The MODE command sets  the  selection  mode,  where  aaa  is  the
        desired mode.  This determines whether in the applicable commands
        the poll groups and stations are specified by  relative  position
        number  or  address.  The default mode is ASCII.  Modes cannot be
        mixed within a single command line.  The modes are  specified  as
        follows:

        REL
                Relative position number.
        ASCII
                Address in ASCII (RID or SID).
        HEX
                Address in hexadecimal (RID or SID).
        OCTAL
                Address in octal (RID or SID).


        If the MODE command is entered without  specifying  a  mode,  the
        current mode is displayed.

        Most commands requiring a  poll  group  and/or  station  argument
        (ri/si)  operate  in  either mode.  The arguments entered will be
        interpreted according to the current state of MODE.


        2.2.  List Line Command        ____  ____ ____ _______

        Syntax:  LLINE [ln]

        The LLINE command displays the  line  status  for  the  specified
        line,  where ln is the line number.  If no line is specified, the
        command displays the status of all lines.

        Syntax:  LRID ln,[ri]

        The LRID command dibsplays  the  status  of  the  specified  poll
        group,  where ln is the line number and ri is the poll group.  If
        no poll group is specified, the status of all poll groups on  the
        specified line is displayed.

        The LSID command displays the status of  the  specified  station,
        where  ln is the line number, ri is the poll group, and si is the
        station.  If no station is specified, the status of all  stations
        in  the  specified  poll group is displayed.  In the address mode
        the command will be  rejected  if  the  line  and/or  poll  group
        numbers are not entered.

                between terminal interface and UTS type host via UTS host
                interface  (TIF  only).   ASCII  indicates that a circuit
                exists between terminal interface and an ASCII type  host
                (host  that  accepts  ASCII character mode data streams).
                LOCKED indicates that the SID has been  locked  out  (HIF
                only) and will not be accesible until reset via the RESET
                command (see 2.14).

        2.5.  List Device Command        ____  ____ ______ _______

        Syntax:  LDID ln,[ri],[si]

        The LDID command displays the last known status of all devices in
        a  SID  where ln is the line number, ri is the poll group, and si
        is the station.  If no station is specified, the  status  of  all
        stations  in  the  specified poll group is displayed.  If no poll
        group is specified, the status of allpoll groups on the specified
        line is displayed.

        The poll group and station fields will be  interpreted  according
        to the current mode.

        Syntax:  LHIST ln/dr

        The LHIST command displays the current history counts of xmit and
        rcv   operations.    For  the  host  interface  this  history  is
        maintained on  a  per  line  (ln)  basis  and  for  the  terminal
        interface  it  is  maintained  on  a  per  drop (dr) basis.  In a
        multiplexer configuration there may be multiple poll groups at  a
        single physical drop (hence the distinction between drop and poll
        group).

        then a response.

        rsd
                rsd stands for RID SID DID.  If the Transmit  or  Receive
                condition has associated with it a RID SID and DID, these
                are displayed

        The following is a  list  of  all  possible  receive  conditions.
        Conditions  that  appear in CAPS are error conditions detected in

        e-b
                This  column  shows  how  much  time  (in  seconds)   the
                operation consumed.  (end time minus begin time)

        since last
                This column shows how much time has elapsed  between  the
                end  of  the  previous  event  and  the  beginning of the
                current event.


        2.19.  toggle trace no response suppression command        _____  ______ _____ __ ________ ___________ _______

        Syntax:  TRCSUP [0 or 1]

        This command allows the user to suppress the tracing of ntrf  (no
        traffic)  entries in the SCOPE command.  1 causes the suppression
        0 disables the suppression.  If  TRCSUP  is  entered  without  an
        argument, the current state is displayed.

        TrcSup is = 0


        2.20.  Kill Circuits Command.        _____  ____ ________ ________

        Syntax:  KILL ln,ri,si

        The KILL command kills the circuit associated with the  specified
        SID.  For PVCs, automatic re-establishment is prohibited.


        2.21.  Build Circuits Command. (TIF only)        _____  _____ ________ ________

        Syntax:  BUILD ln,ri,si (TIF only)

        The BUILD command allows the  PVC  circuit  associated  with  the
Tymnet UTS4000 Operations Monitor (UOM)                                  Page 16


        specified SID that was killed by the KILL command to be rebuilt.


        2.22.  Reset SID command (HIF only)         _____  _____ ___ _______

        Syntax:  RESET ln,ri,si

        This command unlocks a SID at the host interface.  The SID  state
        may  become  LOCKED  (shown  in  LSID)  when  a prespecified host
        signoff sequence does not complete successfully.  Locking the SID
        ensures that no other user will be able to access that particular
        SID and thus guards against session security violation.
