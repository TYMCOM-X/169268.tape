  necessary  to define  and  generate a  TYMNET SDLC  Interface  to provide
  access between  SDLC protocol terminals  and hosts utilizing  the packet-
  switching transmission facilities of  TYMNET. This manual is  directed to
  network  analysts  and network  programmers  for defining  a  TYMNET SDLC
  Interface.



       Prerequisites  to  use  this manual  are  a  basic  understanding of
  teleprocessing,  a  general knowledge  of  SDLC protocol,  and  a general
  knowledge  of the  purpose of  the TYMNET  SDLC Interface.  These  may be
  obtained from the following documents:

  1 - Overview


       TYMNET  SDLC interfaces  with  primary and  secondary  ports provide
  access between  SDLC protocol terminals  and hosts utilizing  the packet-
  switching data transmission services of TYMNET.


       No hardware or  software changes are  normally required at  the host
  computer.  A secondary port will appear to the host computer as  a single
  secondary station on  a point-to-point link or  as a number  of secondary
  stations on a multipoint link.


       No hardware or software changes are required at the remote terminal.
  A primary port will appear  to attached terminals on a  point-to-point or
  multipoint link as a primary station.


       The TYMNET SDLC interface supports Physical Unit types 1, 2,  and 4,
  and is transparent to all Logical Unit types.


       This document is dividied  into nine sections. The first  2 sections
  are  an  introduction  and   overview  of  the  SDLC   system  generation
  statements.  The middle sections contain detailed information on  each of
  these  statements.  The  system generation  statements  are  grouped into
  sections according to similar functions. The last 2 sections give example
  TYMFILEs, NAD printouts and possible error and warning messages.

  2 - SDLC TYMFILE





       Configuration of an SDLC interface requires a TYMFILE. A  TYMFILE is
  a file which contains all the configuration-related  statements necessary
  for  the generation  of slot  code for  a particular  configuration.  All
  these  configuration-related statements  are represented  by  the System-
  defined macro statements, which are further divided into five categories.
  They are as follows:

            o control-directives
            o network and ISIS statements
            o monitor statements
            o SDLC-station configuration statements
            o SDLC counter/timer statements











     2.1  Hierarchy of SDLC Station Statements



       An  SDLC  interface  may  be  viewed  as  a  logical  arrangement of
  elements, each kind of  element occupying a different  hierarchical level
  within the category of macros called SDLC configuration aggregate-macros.


       The highest  element is the  protocol group, either  a primary  or a
  secondary group.   Each group in  an SDLC interface  is represented  by a
  GROUP aggregate-macro.


       The next element is the  communication line (or link). Each  line in
  an SDLC interface is  represented by a LINE aggregate-macro,  whether the
  line is non-switched multipoint, non-switched point-to-point, or switched
  point-to-point.

  SDLC TYMFILE                                             October 24, 1986


       The last element of the hierarchical levels is the SDLC  station (or
  port). Each SDLC  station is represented  by a PU  aggregate-macro, which
  represents the physical unit within the SDLC station.









     2.2  Item Macros



       To  supply  further  detailed  configuration  information    for  an
  aggregate-macro, several item-macros  are defined. Each  individual item-
  macro clearly specifies a particular characteristic, property or function
  pertinent to an SDLC station, SDLC line, or SDLC group.









     2.3  Advantage of Hierarchy



       The principal  advantage of  macro hierarchy is  that it  provides a
  logical structure. In addition, it saves coding effort. For example, each
  of five characteristics common to all of fifteen SDLC stations on  a link
  can be specified once, in  the LINE aggregate-macro, rather than  in each
  of the fifteen individual PU aggregate-macros.


       The characteristic need not be identical for all of the  elements at
  a level to specify it at  a higher level. You may code the  exceptions at
  the  lower  level;  any  characteristic  you  code  at  the  lower  level
  automatically  overrides  the characteristic  specified  at  the previous
  higher level. If, for example, only ten of the fifteen stations mentioned
  previously  have  the same  characteristics  in common,  you  could still
  specify  that  characteristic in  the  LINE level-macro,  then  you would
  specify the differing characteristics in the PU level-macros for the five
  exceptional stations.

            In the following example, lines 0 and 1 have host # 829
            while line 3 has host # 849.

     2.4  Summary of Macros



       The  following  figure lists  all  of the  item-macros  of  the SDLC
  interface configuration macros for SDLC lines. The asterisk indicates the
  macro under which the statement may be defined.


       This summary does not indicate the conditions (for example,  type of
  line control, type of station)  under which the item is  appropriate, for
  this information,  please see  the individual  macro descriptions  in the
  SDLC-station configuration and counter/timer statements sections.


       Note: This summary does  not include other system  generation macros
  such as PRINT, MONITOR, etc.

  3 - Control Directives




       This section  describes those statements  which primary  function is
  the controlling of the print-out of the configuration  parameter listing.
  A configuration  parameter listing  is the listing  of all  the resulting
  functions  and characteristics  of  an SDLC  interface in  a  summary and
  easily-readable form on the user's ASCII terminal.  Refer to  the section
  on Sample Nad Print-out for more information.


       For the  ENDTYM statement  there is  a list  of messages  which this
  macro may invoke. For more details on these messages refer to the section
  on Error code/Warning messages.

     3.1  PRINT/NOPRINT



         Syntax:  PRINT

         Syntax:  NOPRINT


         Description: The 'PRINT' and 'NOPRINT' control directives turn the
            configuration parameter listing switch on and off respectively.
            The user can insert  these statements any places in  a Tymfile.
            These  statements  have  no  affects  on  the  regular assembly
            listing. Also, they have no affects on the BEGINTYM  and ENDTYM
            statements below.


         Default: If niether of  the these two statements are  coded before
            an SDLC station configuration statement, then the configuration
            parameter   listing  for  that  statement  is  listed   on  the
            terminal.

     3.2  BEGINTYM



         Syntax:  BEGINTYM


         Description: This statement denotes the begining of a Tymfile, and
            prints the  title of the  configuration parameter  listing. The
            version number  and revision level  of this SDLC  interface are
            also part  of a configuration  parameter listing title.  All of
            this information  is  listed whenever  a BEGINTYM  statement is
            coded in an SDLC interface Tymfile.


         Default:  If  this  statement is  omitted,  then  no configuration
            parameter listing  title is printed.   However, it  is strongly
            recommended that this statement  be coded in an  SDLC interface
            Tymfile as the 'FIRST' statement.

     3.3  ENDTYM



         Syntax:  ENDTYM


         Description:  This statement  denotes the  end of  a  Tymfile, and
            triggers  the  checking  procedures  for  a  consistent  system
            configuration for this SDLC interface.  A final section  of the
            configuration  parameter  listing  which  contains  consistency
            checking  messages  will  be  printed,  if  any  in-consistency
            existed in the SDLC interface Tymfile.


         Default:  If  this  statement  is  omitted,  then  the consistency
            checking  procedures are  bypassed. Therefore,  it  is strongly
            recommended that this statement  be coded in an  SDLC interface
            Tymfile as the last statement.

  4 - Network and ISIS Statements




       This section  describes the statements  which primarily  specify the
  internal  constraints and  characteristics of  an SDLC  interface.  These
  internal  constraints and  characteristics are  pertinent to  the network
  technology employed inside the TYMNET or the system rules related  to the
  ISIS  system. ISIS  (Internally Switched  Interface System)  is  a system
  which contains a set of rules  as to how the different interfaces  are to
  be constructed, and how they are to communicate with each other. For more
  detailed information about  ISIS, please see ISIS-II  Internally Switched
  Interface  System  REFERENCE  MANUAL.  The  SDLC  interfaces   are   only
  compatible with  the ISIS-II system.


       In each of the following  descriptions, there is a list  of message.
  These messages  are listed  along with  the cause  of this  message. When
  assembling the SDLC TYMFILE, there may be some messages displayed  on the
  terminal.   For information  on what  actions to  take for  each message,
  refer to the section on Error code/Warning messages.


       These statements  may be defined  on any level  (Group/Line/PU etc),
  but must be after the BEGINTYM and before the ENDTYM statements.  To make
  the TYMFILE readable and easily understood, these macros should be at the
  beginning  of   the  TYMFILE  before   any  SDLC   Station  Configuration
  Statements.

     4.1  FREEZE



         Syntax: FREEZE(arg)


         Argument(s):
                  arg = freeze selection
                    radix: "keyword"
                    range: YES or NO
                    default: NO

         Description: These statements  specify whether the  SDLC interface
            should stop, should  a crash occur.   A 'crash' is  a mechanism
            implemented in the SDLC  interface to trap either  the hardware
            or software  problems. If  FREEZE(yes) is  coded, then  after a
            'crash' occurs the  frozen  SDLC interface code can   be dumped
            into  a disk  file  or directly  'looked' into  by  a qualified
            network analyst or network  developer to analyze and  debug the
            trapped problem.


         Suggested Setting: Unless there is a good reason to  do otherwise,
            this  statement  should  be  set  for  FREEZE(YES).   The  SDLC
            interface only crashes when there is something very  wrong. The
            FREEZE(YES) option will not cause needless crashes.

     4.2  TIMEZONE



         Syntax: TIMEZONE(n)


         Argument(s):
                  n = hours offset from GMT
                  radix: decimal
                  range: -23 =< n =< 23
                  default:    -8 (PST)


         Description:  This  statement specifies  the  necessary correction
            value  which should  be  the time-zone  correction  factor from
            coordinated  universal   time.   For  example,   the  time-zone
            correction value for PACIFIC SAVING TIME is -8d.


         Suggested Setting:  The timezone  should be set  to the  time zone
            where the SDLC interface will be residing.

     4.3  ISISRING



         Syntax: ISISRING(n1,n2)


         Argument(s):
                  n1 = IRSIZE (input ISIS ring size)
                  n2 = ORSIZE (output ISIS ring size)
                    radix:      decimal
                    default:    4092d for n1 and n2

         Description: IRSIZE  and ORSIZE  are the sizes  of input  ring and
            output   ring   for   the   internal   ISIS   dispatcher  logic
            respectively. These  values should be  a multiple of  four. The
            ring size  should be  at least   the total  number of  input or
            output characters that may  be expected to be received  from or
            transmitted to the network in any one second period.

     4.4  BUFSIZE



         Syntax: BUFSIZE(n)


         Argument(s):
                  n = byte size of big bufferlets
                    radix: decimal (must be an even number)
                    range: 8 < n
                    default: 140d


         Description: This statement  defines the buffer size  for internal
            buffers.  The  size of  the buffer should  be selected  to best
            utilize the available memory spaces.

     4.5  PSEUDO.HOST



         Syntax: PSEUDO.HOST(host #)


         Argument(s):
                  host # = TYMNET host #
                  radix: decimal
                  no. digits: 1 thru 5
                  default: none


         Description: This  statement defines the  Host number used  in the
            Pseudo Needle  request ISIS message  sent by a  primary station
            when  building a  circuit. This  statement must  be  defined if
            there are any primary stations defined for the SDLC interface.


         Suggested Setting: Any TYMNET validated host number with 5 or less
            digits would be  fine for this  statement. The host  number for
            the op monitor, MONITOR(host#), and this host number may be the
            same to save host numbers.

     4.6  PVCTIMER



         Syntax: PVCTIMER(t)


         Argument(s):
                  t = time in seconds
                  radix: decimal
                  range: 30d < t
                  default: 60d seconds


         Description: This  statement specifies  the waiting  time required
            before the interface starts to build the circuit again  after a
            circuit  is  cleared  due  to  various  reasons.  Since certain
            internal clean-up procedures are needed to be  performed before
            a new circuit  can be re-built,  the value specified  should be
            greater than 30 seconds. Another use of this macro is  to avoid
            flooding the network supervisor with excessive circuit building
            requests.


         Suggested  Setting: This  value should  not be  set lower  than 30
            seconds, and  usually 60 seconds  (the default)  is sufficient.
            The interface needs a certain  amount of time to reset  all the
            internal control blocks before another circuit building attempt
            can be made.  Message(s):
                  *** WARNING 01 ***  ;If t < 60d seconds

                    radix: "keyword"
                    range: M.TYP0 or M.TYP1
                    default: M.TYP0

         Description:  This  statement specifies  sio  micro  code version.
            Argument M.TYP0 is defined to be the version type D or earlier,
            M.TYP1 is defined to be the version type E or later.


         Suggested Setting: If the version stamped on the SIO  mother board
            SIO  chip is  E or  later then  set this  statement  to M.TYP1,
            otherwise set to M.TYP0. If any of the following conditions are
            true then SIO micro code  version E or later should be  used in
            the engine:
            o If M.TYP1 is defined for MSIOTP and
            o If excessive ending flags should be elliminated or
            o If big frames are to be supported or
            o If the SIO receiving buffer space should be reduced
              (see RCVSIOFR statement)

  5 - Monitor Statements




       This section describes those statements which primary purpose  is to
  define  the  characteristics  of  the  SDLC  monitor  feature.   For more
  information about  the function  and capability  of the  SDLC interface's
  monitoring  features,  please  refer  to  the  SDLC   External  Reference
  Specification.


       Each of the following monitor statement descriptions, have a list of
  messages.  Along with  each message there is  a cause identified.  If the
  identified cause occurs, the Error or Warning message will appear  on the
  terminal screen. For information on the message actions to take  refer to
  the section on Error Codes/ Warning Messages.


       The monitor statements should  be grouped together and be  placed in
  the TYMFILE  before any  SDLC Station  Configuration Statements  for easy
  readability. Each  of the  following monitor  statements must  follow the
  MONITOR(host#) macro.

                  radix: decimal
                  no. digits: 1 thru 5
                  default: none

         Level(s):  Define  after  BEGINTYM  but  before  any  SDLC station
            configuration statements.


         Description: This statement specifies that this SDLC interface has
            the monitor function capability,  and at the same  time defines
            the host #  for the monitor.   All the following  statements in
            this  section  are  meaningful  only  when  this  statement  is
            included.  If the  monitor function is desired,  this statement
            must be included;  otherwise, no monitor function  is supported
            in this interface.


         Suggested Setting: If  anyone will be  using the op  monitor, this
            statement must be defined. It is suggested that the  op monitor
            be selected even if it will not be used.

         Level(s): Define after MONITOR statement.


         Dependancies: The MONITOR statement must be defined.


         Description: This statement specifies the total number  of entries
            in the log table. The log table records the  exceptional events
            occur in the SDLC  Interface after this Interface  is initially
            loaded into the  ENGINE. Each entry in  the table is  10d bytes
            long.  The  data recorded  for an event  include the  time when
            such an event occurs,  the event code, and the  associated line
            and/or station  number.  When  the log table  is full,  the new

  6 - SDLC Station Configuration Statements




       This section  describes the  SDLC station  configuration statements.
  These  statements  are  used to  control  SDLC  protocol  parameters. The
  following statements may  be defined in  a hierarchical manner  (refer to
  the section titled Hierarchy of SDLC Station Statements).


       Each description explains the different level(s) the statement maybe
  defined  under.  Also  included with  each  description  is  the assembly
  message(s) that maybe displayed on the terminal if certain conditions are
  met. For actions  which may be taken  to elliminate the messages  see the
  section titled Error Code/Warning Messages.

     6.1  ADDR



         Syntax: ADDR(addr)


         Argument(s):
                  addr = station address
                    radix: hexadecimal
                    range: 00 < addr < FF
                    default: none


         Level(s): Define on the PU level only.


         Dependancies: Must be unique within a line. For a  secondary line,
            this  address  must  be  the same  as  the  address  defined by
            LGN.MAPADDR at the primary line.


         Description: This statement specifies the polling address  for the
            associated SDLC station. The  polling address must be  coded in
            hexadecimal value. For examples, if the polling address is '40'
            in hexadecimal  the statement  should be  ADDR(40), and  if the
            polling address is 'C1' in hexadecimal the statement  should be
            ADDR(0C1). Please pay attention to the leading zero in the last
            example.  The address must be unique within a link.


         Suggested Setting: Set the address to the address defined for that
            station by the host system  if a secondary port, or set  to the
            address being used by the secondary station.

                    default: HALF


         Level(s): Define on Group or Line levels only. Do not define on PU
            level.


         Dependancies: Full duplex is NOT currently supported.

         Description: This statements specify the data transmission mode is
            either full-duplex  or half-duplex mode.  Here the mode  is the
            mode of data transmission (SDLC protocol) ; it is not  the mode
            of  the transmission  facility.  Currently  the  SDLC interface
            only supports half-duplex mode.


         Suggested  Setting: This  statement  must be  set  to half-duplex.
            Full-duplex is not currently supported.

     6.3  DSIOTP



         SYNTAX: DSIOTP(arg)


         Argument(s):
                  arg = SIO Daughter board version
                    radix: "keyword"
                    range: D.TYP0 or D.TYP1
                    default: D.TYP0


         Level(s): Define on Group or Line levels only. Do not define on PU
            level.


         Description: This  statement defines the  version of  SIO daughter
            board which is installed in the engine. SIO versions later than
            G  have switched  the DCD  and CTS  EIA siganls.  The parameter
            D.TYP0 is defined to be  SIO versions G and earlier.  D.TYP1 is
            defined to be versions H and later.


         Suggested Setting: To find the  SIO version, look at the  SIO card
            itself. The versions should be on the SIO daughter card.

                    radix: decimal
                    range: 2 < n
                    default: 270 bytes (n=270)


         Level(s): Define on Group or Line levels only. Do not define on PU
            level.


         Description: This statement specifies the maximum size in  bytes a
            single frame could be transmitted or received within  the links
            of this group or line.


         Suggested Setting:  Set the framsize  to the maximum  framesize of
            the external system plus 2 decimal bytes. The size should be on
            an even boundary.

         Argument(s):
                   host # = Tymnet host #
                     radix: decimal
                     no. digits: 1 to 5
                     default: none 


         Level(s): Define on the Group or Line levels. Do not define on the
            PU level.


         Dependancies: Define  for secondary  lines or  groups only.  For a
            secondary line this number must be the same as the  host number
            defined by the primary LGN.HOST macro.


         Description:  This  statement  specifies the  SDLC  host  #  for a
            secondary  SDLC line(s).  This host  # is  used  during circuit
            building by  the primary  line(s) to  target (using  logon ISIS
            messages) destination secondary line(s). This same  host number
            must be defined for  the originating primary line(s)  using the
            LGN.HOST  (host  #)   macro.  Because  primary   line(s)   only
            originate ciruits, only secondary line(s) require the HOST(host
            #) statement to be defined.


         Suggested Setting: Set this host # for secondary  line(s) equal to
            the LGN.HOST host # from the originating primary line(s).

     6.7  ISTATUS


         Syntax: ISTATUS(arg)


         Argument(s):
                  arg = initial state of Group/Line/PU
                    radix: "keyword"
                    range: ACTIVE, INACT or INACTIVE
                    default: ACTIVE


         Level(s): Define on a Group, Line or PU level.


         Description: This  statement specifies  whether the  station(s) in
            this GROUP/LINE/PU should be active or inactive when  this SDLC
            interface  is initially  loaded into  the ENGINE.   An inactive
            station or line could be activated later by the  SDLC Interface
            monitor.


         Suggested Setting: If the station will not be used for more than a
            day  or so  it should  be set  to an  INACTIVE state  until the
            station is ready for use.

         Level(s): Define on PU level only.


         Dependancies: Define for  primary stations only. This  number must
            be the same as the destination line # defined in the LINE macro
            at the secondary line.


         Description:  A host  # maybe  associated with  several  SDLC host
            (secondary)  lines;  however,  to  build  a  permanent  virtual
            circuit  it  is  necessary  to  know  which  unique destination
            station this circuit  is going to  connect to. A  unique target
            station is required to  specify its associated host #,  line #,
            and polling address.  This  statement is to specify  the target
            line #.  See the sections  describing LGN.HOST  and LGN.MAPADDR
            for destination host # and polling address.


         Suggested  Setting:  To  set  this  line  number  use  the  target
            secondary  line  number  from LINE(line  #)  statement  in host
            interface.

         Level(s): Define on Group, Line or PU levels.


         Dependancies: For primary groups, lines or stations only.


         Description: This  statement is only  required for a  primary SDLC
            GROUP/LINE/PU  definition  which  is  required  to  go  through
            network gateways to reach the destination SDLC  Interface host.
            It provides the necessary logon record for a gateway logon, and
            also  indicates  when  this  gateway  logon  record  should  be
            utilized.  The gateway logon  record has the similar  format as
            that  of a  regular network  logon record  except that  the <;>
            after the gateway host should  be coded as <"BB>. Here  <BB> is
            the  ASCII code  for  the character  <;>. For  the  first level
            gateway n should be set to 0, for the second level n  should be
            set to 1 and  so on. For an  example see the sample  TYMFILE in
            the section titled Sample TYMFILE.


         Suggested Setting: Use the logon information for the gateway which
            will  be  used. The  usual  format for  this  record  would be:
            username;password:host #.

         Level(s): Define on Group, Line or PU levels.


         Dependancies:  Only required  for primary  stations.  The LGN.HOST
            host  # should  be equal  to the  destination HOST  host number
            defined at the target secondary line.


         Description: This statement  specifies the target host  number for
            the permanent  virtual circuits  originating from  this primary
            station.  The target host # must be an assigned SDLC host. This
            host # must  also be defined  for the target  secondary station
            using the HOST(host#) statement.


         Suggested Setting: Use the destination host # from the  HOST macro
            for this LGN.HOST host #.If  the host # is not defined  for the
            logon  of a  network  procedure, the  target host  will  be the
            user's home host, if  the 'home host' option has  been selected
            when the user name was validated.

     6.11  LGN.MAPADDR



         Syntax: LGN.MAPADDR(addr)


         Argument(s):
                  addr = destination station address
                    radix: hexadecimal
                    range: 0 < addr < FF
                    default: none


         Level(s): Define on PU level only.


         Dependancies: Define  for primary  stations only.  The LGN.MAPADDR
            should be the same as the ADDR at the target secondary line.


         Description:  Since  the  SDLC  interface  supports  'Split  Line'
            feature,  a terminal  (primary) link's  polling address  may be
            internally  connected  through   virtual  circuit  to   a  host
            (secondary) link with a different polling  address.  Therefore,
            for  each terminal  (primary)  link's SDLC  station,  a mapping
            polling address must be  specified. This address must  be coded
            with the desired destination link's polling address.


         Suggested Setting: The LGN.MAPADDR should be equal to the  ADDR of
            the destination secondary station. If the address starts with a
            hexadecimal A,  B, C,  D, E  or F,  put a  zero infront  of the
            address.   That is  a  mappaddress of  C1 would  be  defined as
            LGN.MAPADDR(0C1).

                    radix: ASCII
                    range: TYMNET valid password
                    default: none


         Level(s): Define only on PU level.


         Dependancies:  Define  for  primary  stations  only.  LGN.PASSWORD
            should  be  the  TYMNET  validated  password  for  the LGN.USER
            username being used for circuit building.


         Description: This statement  specifies the necessary  password for
            the  building  of a  virtual  circuit within  the  network. The
            password must be  validated by the network  validation program.
            Unless  the  validation  of  the  user  has  specified  that no
            password is required, the creating of a virtual  circuit within
            the network normally requires a password.


         Suggested Setting: Unless  the username has specified  no password
            required, then  this statement  must be  defined for  a primary
            station.  The  password  would be  the  one  validated  for the
            username  being used  to create  a circuit  to  the destination
            secondary station. See LGN.USER for more information.

            There is no default for  the user's name. If this  statement is
            omitted in GROUP level, then  it must be define either  in LINE
            or PU level.


         Suggested  Setting:  The  sepcified  username  should  be  a valid
            username on the network.

         Level(s):  Define  on the  Group  level, or  define  without using
            groups (one line at a time).


         Description: This statement specifies a link with its logical line
            (SIO logical unit) number be set to  line#. This statement also
            denotes the  begining of  a group of characteristics  which may
            be applied to  the next level PU  macros.  There is  no default
            for this statement.  For each of the SIO channels (i.e. lines),
            there must be one LINE statement associated with it.


         Suggested Setting:  Lines do not  have to be  defined sequencially
            (i.e.  there could be defined LINE(1), then LINE(0)  and lastly
            LINE(2)).   However,  in  one  TYMFILE  if  there  are  5 lines
            defined, then there must be a line(0), (1), (2), (3), and (4).

     6.18  RCVSIOFR



         Syntax: RCVSIOFR(n)


         Argument(s):
                  n = number of SIO receive frames
                      radix: decimal
                      range: 2 < n
                      default: 8 frames (n=8)


         Level(s): Define on Group or Line levels. Do not define on  the PU
            level.


         Dependancies: This statement can  only be used if  SIO motherboard
            versions  E  or later  are  installed in  the  engine,  and the
            statement MSIOTP must be defined for M.TYP1.


         Description: This statement specifies the SIO receive buffer space
            in number  of receive frames.  If this statement  is set  to 2,
            then enough room is reserved in the SIO receive buffer to store
            2 frames with a maximum framesize, see FRAMESIZE macro.


         Suggested Setting: If  the maximum framesize is  less than 4  K or
            the SIO motherboard version  is earlier than E,  this statement
            should not be defined.  The default of 8 will be used  in those
            cases. If the framesize is  larger than 4 K, this  statement is
            used to make sure the  SIO XMT and SIO RCV buffers  together do
            not exceed 64 K. For example:

                  8 SIO RCV frames
                + 8 SIO XMT frames
                --------
                 16 SIO total frames

                  64 K divided by 16 frames = 4 K max. per frame

               If the maximum framesize is > 4 K it is necessary to 
               reduce the number of SIO RCV frames so that 64 K 
               is not exceeded. For example:

                   2 SIO RCV frames   ;define RCVSIOFR(2)
                 + 8 SIO XMT frames
                 ------
                  10 SIO total frames

                   64 K divided by 10 frames = 6.2 K per frame

         Dependances:  The  external  system  must  also   provide  RTS/CTS
            handshaking.


         Description:   This  statement   specifies  whether   the  RTS/CTS
            handshaking sequences should  be performed whenever a  group of
            contiguous frames are  transmitting to external  system. Please
            refer  to RS-232-C  document for  a  description  of  these two
            electrical signals.


         Suggested  Setting:  The  setting for  this  statement  depends on
            whether  the external  signals provide  RTS/CTS  handshaking or
            not.

         Description: This statement specifies the line  transmission speed
            for  this line.  This  value is  used internally  to  gauge the
            circuit  (only gauged  by primary  lines). The  gauge character
            determines the speed of packets on the network.

         Dependancies: External system should privide   DTR/DSR handshaking
            if this statement is set to YES.


         Description:   This   statement   specifies   whether   a  DTR/DSR
            handshaking should be performed  by the SDLC interface  and the
            external  system  to inform  each  other that  it  is  ready to
            considered the line to  be 'really' connected.  Please refer to
            EIA  RS-232-C  document   for  a   description  of   these  two
            electrical signals. If  'YES' is specified, the  SDLC interface
            will periodically check the DSR  signal to see if the  link has
            been disconnected.


         Default:  If  this statement  is  omited, the  default  is DTR/DSR
            signal handshaking required.


         Suggested Setting: If the external system has DTR/DSR handshaking,
            then this statement should be set to YES.

                    default: YES


         Level(s): Define  on Group  or Line  levels. Do  not define  on PU
            level.


         Dependancies: This statement is for secondary lines only.


         Description: This statement specifies whether a line is  connected
            to   VTAM/3705 hosts.  Any host  sytem which  supplies  the DTR
            signal the same way as the VTAM/3705 host will need to set this
            macro to YES. The VTAM/3705  will wait for a DSR  signal before
            raising DTR and  sending the ACTIVLINK command.  When VTAM(yes)
            is  chosen,  the  SDLC secondary  line  will  raise  DTR (which
            becomes  DSR to  the host)  and wait  for DSR.  If  VTAM(no) is
            chosen,  the  SDLC  secondary line  will  wait  for  DSR before
            raising  DTR. The  SWITCHED macro  will have  no effect  on how
            DTR/DSR is first raised; only the VTAM statement controls this.


         Suggested Setting: If the  host system will raise DTR  first, then
            set this macro to NO.  If the host system waits for  DSR before
            raising DTR  (such as  VTAM/3705), then set  the VTAM  macro to
            YES.

         Level(s): Define  on Group  or Line  levels. Do  not define  on PU
            level.


         Description: This statement  specifies the buffer space  in number
            of frames allocated for the transmit direction for each station
            on this line  or in this group.  If these buffers  become full,
            the  SDLC interface  will back  pressure the  network  for this
            particular circuit.


         Suggested Setting: If  the attached station normally  sends frames
            with maximum frame size  and in sequences of window  size, then
            the  XMTFRMQA should  be equal  to or  greater than  the window

  SDLC Counter/Timer Statements                            October 24, 1986






  7 - SDLC Counter/Timer Statements




       This  section describes  the  statements which  define  counters and
  timers.  Some of these counters and timers have their own statement, such
  as  NETREPLYTO and  RETRIES,  others can  only  be defined  by  using the
  LOPTION statement and  defining the line number,  name of the  counter or
  timer and the setting as arguments.


       Timers which are defined using the LOPTION statement are  TFP. (Fast
  Poll Timer),   TIR. (Information Timer),  TRP. (Polling  Response Timer),
  and TXR. (Transmit Complete Timer).


       Timers and counters which have their own statements  are NETREPLYTO,
  PAUSE, POLLRETRIES, POLLTIMER, REPLYTO and RETRIES.


       In  the following  descriptions for  each of  the counter  and timer
  statements, there are some assembly messages listed along with  the cause
  of these messages. To correct these messages, refer to the section titled
  Error Codes/Warning Messages.


       The  following  scenario has  been  included to  give  a  very basic
  overview of how the different counters and timers operate  together.  The
  meanings of  each timer variable  (t) and each  counter variable  (n) are
  explained  below.  These descriptions  only  reflect how  each  timer and
  counter participated in this particular scenario. For  further additional
  information on how each timer and counter operates refer to the following
  sections.

         Level(s): Define just  before ENDTYM statement  at the end  of the
            TYMFILE.  This  will insure  that  any  defaulted timer/counter
            values will be overwritten with the new value. All  stations on
            the  line will  have this  timer value.  Define for  Line level
            only.

         7.1.1 TFP.



         Syntax: LOPTION(line,TFP.,t)


         Argument(s):
                  line = line # (see LOPTION)
                  label = TFP.
                  t = tenths of a second
                      radix: hexadecimal
                      default: 0 tenths of a second


         Dependancies: Only  define for primary  lines. POLLTIM(t)  must be
            larger than or equal to TFP timer.


         Description: This is the fast poll (NRM) timer. This timer defines
            the  the time  delay between  RR and  RNR transmissions  from a
            primary port to a secondary station. The value of this timer is
            defined in tenths of a second.

            This timer does  not effect I or  U frame transmissions.  If an
            SDLC  information,  or   unnumbered  frame  was  ready   to  be
            transmitted before the TFP seconds delay was over,  the primary
            port  would  send  the  SDLC  information  or  unnumbered frame
            without delay.


         Suggested Setting: In most  cases this timer should be  left alone
            with the default value of  0 seconds. The only time  this value
            needs  to be  adjusted is  if too  many supervisory  frames are
            being received by the SDLC station from the SDLC  port. Usually
            an SDLC station  doesn't have a limit  to the frequency  of RRs
            and/or RNRs it can handle.


         This  timer must  be  larger than  the POLLTIM(t)  timer  to  work
            properly. The POLLTIM statement defines the time  delay between
            the last received  RR or RNR from  a secondary station  and the
            next RR or RNR transmission to that same station. Refer  to the
            section  describing  POLLTIM(t)  for  more   information.   For
            information on the  number of RRs or  RNRs a primary  port will
            send to a secondary station see POLLRETRIES section.


         Example:
                  LOPTION(4,TFP.,3)
                  If line 4 is a primary port then line 4 would
                  wait .3 sec. between sending RRs and/or RNRs
                  to a secondary station.

         7.1.2 TIR.


         Syntax: LOPTION(Line,TIR.,t)


         Argument(s):
                  Line = line number (see LOPTION)
                  Label = TIR.
                  t = half seconds
                      radix: decimal
                      default: 0 half seconds (t=0)


         Description:  This  is  an  information  frame  timer.  This timer
            controls how long an  SDLC primary or secondary port  waits for
            an I frame from the network before deciding whether to  send an
            RR or RNR to  the SDLC station. When  the SDLC port sends  an I
            frame to an SDLC  station, this timer is started. This timer is
            checked  each  time  the port  finds  no  SDLC  information, or
            unnumbered  frames  from  the  network.  If  the  timer  is not
            finished at this point, then nothing is sent and the  port will
            check  for SDLC  info., or  unnumbered frame  from  the network
            during the next foreground cycle. If the timer was  finished at
            this point, the port would decide whether to send an RR or RNR.
            When an RR or RNR is sent, the TIR timer is stopped. If no SDLC
            info., command, or response frames are received by the time the
            port is ready  to transmit again, then  the TIR timer  is still
            stopped and  either an  RR or RNR  will be  sent without  a TIR
            delay.


            When an RR or RNR  is first received from a  secondary station,
            the primary  port will delay  POLLTIM 1/4 seconds  before going
            into  transmit  mode  for that  station.  Once  this  timer has
            elapsed and the port is ready to transmit, it will check to see
            if there are any frames from the network to transmit.  If there
            are they are sent. If there aren't any network frames, the port
            will  not transmit  an RR  or RNR  until it  has been  TIR half
            seconds since the last I or U frame was sent to the station. If
            the TIR timer has elapsed, the TFP timer is checked to  see how
            long it  has been since  the last  RR or RNR  was sent  to this
            station.  If  this  timer is  finished  then  the  primary port
            decides whether to send an RR or an RNR to the  station without
            further delay.


         Suggested Setting: The only time  this value needs to be  non zero
            is when  there is  a very  long network  delay and  the station
            cannot handle too many RRs or RNRs from the SDLC interface.

         7.1.3 TRP.  Syntax: LOPTION(line,TRP.,t)


         Argument(s):
                  line = line # (see LOPTION)
                  label = TRP.
                  t = number of seconds
                      radix: hexadecimal
                      default: 1 second (t=1)


         Description: This timer is a primary port polling  response timer.
            When the primary port  sends an SNRM to the  secondary station,
            it will wait for TRP seconds before executing a polling receive
            timeout. If TRP seconds elapse without a UA or DM received from
            the secondary  station, the  primary port  will check  the SNRM
            polling pause timer and SNRM retries counters  (arguments  t, m
            and n from the RETRIES macro) to see when and  if  another SNRM
            should be sent  to the station.  Because of this  procedure, it
            only makes sense for the TPD timer to be smaller than  the SNRM
            polling pause timer.


         Suggested Setting: This timer is usually left at the default value
            of  one  second.  If  the  RETRIES macro  is  changed  from the
            default  (RETRIES(7,0,0)   where  zero  retries   sequences  is
            defined) to a value which enables the primary station  to retry
            the SNRM polling, then this TRP timer must be smaller  than the
            t argument for the new RETRIES settings.


         Example:
                  LOPTION(0,TRP.,3)
                  This macro defines the TRP timer for the 
                  primary line 0 to be 3 seconds.

         7.1.4 TXR.  Syntax: LOPTION(line,TXR.,t)


         Argument(s):
                  line = line # (see LOPTION)
                  label = TXR.
                  t = number of seconds
                      radix: hexadecimal
                      default: 3 seconds (t=3)


         Description: This timer is  a transmit complete timer.  Before the
            SDLC port will turn the line around it checks to make  sure the
            last transmitted frame is completely transmitted. The port will
            wait  TXR  seconds  for  the  transmission  to  complete before
            declaring a transmit timeout.


         Suggested  Setting:  The default  value  of 3  seconds  is usually
            sufficient.  The  minimum value  of this  timer can  be derived
            from the window size,  line speed, and maximum frame  size. The
            following equation should be used:

              TXR > (8 bit/char) * (windowsize) * (framesize)
                    -----------------------------------------
                              (line speed bits/sec)



            If the windowsize is 7, the max. framesize is 270 and  the line
            speed is 9600, then TXR should be calculated as follows:
                 TXR > (8*270*7)/9600
                 TXR > (1.5 sec.)
                 therefore; TXR =2 sec. would be the
                 best setting.

         Example:
                  LOPTION(5,TXR.,2)
                  Line 5 has a TXR setting of 2 seconds.

     7.2  NETREPLYTO



         Syntax: NETREPLYTO(T)


         Argument(s):
                  T = number of tenths of a second
                      radix: decimal
                      range: 0 < T < 256
                      default: 9 tenths of a sec. (t=9)


         Level: Group or Line levels only. Do not define on PU level.


         Dependancies: For secondary ports only.


         Description: This statement specifies the reply timeout  value for
            a secondary port waiting  for a response from network,  in 1/10
            seconds.   If  at the  expiration  of  this  interval  the SDLC
            interface  has  not received  from  the network  a  response to
            polling (SNRM), to an XID frame,  or to a TEST frame,  it makes
            an attempt to switch from  the state of waiting for  a response
            from network to  the state of  checking any polling  or message
            text from the external system.


         Suggested Setting: This timer should not be greater than  the SNRM
            polling interval being used by the host. Since this interval is
            usually  1  second a  NETREPLYTO  default value  of  .9  sec is
            usually enough.


         Example:
                  NETREPLYTO(6)
                  This statement sets the NETREPLTO timer 
                  (TNR.) for a secondary group/line/station
                  to .6 seconds.

            level.


         Dependancies: Only for primary ports.


         Description: This statement specifies the average duration  of the
            SNRM polling cycle in  seconds. The polling cycle  extends from
            the moment an SNRM is sent to station A until the next  SNRM is
            sent to station A on the  same line. If the time expended  in a
            complete polling cycle equals or exceeds the time specified  as
            t,  the next  polling cycle  begins immediately.  If,  the time
            expended  in  a complete  polling  cycle is  less  that  t, the
            beginning of the next polling cycle is deferred until t seconds
            have elapsed.  During the  pause,  the SDLC  link is  in "POLL-
            WAIT" state;  any outgoing data  ready for transmission  to the
            SDLC terminal stations on  the link is sent during  this pause.
            For more counters and timers controlling SNRM polling,  see the
            RETRIES macro.


            Allowing  a  pause  to  elapse when  activity  on  the  link is
            relatively  low  can  reduce  the  amount  of  processing  time
            consumed by unproductive polling.


         Suggested Setting: If there are stations on a line which are going
            to remain inactive for long periods, the pause macro  should be
            set to a long delay. This will avoid many unanswered polls from
            the primary to the secondary station.


             If a one to one  relationship between the SNRMs sent  from the
            host  and  the  SNRMs  sent from  the  primary  station  to the
            secondary station  is desired, then  the pause macro  should be
            set to the same  value as the host  is using. In this  case the
            RETRIES macro  should also be  set up to  reflect a one  to one
            correspondence (see RETRIES statement).

     7.4  POLLRETRIES



         Syntax: POLLRETRIES(m)


         Argument(s):
                  m = number of retries, or 255 for continuous
                      radix: decimal
                      default: 7 retries (m=7)


         Level(s):  Group and/or  Line  levels only.  Do not  define  on PU
            level.


         Dependancies: For primary stations only.


         Description:  This statement  specifies the  number  of sequential
            RNRs which may be sent  from the CU (secondary station)  to the
            primary port,  before the link  is reinitialized.  This counter
            will solve the situation  where the CU continuously  sends RNRs
            to the primary port  (something is wrong with  the controller).
            If m is set to 255 then an infinite number of RNRs  is accepted
            from the secondary station.


         Suggested Setting: The  default value of 7  should be used.  It is
            very unusual for more than 7 RNRs in a row to be sent  from the
            secondary station to the primary port.


         Example:
                  POLLRETRIES(3)
                  The RNR retries counter for this group
                  or line will be 3.

     7.5  POLLTIMER



         Syntax: POLLTIMER(t)


         Argument(s):
                t = number of 1/4 seconds
                    radix: decimal
                    default: 1/4 second (t=1 if point to point)
                             0 seconds  (t=0 if multi point)


         Level(s): Define on Group  and/or Line levels only. Do  not define
            on PU level.


         Dependancies: This statement is for primary lines only.


         Description: This statement specifies the primary  port's response
            time to a received RR or RNR.


            When the primary port receives an RR from a  secondary station,
            a response RR or RNR  is not sent until at least  t*1/4 seconds
            have elapsed. After POLLTIM timer has elapsed, the primary port
            will check  the TIR timer  to see if  enough timer has  gone by
            since the last I, or U frame was sent to the  secondary station
            before an RR  or RNR can be  sent. When the TIR  timer expires,
            the primary port  checks the TFP timer  to see how long  it has
            been since the past supervisory poll to this station.  Once the
            TFP time has expired,  the primary port will decide  whether to
            send an RR or RNR to the station without further delay.


            For information on how many supervisory frames the primary port
            will handle, see the POLLRETRIES section.


         Suggested Setting:  If only one  station (PU statement)  is define
            for this  primary line,  then the line  is considered  point to
            point.  If more  than one  is defined,  the line  is considered
            multi point.  The default  for point to  point and  multi point
            lines differ. Since there is  more than one station on  a multi
            point  line,  the time  spent  servicing each  station  must be
            quicker than  for point to  point, otherwise the  response time
            for each station is lengthened.


            The default  for this timer  is usually sufficient.  This timer
            should be smaller than TIR and TFP timers.

                  t = number of seconds

            level.


         Dependancies: For primary  lines only.


         Description: This statement specifies the reply timeout  value, in
            seconds, for the  primary lines in this  line group. If  at the
            expiration of this interval the SDLC interface has not received
            from the external system  a response to polling, or  to message
            text,  it makes  no further  attempt to   communicate  with the
            external system. Instead, it indicates that a timeout error has
            occurred.


         Suggested Setting: This value should not be smaller than  the time
            required for a windowsize  of maximum frame sized frames  to be
            received  from the  line (refer  to the  formula in  TXR. timer

     7.7  RETRIES



         Syntax: RETRIES(m,t,n)


         Argument(s):
                  m = number of retries or 
                       continuous (m=128) retries
                      radix: decimal
                      range: 0 =< m < 128
                      default: 7 retries (m=7)
                  t = number of seconds
                      radix: decimal
                      range: 0 =< t < 256
                      default: 0 seconds (t=0)
                  n = number of retry sequences
                      radix: decimal
                      range: 0 =< n < 128
                      default: 0 sequences (n=0)


         Level(s): Define on Group  and/or Line levels only. Do  not define
            on PU level.


         Dependancies: Secondary  lines should have  the t and  n arguments
            set to 0 (the default values).


         Description:  For  primary  lines,  this  statement  specifies the
            number of normal disconnect mode SNRM, XID and TEST  frames the
            primary will send  to a secondary  station while waiting  for a
            response from the station. For secondary lines,  this statement
            specifies the number of  normal disconnect mode SNRM,  XID, and
            TEST  frames the  secondary will  ignore from  the  host  while
            waiting  for  a  response from  the  network.  This  macro also
            specifies how  many unanswered  NRM polls  a primary  line will
            tolerate before disconnecting the line.


            This statement specifies the number of retry sequences (n), the
            pause in between the  sequences (t), and the number  of retries
            (n) in each sequence.


            The  secondary  line  uses  only  the  first  argument  of this
            statement (m).  If an SNRM, XID or TEST frame is  received from
            the host during NDM,  the secondary will send the  frame across
            the  network  to the  primary  line.  The  secondary  will wait
            NETREPLYTO tenths of  a second before  for a response  from the

  SDLC Counter/Timer Statements                            October 24, 1986


            network before returning to receive mode. If a  receive timeout
            occurs or another XID is received, the secondary will decrement
            the retries counter (m) and check again for a response from the
            network. If a response from the network is found, it is sent to
            the primary station and the secondary line stops looking  for a
            network  response.  If no  response  is found  and  the retries
            counter reaches 0, the  secondary line will ignore  any network
            responses until something is received again from the host.


            The primary line  uses all 3  arguments. The primary  line only
            uses the RETRIES statement for SNRM polling and counting number
            of receive  timeouts (not  for XID or  TEST). When  the primary
            receives an SNRM in NDM (and not waiting for UA  response), the
            SNRM  is sent  to  the secondary  station. The  PAUSE  and TRP.
            timers  are   started at  this  point. If  a  UA or  DM  is not
            received by the time the  TRP. timer has expired AND  there are
            more retries (m<>0), then the primary will wait until the PAUSE
            timer has expired and then send another SNRM to the station. If
            a UA  or DM  is received then  the primary  goes to  NDM, stops
            looking for responses from the station, and sends the  frame to
            the network.


            The  primary uses  the first  argument to  count the  number of
            receive timeouts during NRM.  A receive timeout occurrs  when a
            poll is sent to the secondary station without a  response being
            received from the station within REPLTO number of seconds.


            When the  retries counter  m reaches zero  and no  response has
            been  received from  the  secondary station,  the  primary will
            pause (t seconds) and then send n number of  retries sequences.
            If t or n is  zero the primary will not send  anymore sequences
            of retries.  If m  is 255 it  is never  decremented, continuous
            retries are sent.


         Suggested  Setting: The  default  values are  usually  the desired
            values for both  the primary and secondary  lines. If a  one to
            one correspondence of SNRM, XID and/or TEST frames is required,
            set  the RETRIES  at both  the primary  and secondary  lines to
            RETRIES(1,0,0).


         Example:
                  RETRIES(4,2,3)
                  This statement specifies the number of
                  retries sequences to be 3, the pause 
                  between these sequnces to be 2 seconds,
                  and the number of retires in each sequence
                  to be 4.

       The assembling  of an SDLC  Interface may produces  diagnostic error
  messages  or warning  messages.  The errors  must be  corrected,  but the
  warning messages may be just ignored.


       The formats of these messages are as follows:


       *** ERROR nn *** Macro_Statement_1 <-> Macro_Statement_2

       or
