       *   This is the first release of the Private Line Pricer program,  *
       *   Version 3.0.  We realize that the field has not had a fully    *
       *   released and fully supported private line pricer program in    *
       *   several years.  Even though PLP, version 3.0 is not entirely   *
       *   complete, we are fully releasing version 3.0 for internal use  *
       *   only.                                                          *

       *   The component of the PLP that is not complete is batch mode.   *
       *   At the present, batch mode does not produce a readable report. *
       *   We are currently working on several output reports.  These     *
       *   reports will be completed by the second release of PLP.        *
       *   Batch mode does not have the ability to price out a leased     *
       *   line with conditioning.  We will be reviewing this issue at    *
       *   a later date.                                                  *

       *   This document is not fully complete.  The Batch Mode section   *

    Private Line Pricer, Version 3.0

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


       I.  INTRODUCTION

           A.  OVERVIEW

               The Private Line Pricer program (PLP), ver. 3.0 is a program
               which computes the cost of a dedicated leased line between
               two end points.  PLP may be used for pricing leased lines on
               dedicated (Private) networks or shared (Public) network ser-
               vices for STI, PAP, and DCF.  The program is located on an
               internal IBM mainframe, System 43, and can be used in either
               interactive or batch mode.

               The program's tariff information is provided by CCMI McGraw
               Hill's QTEL 9000 database which contains information on var-
               ious voice grade and data line carriers as well as dialing
               rates. Pricing for Intrastate - Intralata lines is based on
               the RBOC tariffs.  Tariffs for common carriers such as AT&T
               and MCI are provided for Intrastate - Interlata and Inter-
               state - Interlata leased lines.                                   

               The QTEL 9000 database is updated once a month with current
               rate information and quarterly with new area code and pre-
               fixes. The QTEL 9000 is also the source for another major
               software sales tool program, the Direct Distance Dialing
               program (DDD).



           B.  ADVANTAGES OVER PREVIOUS PROGRAMS

               PLP, ver. 3.0 is fully supported by Operations, Marketing,
               and MIS at Tymnet Headquarters.  Other versions of this pro-
               gram, previously provided by Tymnet, are no longer supported
               or updated at this time.  

               Tariff information for PLP, ver. 3.0 is verified on a regu-
               lar basis by calling various Local Bell companies and common
               carriers and pricing out random leased lines.

               PLP, ver. 3.0 is easy to use and understand.  The program
               presents information in two ways:  A summary report or in
               detail format.

               The program provides pricing information on local circuits,
               long distance circuits and D1 conditioning for both instal-
               lation and monthly charges.


           C.  SUPPORT

               If you have any questions or problems with either the program

      II.  DETERMINING THE NEAREST TSO FOR LEASED LINES


           A.  SITE AVAILABILITY REPORT

               The Site Availability report is located on a PDP-10, system
               23.   This report is very useful and easy to retrieve.

               This report includes a listing of all TYMNET nodes, their
               location (State and City), NPA/NXX, site number, class of node,
               whether ISIS is available at that site, density of node, status
               of site, and any site limitations.  This report will enable
               users to determine what sites certain network connections or
               leased lines can be engineered into.

               The following is an explanation of the class restrictions:

               CLASS 1     -   Can accommodate any speed of line including a
                               56 KB

               CLASS 2    -   Can accommodate a 19.2 or less

               CLASS 3    -   Can accommodate a 9.6 or less

               CLASS 4    -   Can accommodate a 4.8 or less

               CLASS 5    -   Public Async Access ONLY


               The following illustrates how to print the SITE AVAILABILITY
               REPORT:

           B.  NETWORK PROFILE DATABASE

               The Network Profile Database has many useful functions.  One
               being, the "TYMNET NODE WITHIN A MILEAGE RADIUS" Search.
               This search used in conjunction with the site availability
               report will assist the sales force with customer proposals
               in determining what the closest available TYMNET site would
               be to configure a network connection or dedicated leased
               line into.

               Given an origination point, area code and prefix (NPA/NXX)
               by the user, this search will provide node number, site num-
               ber, location, type of software available at the site, and
               mileage to the nearest Tymnet nodes depending on the mileage
               restriction provided by the user.

               In order to execute the Private Line Pricer, the user must
               have both origination and termination area code and prefix.
               The "TYMNET NODE WITHIN A MILEAGE RADIUS" Search will pro-
               vide the closest TSO and the Site availability report will
               supply the site class information and the site area code and
               prefix needed for PLP.

               When using the "TYMNET NODE WITHIN A MILEAGE RADIUS" search
               to determine actual mileage, caution should be used since
               the mileage listed is only an estimate and is based on area
               code and prefix and not based on actual address location.

               To access the NETWORK PROFILE DATABASE and perform the TYM-
               NET node search, simply follow the sample run below:

     III.  PRIVATE LINE PRICER - MODES OF EXECUTION

           The Private Line Pricer program can be executed in two modes:
           Interactive or Batch.  When the interactive mode is executed,
           the user manually enters the leased line information as the pro-
           gram  requests it.  In batch mode, the user creates an input
           file containing the leased line data.  The input file is auto-
           matically read into the program when the PLP is executed.  There
           is no user interaction while the program is running in batch
           mode.


           A.  INTERACTIVE  MODE

               The PLP prompts for the information listed below.  Where it
               is designated optional (only seen in documentation), the
               user can either enter the information or enter a carriage
               return.  A carriage return is necessary after each entry is
               complete.  (Section IV contains sample runs.)

               - Pricing option:  Pricing option #1, 2-PT Private Line
                 Pricing is option for leased line pricing.        

               - Origination and destination area code and prefix

               - Mileage (Enter zero or is optional)

               - Carrier code: (ATT, BOC, MCI, etc..)

               - Service Type:  Analog, Digital, High-speed.  Analog is
                 the only service type we currently have pricing for.
                 Digital pricing will be available in the near future.

               - Channel Types:  VG 2-wire, VG 4-wire, VG/Data 2-wire,
                 or VG/Data 4-wire.  (Use VG/DATA 4-Wire option.)

               - Effective date (optional)


               The interactive program has default values for each prompt.
               The default values are located in the [ ] brackets.  These
               default values change everytime the prompt is answered with
               anything except a carriage return.  The new default values
               will remain in effect until the user changes them or logs
               out of PLP.                                                       

               In the mileage fields, the mileage default is always zero.         
               If the user gives a value other than zero for mileage, this
               value will remain the default until it is changed again or
               the user logs out of the program and then the mileage will
               automatically return to zero.  The default value for the
               date field is always the current date unless the user
               specifies differently.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


               Detail output is available in interactive mode only.  The
               output provides the carrier information, total charges, and
               optional charges in complete detail.  These total charges DO
               NOT include Tymnet's additional 15% charge.

               To execute the interactive Private Line Pricer follow the
               simple instructions below.

               B.  BATCH MODE


               In order to run the batch mode, the user also needs the same
               information that was requested in the interactive mode.  The
               information is, however, written in a file on the IBM sys-
               tem.  The output is also put to a file versus to the terminal.    
               The input file must be of the format below:

               Pricing Option              - 1 numeric character
               Origination Area code (NPA) - 3 digits; numeric only
               Origination Prefix (NXX)    - 3 digits; numeric only
               Mileage (optional)          - 7 characters; numeric,
                                              or blank
               Destination Area code (NPA) - 3 digits; numeric only
               Destination Prefix (NXX)    - 3 digits; numeric only
               Mileage (optional)          - 7 characters; numeric,
                                              or blank
               Carrier                     - 3 alpha characters and
                                             1 space
               Service Type                - 1 alpha character
               Channel Type                - 1 numeric character
               Effective date (optional)   - date format of YYYYMMDD
                                             or blank


               Sample input file:

                        140892200000004084320000000BOC A41988021
               or       141577300000004156240000000BOC A4
               or       1612543       612724       BOC A4

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


               In order to execute the PLP in batch mode, the input file
               must have a filetype of "INPUT".  The PLP will automatically
               give the output file a filetype of "OUTPUT".

               If blanks are used for any field, the PLP program will use
               the either the standard program defaults or the values used
               in the previous line or record.   The values for each entry
               will remain in effect until the user changes them or logs
               out of the program.

               The batch mode provides a summary report only.  The summary
               report includes the origination and destination area codes
               and prefixes, total monthly charges and total installation
               charges.  These total charges DO NOT include Tymnet's addi-
               tional 15% charge for leased lines.  The batch mode output
               also does not provide D1 conditioning charges at this time.


               To execute batch mode, follow the instructions below:

               ---------------------------------------------------

               FILENAME1 = The input filename.  The filetype is not
               needed as the program will assume a filetype of "INPUT".

               FILENAME2 = The output filename.  The filetype is not
               needed either.  The program will assign a filtype of
               "OUTPUT".

               See Section IV for further information on creating an input
               file.

      IV.  THE IBM ENVIRONMENT


           A.  CREATING THE INPUT FILE FOR BATCH MODE

               There are several way to create your input file to run PLP
               in batch mode.  (1)  Create your file on the IBM system.  
               (2) Create your file on a PDP-10, system 38 for example,
               and telecopy the file to system 43.  (3)  Create the input
               file on a PC and upload the file to system 43.  


               1.  The user need not be familiar with IBM or its commands
               to create an input file on the IBM mainframe.  Listed below
               is an example of the EDITOR program showing how to create a
               an input file.


                  --------------------------------------------------

                  |   I>                                           |
                  |   E>FILE TEST INPUT A1                         |
                  |   R; T=0.01/0.03 20:33:16                      |
                  |   43>                                          |
                  --------------------------------------------------


               To execute the IBM Editor, simply type EDIT, the filename
               with filetype and disk address.  "E" signifies edit mode.         

               In the sample above, "TEST1" is the filename with the file-
               type "INPUT". "A1" is the address of the file.  All files
               must have an address.  It will be less confusing if the user
               assigns address A1 to all his/her files.

               As mentioned earlier, all PLP input files must have the
               filetype "INPUT".

               "I" in edit mode, stands for input.  As long as the user has
               the "I" prompt, everything that is being typed will be
               included in the file.  To write the file to disk, enter a
               carriage return at the input prompt "I" and file (write) the
               file to disk.

               2.  Creating a batch file on a DEC PDP-10 and telecoping the
               file to system 43 is another option users have.  If this
               option is used, simply create the input file on system 38 or
               another PDP-10 and then use the "Telecopy" command to move
               a copy of the file to system 43.  When the file is telecopied
               to system 43, the file will be given a filetype "TELECOPY".
               The user must rename the file and give it a filetype "INPUT".
               The record format and record length must be changed to
               fixed with a record length of 80 in order for the PLP
               program to read the file.

               Below, is a sample of this option with the necessary rename
               and file format change commands:

               3.  Creating an input file on a PC and uploading the file to
               system 43 is probably the easiest method there is.   Create
               the input file in the correct format in a word processing
               software package and save the file in Ascii format.  Log on
               to system 43 and by using the "COPYPC" command, upload the
               file.  A sample of the "COPYPC" command is illustrated below.     
               COPYPC is only available if you are using TYMCOMM.  If you
               are using XTALK, use the "SEND" command to upload the file.

               WHERE: PCFILE represents the "From File".  The PC drive and
               sub-directory needs to be specified.  If the file is on
               drive C and sub-directory DOS, the format would be:

                       COPYPC C:\DOS\FILE IBMFILE INPUT A1

               COPYPC can also work in the reverse.  A user can download an
               IBM file to the PC by switching the order of filenames.

                       COPYPC IBMFILE INPUT A1 C:\DOS\FILE


               Type "LIST  Filename Filetype  (L " to make sure the file
               has the correct record lenght and format.  If it does not
               use the copy command illustrated on the previous page
               to change the record length and file format.

           B.  VARIOUS CMS COMMANDS

               The list of IBM commands below will be very helpful to users
               who are new to the IBM environment.


               LIST  - Is synonomous to the "DIR" command on the PDP-10s.
                       "LIST" will display all files in the user's direc-
                       tory. Variables of the "LIST" command include:

                     - LIST TEST * A1 - Will display all files named TEST
                       with any filetype and address A1.

                     - LIST TEST INPUT A1 (L - Will list the named file as
                       well as various information pertaining to that par-
                       ticular file such as disk address, format, record
                       length, number of records, number of blocks, creation
                       date and time.                                            

               ERASE - Will delete a file(s).  In order to erase a file,
                       the filename (at least in part) needs to be speci-
                       fied.                                                     

                     - ERASE TEST * will delete all files named test with
                       any filetype.                                             

               TYPE  - Will print to a terminal any file specified.  The
                       complete filename must be used.  Wild characters (*)
                       will not work.                                            

              RENAME - Will rename a file to another filename.

                     - RENAME TEST1 DATA A1 TEST1 INPUT A1
                       (Renamed the file TEST1 filetype DATA on the A1 disk
                        to file TEST1 filetype INPUT on the A1 disk)

              Q DISK - Will show the user how many blocks of storage and
                       what percentage of storage has been used.

                COPY - Will make a copy of the file or can be used to
                       change record format and record length.

                     - COPY TEST1 INPUT A1 (RECFM F LRECL 80
                       In this example, the record format is changed to
                       F for fixed and record length 80.

       <ESC> <CR> HX - To log out of the program at any time during
                       execution and return to the 43> prompt.

                       DO NOT type <ESC>, instead enter the escape key.
                       <CR> stands for carriage return.  HX is typed at
                       the ??> prompt.

               LOG -   Will log the user off the system.

      VI.  INTERPRETING THE RESULTS


           A.  RESULTS FROM INTERACTIVE MODE

               The results from interactive mode is very detailed.  The
               first 5 lines is a summary.  It states the origination and
               destination information (NPA/NXX, city, state and lata) of
               the line based on the input.

               The total required charges is the base price for the leased
               line and does not include any optional charges.  Optional
               charges need to be added to the total.  Optional charges
               include:

                    -  Order charges
                    -  Visit charges
                    -  D1 Conditioning charges only.

               D1 conditioning charges are added to totals if the line
               required is a 9.6 line or higher.  4.8 or lower does not
               need to be conditioned.  In the detailed output, D1 charges
               are coded:  0020, 0030, 0035, 0208, 0236, and 0334.               
               The majority of leased lines with only contain one of these
               codes.

               Any other optional charges with codes other than the D1
               codes, order charges and visit charges are not required.

     VII.  TROUBLESHOOTING PROBLEMS AND COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS


           1.  I can not get into the Private Line Pricer program.

               Most likely, you do not have the proper Profile exec file
               in your directory which authorizes users to access the
               program.  Call Stephanie Hamik for access

           2.  I'm running in the Interactive mode and I can't get any
               pricing.  What is wrong?

               The problem could be:

               a.  Invalid area codes or prefixes for either the origination
                   or destination numbers.
               b.  The area codes or prefixes are too new and have not been
                   added to the PLP master rate file.

               To check to see if either a or b is your problem, look at the
               error message for the LATA information.  If any of the LATAs
               are 0000, the area code and prefix you have entered is not
               in the master rate file and your problem is either a or b.

               c.  You are trying to price an Intrastate - Intralata line
                   with ATT or and Intrastate - Intralata or and Interstate
                   line with a BOC

                Try running the program again using the other type of carrier.

           3.  I am running the PLP using Batch mode and it won't work.
               What am I doing wrong?

               a.  Make sure you are entering the correct command.
               b.  Make sure your input file has the filetype of "INPUT".
               c.  Type  "LIST" at the 43> to ensure that you don't have
                   an output file.  The PLP runs so quickly in Batch mode,
                   that you might not think that it is working.

           4.  I can't log into my directory.

               a.  Your username is not valid for system 43 or
               b.  A terminal is already logged into system 43 with you
                   username.

               In the IBM environment, only 1 user can use one username
               at one time

           5.  Can I get pricing from a BOC and a common carrier (ATT)
               for comparison?

               NO.  Local Bell companies handle local lines and common
               carriers handle non-local lines.  Therefore, pricing does
               not exist for comparisons.
