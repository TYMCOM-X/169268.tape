1.0 INTRODUCTION TO MLINK


     MLINK is BSO's general-purpose microprocessor  cross-linkage
editor.  It reads relocatable or absolute files in BSO format and
links these modules together to produce an absolute  load  module
in  BSO  format.  This absolute object data can then be used with
BSO's  simulator/debuggers,   converted   to   any   of   several
microprocessor  manufacturers'  absolute  object formats by BSO's
OBJCNV  utility,  or  optionally  used  as  absolute  input  into
subsequent linkages.


     The input files to the Cross-Linkage Editor  are  always  in
BSO format.  BSO's object format files can consist of one or more
relocatable object modules (produced by  BSO's  relocating  cross
assemblers), one or more absolute load modules (produced by BSO's
absolute cross assemblers, OBJCNV  conversion  of  manufacturer's
absolute  format,  or MLINK's output), and object library modules
(produced from relocatable modules by BSO's  librarian  program).
Output files consist of an absolute load module in BSO format and
(optionally)  a  load  map  listing,  showing  where  relocatable
sections were loaded in absolute memory, the values of global and
(optionally) local symbols, and other information.


     MLINK,  together  with  BSO's  relocating  assemblers   also
support   a   relocatable   expression   feature   which  permits
arbitrarily  complex   expressions   (consisting   of   absolute,
relocatable,  and  external  global  symbols) to be passed by the
assembler to MLINK,  which  then  resolves  the  expressions  and
includes  their  values  where  indicated  in  the  absolute load
module.


     MLINK includes a "verb style" command processor which allows
the  user  to  specify  parameters and instructions via full-word
commands to the program.  Each command may be abbreviated to  its
first   few   letters;   the  minimum  length  of  an  acceptable
abbreviation for a command keyword is governed by whether or  not
such  an  abbreviation  would  uniquely  define the command.  For
example, two of the  command  keywords  supported  by  MLINK  are
"INPUT"  and "INCLUDE".  The "INPUT" command could be abbreviated
if desired to the  letters  "INP"  or  "INPU",  or  spelled  out,
"INPUT";   the  "INCLUDE"  command could be abbreviated to "INC",
"INCL", "INCLU", "INCLUD", or spelled out,  "INCLUDE".   However,
the  abbreviations  "I"  or  "IN"  would  be  invalid  for  these
commands, since the  abbreviations  are  ambiguous;   they  could
stand for either "INPUT" or "INCLUDE".


                                                           Page 6


     A typical session with MLINK could be broken up  into  three
logical  segments.  The first phase involves the specification of
files to be used in the linking process.  During this phase,  the
user  specifies  the  names  of  all  the input files and all the
output files.  Also during  this  phase,  MLINK  checks  for  the
existence  and  validity of each of the input files, and collects
information for each one.


     The second phase of a MLINK session involves the setting  of
parameters by the user which govern the base addresses of program
sections, the order in which sections are loaded.


     The final phase is the actual generation of the  object  and
map files.  It occurs automatically, without user intervention.


     Each of  these  segments  is  documented  in  the  following
sections.  A summary of commands appears in Appendix A at the end
of this document.
                                                           Page 7


2.0 PHASE I - FILE SPECIFICATION

     Before beginning phase I of a MLINK session, the  user  must
run the Cross Linkage Editor program.  This is done by typing the
command

          -R MLINK

at monitor level.  MLINK, in turn, will  respond  with  a  header
message and a command prompt:

          Cross Linkage Editor 
          Copyright, The Boston Systems Office, Inc.  1979
          (617) 894-7800
          For help type "HELP"

          /

     At this point, MLINK is waiting for the user to specify  the
names  of  the  files  with  which  it  will  work.  The commands
applicable  (all  typed  in  response  to  the  "/"  prompt)  are
summarized below:


INPUT filespec[,filespec,filespec,...]

     This command specifies input files for the linkage  process.
     Each  file  listed  is  read immediately in order to collect
     global symbol and section size information;  the  files  are
     also  each  read a second time during phase 3 of the linkage
     process.  Each file must be in BSO format  and  may  contain
     one  or  more  modules.   All  modules  in each file will be
     included in the linkage.  If manufacturer Absolute files are
     needed  as  input  to MLINK, they must first be converted to
     BSO format by OBJCNV.

     Each file specification "filespec" in the command is of  the
     general form:

          dev:filename.ext[dir]

     where "dev" is a device name (e.g.  "DTA0:" for DECtape unit
     0),  and  can  be  omitted  to use the user's default system
     device;  "[dir]" is the  directory  in  which  the  file  is
     stored,  and  can  be  omitted  to  use  the  user's default
     directory area;  and "filename.ext" is the 1 to 6  character
     filename  and  1 to 3 character file extension (if extension
     is omitted, ".ROB" is assumed).

     Example:
          /INPUT ABC,DEF.XXX

     This command would specify input load  modules  ABC.ROB  and
     DEF.XXX.

     As many INPUT commands may be specified as necessary to name
     all  the  input files for the linkage process.  Each command
                                                           Page 8


     must be followed by at least  one  file  specification,  but
     several may be specified, separated by commas.


LIBRARY filespec

     This command loads the  specified  file  in  library  search
     mode.  Only those modules which resolve currently unresolved
     global references will be included in the  linkage  process.
     All  modules contained in the file are scanned.  If the file
     was produced by BSO's librarian program, this search can  be
     completed  relatively  quickly.  If the file was not created
     as  a  library   file   by   the   librarian,   MLINK   will
     unconditionally  include all modules in the linkage process.
     Files are assumed to have the default extension ".LIB".

     Example:
          / LIBRARY MATH,FOR.

     would cause MATH.LIB and FOR.  (with a null extension) to be
     loaded in library search mode.


PDEFAULT

     This command, which takes no arguments, is used  to  request
     that  MLINK  show  the  current default absolute object file
     format.  This is the default format that  will  be  produced
     when OBJCNV converts the Linker's output to a manufacturer's
     object format.  This format can always  be  overridden  when
     OBJCNV  is  run;  it is only a default indication to OBJCNV.
     This indicator is obtained from the first input file.  

     Example:
          / PDEFAULT
          Default format:  INTEL, Micro Type:  8086

          /


OUTPUT filespec

     This command specifies the name of the  output  file  to  be
     produced by the MLINK session.  The file specification (only
     one is permitted) is of the same form as is described  under
     the INPUT command.  The output file is in BSO format and has
     a default extension of ".ABS".

     Example:
          /OUTPUT PROG

     specifies an output file named PROG.ABS.

     An OUTPUT command may be given at any time during Phase I or
     Phase II of the MLINK session, and a new OUTPUT command will
     override any previous OUTPUT commands.
                                                           Page 9


OUTPUT:type filespec

     This command is identical to  the  OUTPUT  command,  but  it
     accepts  an  output object format (type) as well as the name
     of the output  file.   This  "type"  overrides  the  default
     format  indicator  supplied  by  the input files as they are
     being read.  The valid formats are listed in Appendix B.

     Example:
          /OUTPUT:INTEL PROG2

     The above command  would  create  an  absolute  output  file
     called "PROG2.ABS".  INTEL format will be produced by OBJCNV
     by default.


NOOUTPUT

     If no OUTPUT commands are given to MLINK,  the  program  can
     operate  in a mode which produces no output load module, but
     still verifies the validity of various parameters given in a
     session  and  possibly  produces  a load map (if requested).
     Once an OUTPUT command is given, the program is  set  up  to
     produce  an  output  file  of the specified name and format.
     Should the user decide at some point after issuing an OUTPUT
     command  that  he  really does not want an output file after
     all, he may type the NOOUTPUT command,  returning  MLINK  to
     the initial condition of having no output object file.

     Example:
          /OUTPUT FOO
          /NOOUTPUT
          /

     In the above sequence of commands, the user first  specified
     an  output  file  in default format called FOO.ABS, and then
     cancelled the specification by issuing a NOOUTPUT command.

     NOOUTPUT may actually be specified at any time before typing
     the GO command (i.e., any time during Phase I or Phase II of
     the MLINK session).


MAP filespec

     This command specifies the name of a load map file to MLINK.
     The load map is a text file which lists the locations of the
     program sections and global symbols  in  the  absolute  load
     module  developed  during the linkage process.  The load map
     is produced at the beginning of phase III of a MLINK session
     (immediately  after  the  GO  command  is  given).  The file
     specification is of the same format  as  described  earlier,
     and the map file has a default file extension of ".MAP".

     Example:
          /MAP JOE
                                                          Page 10


     specifies a map file named JOE.MAP.


NOMAP

     The NOMAP command functions like  the  NOOUTPUT  command  in
     that it cancels a previous MAP command.  It may be specified
     any time before the GO command is given.

INCLUDE keyword
EXCLUDE keyword

     The map file output produced by MLINK normally contains  the
     values of global symbols used in the linkage process.  These
     two commands may be used to change what types of symbols are
     listed  in  the  load map (if one is produced).  The INCLUDE
     command specifies that the named type of  symbol  SHOULD  be
     included  in the map;  EXCLUDE specifies that it should NOT.
     The keywords associated  with  INCLUDE  and  EXCLUDE,  their
     defaults with respect to inclusion, and the types of symbols
     they represent are shown below:

     Keyword   Default   Category of symbols
     
     GLOBALS   INCLUDE   Global (intermodule) symbols
     LOCALS    EXCLUDE   Local (module-specific) symbols
     ZERO      INCLUDE   Symbols from zero-length modules
     ALL       see text  All symbols

     Notes on above:

     1- The keyword "ZERO" refers  to  those  symbols  which  are
     defined  in  modules  which  generate no code, i.e., modules
     which contain only symbol definitions.  The action  of  this
     keyword  is  to some degree dependent on what other keywords
     are supplied.  In particular, "INCLUDE ZERO" does not  force
     all  local  symbols  from  zero-length modules when "EXCLUDE
     LOCALS" has been specified.  The  main  use  of  the  "ZERO"
     keyword  is in the "EXCLUDE ZERO" command.  It would cause a
     symbol to be excluded from the load map if that symbol  were
     defined in a module which generated no code but only defined
     symbols.

     2- The keyword "ALL"  implies  all  of  the  above-mentioned
     categories,  and  its  default is really neither INCLUDE nor
     EXCLUDE.  The command "INCLUDE ALL" would cause ALL types of
     symbols  to  be  included  in  the  load  map;   the command
     "EXCLUDE ALL" would cause NO symbols to be included.

     Examples:
          /INCLUDE LOCALS
          /EXCLUDE ZERO
          /

     In the above sequence of commands, a user specifies that his
     load  map should include local symbols from each module, but
     that no symbols from zero-length modules should  be  printed
                                                          Page 11


     in the load map.

     3- Note that in order  to  enable  the  inclusion  of  local
     symbols  in any case requires the "/D" (debug) switch set in
     the command input line to the cross  assembler  at  assembly
     time.

PASS keyword
NOPASS keyword

     When the absolute file produced by a MLINK session is to  be
     used  with  one of BSO's symbolic simulator/debuggers, it is
     desirable to include a program symbol table with the  object
     module  to  make  debugging  easier at simulation time.  The
     PASS and NOPASS commands control what types of  symbols,  if
     any,  are  to  be included in the absolute output file.  The
     keyword argument is either "LOCALS",  "GLOBALS",  or  "ALL".
     The  default (initial) condition is "NOPASS ALL", which says
     to not put any symbol definitions in the output  file.   The
     PASS  command  may  be used to specify which types are to be
     included ("LOCALS" for local symbols, "GLOBALS"  for  global
     symbols, "ALL" for all symbols -- local and global).  NOPASS
     complements   PASS   and   can   be   used   to   counteract
     previously-specified erroneous PASS commands.

     Example:
          /PASS ALL

     This command causes all  local  and  global  symbols  to  be
     included in the absolute output file.

DISABLE section_name[,section_name,...]
ENABLE section_name[,section_name,...]

     Specified sections may be excluded from the  current  output
     file with the DISABLE command.  

     When the "GO" command is given (Sec.5.0), all sections which
     have not been DISABLEd are linked, producing an output file.
     After the linkage has been completed, MLINK returns  to  the
     state  it was in just before the "GO" command was given (all
     previously input files are available to be linked  according
     to  previously  specified parameters).  The user may at this
     point specify a new  output  file,  and  ENABLE  or  DISABLE
     various  sections.   The subsequent linkage will include the
     new combination of sections.

     DISABLE and ENABLE commands would be useful, for example, to
     a  programmer  whose code combined RAM and ROM sections, and
     who wished to link only the ROM sections for input to a PROM
     burner.   The  RAM sections could subsequently be linked, as
     in the following example:

         / INPUT INFILE
         / DISABLE RAM
         / OUTFILE FILE1
         / GO
                                                          Page 12


         
           *** Pass Complete ***
         
         / DISABLE ROM
         / ENABLE RAM
         / OUTFILE FILE2
         / GO
         
           *** Pass Complete ***
         
         / EXIT
                                                     Page 13


3.0 PHASE II - PARAMETER ADJUSTMENTS

     After the MLINK user specifies all his files, he or she  may
then  optionally  type  a  series  of  commands to tell the Cross
Linkage Editor where and in what order the program  sections  may
be  loaded.   In  addition  to commands for modifying parameters,
commands exist to type out current parameter values.

     The commands used during this phase are described below:


PRINT section_name[,section_name,...]

     This command is used to print information about one or  more
     program  sections.  The command argument, "section_name", is
     a one to six character name of a program section which  must
     exist  in  at  least  one  of the modules which were read in
     during phase I.

     Example:
          /PRINT RAMSEC
          RAMSEC  R  E  Float  Base=100   Length=BC  Range=0:FFFF

          /

     The output includes the following:

     1- The name of the section being  printed,  RAMSEC  in  this
     case.

     2-  A  one-letter  code  indicating  the  type  of   section
     (A=Absolute, R=Relocatable).

     3- A one-letter code indicating whether or not  the  section
     is currently enabled (E=Enabled, D=Disabled).

     4- The current position  status  of  the  section.   "Fixed"
     indicates  the  section  has been requested for loading at a
     fixed absolute address with  a  BASE  command  (see  below).
     Absolute  sections  are  always  "Fixed" and cannot be moved
     under any circumstances.  "Float" indicates the  section  is
     relocatable  and currently "floats" in absolute memory.  The
     order of sections can be changed;  see the "ORDER"  command,
     below.

     5- The current base address of the section.

     6- The current length (in bytes) of the section.

     7- The range of  absolute  addresses  this  section  can  be
     located within.  A section should never be relocated outside
     this range of addresses.  Normal relocatable sections have a
     range  of  0 to 0FFFF to allow them to be placed anywhere in
     memory.  Page zero sections get a range of 0 to 0FF to limit
     them to page zero addresses.  If a section is placed so that
     any of its data is at addresses outside this range a warning
     is generated.

PRINT

     The PRINT command with no argument is similar to  the  PRINT
     command followed by a section name, except that it lists ALL
     program sections, in the order they  are  currently  loaded.
     This command can be used to aid the user in specifying ORDER
     and BASE commands.

     Example:
        /PRINT
        .ABS.   A  E  Fixed  Base=   0  Length=  10
        VARS    R  D  Float  Base=  10  Length=  4C  Range=0:FF
        .MAIN.  R  E  Fixed  Base= 100  Length= 108  Range=0:FFFF
        SUBS    R  E  Float  Base= 208  Length=  4C  Range=0:FFFF
        RAM     R  E  Fixed  Base=2000  Length= 10A  Range=0:FFFF
        
        /

     The output produced by this command  is  identical  to  that
     produced  by  the  PRINT command with arguments, except that
     several sections are listed.


UNDEFINED

     This command lists currently  unresolved  externals  on  the
     user's terminal.


DEFINE symbol-name = value

     This  command  allows  unresolved  external  symbols  to  be
     resolved at linkage time.  The specified symbol is given the
     specified value.

     Example:
          /DEFINE XXX=1000


ORDER section_name,section_name[,section_name,...]

     Initially, program sections are ordered by MLINK as follows:
     All absolute sections are loaded first into their respective
     absolute locations.   Relocatable  sections  are  placed  at
     floating  addresses such that they fit in the current holes.
     This floating of each relocatable section is limited to  the
     range of addresses the section is allowed to reside in.  

     The user may wish to change the order in which sections have
     been  loaded to fit the needs of the system being developed.
     This is the purpose of the ORDER command.  It  takes  as  an
     argument  a  list  of  section  names  in the order the user
     wishes to load them.  Normally, the user  will  specify  all
     program  sections in one ORDER command.  However, if several
     groups of sections are to  be  arranged,  each  starting  at
     different  physical  base  addresses, several ORDER commands
     may be used.   The  first  section  specified  in  an  ORDER
                                                          Page 15


     command may be a fixed section;  subsequent sections must be
     floating.  

     Example:
          /ORDER RAM1,RAM2

     This command ensures that section RAM1 will  be  immediately
     followed by RAM2.  

     The PRINT command (with no argument) is extremely useful  in
     aiding  users  of  the  ORDER  command,  since  it  displays
     sections in their currently-loaded order.


BASE section_name=address[,section_name=address,...]

     This command tells MLINK that section "section_name",  which
     must  be  a  relocatable  section,  is to be loaded at fixed
     address "address".  Initially, all relocatable sections  are
     loaded  at "floating" addresses (they immediately follow the
     sections loaded before them or are put  in  positions  where
     they will fit).

     The following command sequence might be used,  for  example,
     to logically group two sections of ROM code and two sections
     of RAM code, and then specify base addresses for  the  first
     section  of  each  type.   The  second  section of each type
     (i.e.,  RAM2  and  ROM2)  would   immediately   follow   its
     predecessor  at  a  floating  address,  since  no  BASE  was
     specified for it.

     Example:
          /ORDER RAM1,RAM2
          /ORDER ROM1,ROM2
          /BASE RAM1=0,ROM1=1000


FLOAT section_name[,section_name,...]

     This  command  informs  MLINK  that  the  named  section  or
     sections are to be "floated" in absolute memory as described
     earlier.  This is the initial condition for all  relocatable
     sections,  and  this  command  is  provided  to counteract a
     previously-given erroneous BASE command.

     Example:
          /FLOAT XYZ

     This command specifies that section XYZ is to be floated  in
     absolute memory instead of being fixed with a BASE command.
                                                          Page 16


4.0 MISCELLANEOUS COMMANDS

     MLINK has several additional commands which cannot easily be
classified as part of phase I or phase II.  They are:


EXIT

     This command causes MLINK to return to the operating  system
     and abort any current operation.

     Example:

          /EXIT

          .

HELP

     This command will print a short summary of commands, similar
     in content to Appendix A of this manual.


RADIX keyword

     Initially, numbers  typed  out  by  the  PRINT  command  are
     printed  in  hexadecimal  radix, and numbers typed in to the
     BASE command are assumed to be hexadecimal  as  well.   This
     may  be  changed  to  decimal (base 10) or octal (base 8) by
     using the RADIX command.  It takes one argument, a  keyword,
     which  is  either  "HEXADECIMAL"  for base 16, "DECIMAL" for
     base 10, or "OCTAL" for  base  8.   These  keywords  may  be
     abbreviated to one letter.

     Examples:
          /RADIX DECIMAL or RADIX D
          /RADIX H or HEXADECIMAL

     These two commands change the radix to decimal and  back  to
     hexadecimal,  respectively.   The  radix may be changed with
     this command as often as is desired.


RESET

     If the user has typed several commands to MLINK and  decides
     to  start  over  again,  he may type this command instead of
     exiting MLINK and re-executing the program.  It  essentially
     restarts  the MLINK program from the beginning, but does not
     reprint MLINK's sign-on message.  
                                                          Page 17


5.0 PHASE III - THE ACTUAL LINKAGE PROCESS

     Once the user is satisfied with the  parameters  set  during
phase II, he or she types the command "GO" to tell MLINK to begin
acting on the commands typed during phase I and phase II.  The GO
command has no arguments:

          /GO

     The "GO" command signifies the start of phase III, which  is
non-interactive.   The  Cross  Linkage  Editor  proceeds  to link
together the specified files, inform the user of any errors,  and
produce (if requested) map and/or output object file.  When done,
MLINK prints the message:

          * * * Pass Complete * * *

and reprompts for more commands.  At this point, MLINK is in  the
same  state  as  was  in just before the "GO" command.  All files
input during phase I  are  loaded  according  to  the  parameters
specified  in  phase  II.   The previously specified output file,
however, is closed.

     The user now has three options:

1.  He may type "EXIT" or Control/C and exit from MLINK.
2.  He may type "RESET" and then perform another linkage with
    new files.
3.  He may specify a new output filename (with the OUTPUT 
    command) and ENABLE or DISABLE various sections, then
    perform a linkage.
                                                          Page 18


6.0 INDIRECT COMMANDS

     A user of MLINK may frequently find himself linking the same
sequence  of  modules together to produce the same output file(s)
with the same set of parameters very frequently.  In  cases  like
this,  it  often  becomes  cumbersome  to  have  to type the same
sequence of commands over and over for each usage of the program.

     In order to make the process easier, MLINK supports indirect
(batch)  command files, which allow the user to put a sequence of
commonly-used MLINK commands in a file, which MLINK can then read
in lieu of terminal input at linkage time.

     A command file, which can be  created  and/or  edited  using
standard  system  editor  utilities,  may be executed by MLINK by
typing a command of the form

          /@filespec

     This causes the file named in "filespec" (which has in  this
case  a  default extension of ".CMD") to be read by MLINK and the
commands contained therein to be processed as if they  came  from
the  user's  terminal.   When the command file has been executed,
the user once again has control over MLINK,  and  may  type  more
commands  from  his terminal, if desired.  Indirect command files
may not currently be nested;  that is, no indirect  command  file
may contain an "@" command.
