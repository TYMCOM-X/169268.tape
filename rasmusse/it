Greg,

I need a special pricing request for a digital circuit and the
associated DSU/CSU units required for a digital circuit.

Bell of PA will provide the circuit to us, I'm just not
sure, nor can I find out, how this will be priced out on a
monthly basis.

The customer wants a 9.6 digital price and a 4.8 digital price.
Also, don't forget the installation charges, will they be
different?  Or will they still be the same?  This is
obviously not a competitive situation, but we have no way
of pricing digital circuits unless we go to special pricing.

Jim

      ===================================================================


      As you know, BT North America is now responsible for the sale of
      all BT products in North America.  As a result of this we will be
      required to handle an increasing number of large and complex
      contracts.  In order to handle those contracts in a professional
      and quality way, with accountability to the Corporation, I have
      decided to establish a Commercial Operations organization.  This
      organization will have the responsibility of making certain that
      all commercial dealings within the market place are carried out
      within consistant policies and guidelines which draw together the
      product offering, appropriate terms and conditions, competitive
      prices and committment of the company's resources.

      To achieve that goal, we will be drawing from various parts of our
      current organizations.  The responsibility of the new organization
      will be to manage BT's formal contractual relationship with the
      North American market and BT NA's relation with other parts of the
      global business by providing:

             o    terms, conditions and pricing that are standardized,
                  consistent, integrated, and synergistic

             o    special pricing that is responsive, competitive,
                  profitable, and consistent, upon request

             o    special bids and contracts that are responsive,
                  competitive, and profitable

             o    bid management procedures that are efficient, timely,
                  and competitive

             o    performance reviews for the company and for the
                  customer on special contracts

             o    financial analysis, control and forecasting that is
                  market-facing for revenues, finished goods, and
                  contract performance

















      Heading up the new organization of Commerical Operations will be
      Michael Charles, Vice President.  Reporting to Michael will be:

             Karen Slater, Director of Pricing and Contracts, with the
             responsibility for standard contractual offerings,
             standard/non-standard and strategic pricing.  Joining this
             organization will be Cami Ashton and the Contracts
             department;

             Rajni Desai, Director of Commercial Administration,
             responsible for revenue analysis, finished goods inventory
             management, and monthly financial reports and progress
             reviews;

             Tommy Arnett, Director, Bid Management, responsible for the
             bid/no bid review, bid management process, and non-standard
             contract negotiation and monitoring.  Tommy will continue to
             have responsibility for major bids and contracts, and Bid
             Management for the Asia Pacific Region coordinating with
             Jerry Stockbridge, Regional Director, Asia Pacific and John
             Poston, Sales Manager, Asia Pacific.  The group under Dave
             Gaetani providing the Bid Management functions for the sales
             organization will continue supporting sales in the
             identification of bid opportunities and will interface with
             the new commercial organization on major bids and continue to
             report to Mike Keilty;.

             Pat Driscoll, Director, Major Contract Management, with
             responsibility for working to support contract implementation
             through Customer Service and Support, Operations, and
             Development after bid award, to coordinate and schedule
             milestone events and to provide compliance review and
             business impact review for the organization.

      Additionally, to further build success in our BT North America
      organization and make use of the synergy between Business Planning,
      Business Development, Marketing and Products, I have decided to move
      some of the current responsibilities held by Michael Charles to Ron
      Bamberg in a new organization called "Products, Marketing and
      Business Planning".  Reporting to Ron in this organization will
      continue to be:

             Richard Gunther, Director of Strategic Planning;

             Jo An Couche, Director of Regulatory and Carrier Relations;

             David Jung and Nancy Jenks, Directors, Business Development,
             Application and Network;

             Tom Welch, Manager, Card Products.
















      The new groups reporting to Ron will be:

             Lana Vaysburd, Director, Network Products Management;

             Martha Hanlon, Director, Application and BT Product
             Management;

             Tom Santucci, Director, Marketing;

             Bob Barbour, Director, of Training and Documentation.

      Additionally, the Customer Support organization currently under
      Marketing and responsible for THUGS, ISIS, and customer
      demonstrations will be transferred to Corporate Communications and
      report to Judie Sassali.

      This restructuring is the next logical step in building cohesive
      working relationships between functions within the Company, all
      directed at responsiveness and service to the customer.

      Over the past year, Product Management and Marketing have taken
      great strides in this direction by creating a structured Product
      Management Process which allows orderly progression of product
      development to meet market requirements.

      A consolidated and coordinated Marketing/Sales Plan has been
      established, focused on identifying responsibilities and
      dependencies all leading to achieving this years revenue objectives.

      A Price Board, responsible for standardizing and simplifying our
      pricing while improving our competitiveness, has been established.
      World-wide price consistency is well on it's way to becoming a
      reality.

      Technical Training, working directly with Sales and CS&S, has
      restructured many of it's courses specifically designed to address
      the needs of those organizations.  This too is directed at
      increasing our competitiveness while providing knowledgeable, high
      quality service to our customers.

      I thank everyone for their efforts in making this coordinated
      activity a reality.  This is the kind of teamwork that is necessary
      to make BTNA the leader in our industry.

      I know you will support Michael and Ron in their new challenges.
      The focus remains on our customers.
