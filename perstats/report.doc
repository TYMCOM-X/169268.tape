                                ----------



             This documentation explains the different reports that
        can be generated using the MAGNUM ROTARY.PGRADE data base.
        The method of generating the reports is described, and a
        scenario for each procedure is presented to help in the
        understanding.





        Note : While running any procedure, if you are asked the
               question, " The last change to relation .... termina-
               ted abnormally........Do you want Magnum to attempt
               RELATION structure recovery? ",  enter "yes".

                        Report generated : AVGCON.HRS



        This procedure generates the report AVGCON.HRS which gives
        for all rotaries the average connect hours per business day
        during each of the five months specified by the user.  The
        information is sorted on port city.  Pilot number, node
        number, port type, and modem type are also given for each
        rotary in this report.

        When you are prompted to "ENTER 5 MONTHS FOR WHICH THE REPORT
        IS NEEDED.....", enter the five months you are interested in,
        in a chronological order.  If you don't, you will be informed
        that months are not entered in the right order, and prompted
        again for month names.



        When you are asked the question  'DO YOU WANT TO EXCLUDE
        ANY DAYS FROM PROCESSING ?', enter 'Y' if you want to
        exclude some days from average calculations.  In the above
        scenario, since 1st of April, 1983 is a holiday, it is being
        excluded from average calculations.  Similarly, more than one
        day can be excluded by entering them one by one in the format
        'YYMMDD'  at the colon prompt.  Hit carriage return at the
        prompt to stop the input.

                        Report generated  :  DAILY.INF



        DAILY.INFORMATION procedure creates the DAILY.INF report
        which contains the following information for each day during
        the specified period and for each specified rotary -
        Date, modem type, total number of ports on rotary, number of
        idle ports, total no. of sessions for the day, total no. of
        connect hours for the day, connect hours during the peak hour,
        percent of total traffic during the peak hour, and the pgrade.



        The following scenario shows how to run this procedure.

        -



        When the program asks you to  'ENTER FILE NAME OF ROTARIES....
        ..... ENTER ONE OF THE ABOVE',  you can enter 'ter' to input
        pilot numbers at the terminal.  Enter the pilot number at 
        the prompt, and hit carriage return.  Then you will be prompted
        for the next pilot number.  This way you can input as many
        numbers as you want, and can stop the input by entering an
        ampersand (&) for the pilot number.

        All rotaries in the data base can be considered for reporting
        by entering 'all' at the above prompt.

        If you have a file containing the pilot numbers of interest
        to you, you can specify the name of the file at this prompt.
        This is useful especially when you have a large number of
        pilot numbers to consider.  Each line in this file should
        contain a pilot number starting in column 1.  Only one
        pilot number is allowed per line.  The following paragraphs
        explain the creation of an Editor file.

                                                                Page 6


        EDITOR FILE CREATION ON SYSTEM 28
        ---------------------------------

        To use EDITOR, first log into System 28.  Once the login
        procedure is finished, some system related information is
        printed, and finally a dash appears at the left margin.  The
        dash (-) prompt indicates that you are now at the XEXEC 
        command level which gives you access to programs and languages
        on the system.


        EDITOR may be entered by using the CREATE or MODIFY command at
        XEXEC command level.  The CREATE command transfers control to
        EDITOR for the purpose of creating a new file.  For example,

        -CREATE MYFILE
        *

        transfers control to EDITOR so that you can start a new file
        called  MYFILE.


        The APPEND command allows you to enter lines of text into the
        EDITOR text area at the terminal.  A carriage return ends each
        line, which may contain any combination of characters.  With
        APPEND command you can enter an entire data file, editing as you
        type.

        The asterisk that indicates the EDITOR command level is not
        printed when you enter text.  To end text entry and return to
        the command level, type a control D (press the control key as
        you type D) at the beginning of a line.  An asterisk will be
        printed and you are back in the EDITOR command level.


        -CREATE MYFILE
        *APPEND
        408/980-8100
        415/966-8550
        919/737-2900
        503/436-2400
        *       (CTRL D WAS TYPED)


        To see what you entered, type a slash character (/) after the
        asterisk.  The slash command, which isn't ended by a carriage
        return, prints all the lines in the text area at the terminal.

                                                                Page 7


        Text entered into EDITOR is not permanently saved on a disk
        file until you request it to be with an EXIT  command.


        -CREATE MYFILE
        *APPEND
        408/980-8100
        415/966-8550
        *EXIT                    CTRL D ends text entry, and EXIT 
                                 updates the file

                         Report generated : GRAPHS.REP


        GRAPHS procedure generates a graphical report of pgrade for
        specified rotaries for sixty days from the ending date 
        specified by the user.  GRAPHS.REP also shows the necessary
        rotary information and other pgrade statistics like 5 day
        average, 22 day average, etc., along with a graphical 
        report for daily pgrade during the 60 days.

        When the program asks you to 'ENTER FILE NAME OF ROTARIES.....
        ..... ENTER ONE OF THE ABOVE', you can enter 'all' to consider
        all rotaries in the data base for reporting.  If you say 'ter',
        then you are prompted for the pilot phone number.  Enter a
        pilot number at the terminal and hit carriage return.  This
        way you can input all pilot numbers of interest to you.  Enter
        an ampersand (&) to stop inputting numbers.

        If the number of pilot phones you are interested in is large,
        then you can create a file with these pilot numbers, and just
        specify the file name at the above prompt.  This file should
        contain one pilot number per line and each line should be
        started out with a pilot number in column 1.  Read 'EDITOR FILE

        ...... ENTER ONE OF THE ABOVE ', you can enter 'all' to consider
        all rotaries in the data base for reporting.  If you say 'ter',
        then you are prompted for the pilot phone number.  Enter a 
        pilot number at the terminal and hit carriage return.  Then you
        will be prompted for the next pilot number.  This way you can
        input all pilot numbers of interest to you.  Enter an ampersand 
        (&) to stop inputting numbers.


        If the number of pilot phones you are interested in is large,
        then you can create a file with these pilot numbers, and just
        specify the file name at the above prompt.  This file should
        contain one pilot number per line and each line should be started
        out with a pilot number in column 1.  Read 'EDITOR FILE CREATION'
        under  DAILY.INFORMATION  procedure documentation to learn
        about creating files using EDITOR.

                       Report generated  :  SEMI.AVG



        This procedure creates the  SEMI.AVG  report.  For each rotary
   in the data base, this report gives the monthly average pgrade,
        averaged on business days, for the six months ending on the
        specified date.  The report also gives the pilot number, and
        the port city information for each rotary.

                       Report generated : UNUSED.PRT




        Everyday, when the ROTARY.PGRADE  data base is updated
        using the PORTS data base and daily traffic data base,
        the UNUSED.PORTS  procedure is also run automatically.
        This creates the UNUSED.PRT  report, which is written over
        every day.  UNUSED.PRT  report contains information
        about all public access ports in the network which have not
        been used for atleast 2 days from the day the report was
        generated.  It gives the Node number, port number, phone
        number and the number of days this port is unused.


        In order to pull out this report, follow the procedure given
        below.

        This procedure generates three reports, each containing the
        same data but sorted differently.  These reports contain
        NODE.CITY, NODE.STATE, NODE, PILOT.PHONE, PORT.CODE, PORT.TYPE,
        MODEM.TYPE, PORT.CITY, total number of ports on the rotary, 
        average number of ports unused, average CONNECT.HOURS, average
        CONNECT.HOURS per port, average SESSIONS, average PEAK.HOUR,
        average PEAK.PERCENT and average PGRADE.  All the averages 
        were figured for business days per month (weekends and holidays
        excluded)
