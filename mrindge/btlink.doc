BT Tymnet offers TYMLINK service from the United Kingdom through
an agreement with British Telecom UK.  TYMLINK is provided by means
of Dialplus, a service offered by PSS (BT's domestic network) which
allows the generic, reverse-charged access to Tymnet's TYMUSA Band 1 
menu server/gateway.  The following describe the process of making a 
call to a host service of your choice using TYMLINK.  
 
 
   1.  This service must be ordered through BT Tymnet unless
   the host has already ordered TYMUSA Band 1 service.  Once
   this has been established, proceed with steps 2 through 6.
 
   2.  Establish a telephone connection to a TYMLINK/Dialplus 
   network access point.  A list of network access points and 
   their associated telephone numbers follow these instructions.
 
   3.  No action is required to handshake with the PSS network.
   Once connection has been achieved, a banner welcoming you 
   to the Dialplus service will be displayed on your screen 
   together with a prompt for entry of your password.  Enter 
   TYMUSA [carriage return].    An asterisk [*] will be shown 
   for each password character you type. 
 
   4.  The call will be automatically routed to the Tymnet menu 
   server/gateway after the TYMUSA password (username) is 
   entered and verified.  You will see 'calling' and 'connected 
   to' messages followed by the familiar 'Please log in' from 
   TYMNET.
 
   5.  Enter your Tymnet domestic username and password.  The 
   call will be routed to the destination host.  The call will 
   be billed to the host at the TYMUSA Band 1 rate based on the 
   accounting data collected on the domestic portion of the call.
 
   6.  To disconnect, log off the host system as you normally 
   would from a domestic call.  The call will be cleared and
   disconnected by the PSS network.  Disconnection from Dialplus 
   will be confirmed by the message    'Thank you for using PSS 
   Dialplus'.
