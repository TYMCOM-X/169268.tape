            In today's world, much emphasis is placed on one
          particular aspect of a person's life, relationships.  We
          listen to and read the words of individuals all describing
          how to find, enjoy and keep deep and intimate relationships.
          Yet, despite all the words, we rarely, if ever, achieve the
          intimacy or longevity we all crave from relationships with
          others.  Most often, the fragilness of it is shattered,
          either through someone's actions or events outside our
          control.
            Yet, there is a relationship you need to be told of, one
          where the intimacy and permanency you long for is there for
          the asking, where the unconditional love we all crave is
          waiting, where the one who wants the relationship already
          knows you more intimately than you know yourself.  This
          relationship is with the Lord Jesus Christ.
            How intimately does he already know you?  According to the
          139th Psalm, he knows when you sit and when you stand.  He
          knows your thoughts from a distance.  He knows all your
          habits.  He knows what you will speak before you speak it.
          He stands in front of you and behind you.  He knows
          everything there is to know about you.
            How anxious is Jesus to enter into this relationship with
          you?  He says in Revelation 3:20 "Here I am.  I stand at the
          door and knock.  If anyone hears my voice and opens the
          door, I will come in and eat with him, and he with me".
            But does not he know about your past, those things we all
          hide from each other and try to from God?  Yes, but he knows
          we have all sinned against him, "For all have sinned and
          fallen short of the glory of God" (Rom 3:23).  Yet despite
          this, his love is so great, he committed himself to the
          point of giving his life so your sins may be forgiven, "for
          God showed his love for you, in that while you were yet a
          sinner, Christ died for you" (Rom 5:8).
            But doesn't God want to punish you for your crimes against
          him?  Not so!  He has said in John 3:17 that "the son of man
          came not into the world to condemn you, but that you may be
          saved thru him".
            Thru Jesus?  Is that how the relationship is entered into?
          Yes and it is the only way.  God, the creator and owner of
          all, in his last will and testament, the Bible, DECLARES HIS
          TERMS "neither is there salvation in any other name, for
          there is no other name (Jesus) under heaven among men
          whereby you must be saved" (Acts 4:12).
            Saved?  From what?  Hell, a place of eternal torment for
          those who reject God's declared way of salvation.
            Why is this so?  To be saved, that which separates God
          from you, your sin, must be dealt with first and that is
          thru his son "in whom we have redemption through his blood,
          the forgiveness of sins" (Acts 10:43).
            If you entered into this relationship, could you be sure
          of not going to Hell and is this relationship permanent?
          Yes for Jesus has declared if you "hear my words and believe
          in him who sent me HAS eternal life and will not be
          condemned" (John 5:24) and that John declares "these things
          were written that you MAY KNOW you have eternal life" 1 John
          5:13.
            So, what must you do to be saved?  First, tell God you our
                                                                  Page 2


          truly sorry, another words repent of your sins and tell him
          you want to do things his way, "repent and be converted
          (Acts 3:19)".  Second, just as a doctor gives you medicine
          for a virus in your body to cleanse you, you must ask God to
          cleanse your soul of the virus of sin by asking him to use
          the blood of Christ to "cleanse you from all
          unrighteousness" (1 John 1:8).  Lastly, receive Christ into
          your soul by asking him to come into your heart, "for as
          many as received him, to them he gave the power to become
          the sons of God, even to them who believe on his name" (John
          1:12).  You need to receive Jesus into you heart to seal the
          relationship, "in whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard
          the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, in whom
          also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy
          Spirit of promise (Eph 1:13)".
            If you have received Christ, you now have entered into a
          relationship where you have the right to look up to heaven
          toward God and shout "Abba, Father (Rom 8:15)" and you are
          now his heir with Christ (Rom 8:17).  If you have yet to
          take the step, please contact the church below and talk with
          us.  You are not promised tomorrow and forever is a very
          long time to be without God.
