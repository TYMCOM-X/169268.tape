               This memo is to restate my understanding of what was agreed
          to during the conference call on 8/19.  If you have any questions
          on areas of different understanding, please call me at
          408-922-8072.

            1) Fremont Operations will be responsible for first line
               troubleshooting when problems occur on RAM and Netval.  This
               will include contacting the appropriate persons who handle
               the product if Fremont is unable to resolve.

            2) Fremont Operations will contact Netcon if they are unable to
               contact the persons listed on their contact lists.  Netcon
               will page the STS on-call and have them contact Fremont
               Operations.

            3) Fremont Operations has the appropriate documentation to
               troubleshoot and contact lists available to them at this
               time.

            4) Netcon will reload the RAM and Netval code for the next few
               days from the Suns until Fremont Operations is trained on
               how to use Bits.

            5) A class is scheduled for 8/22 at 8:30 am to do the training
               mentioned in item 4 at which I will train on Bits.  Rick
               Daniels is scheduling who will attend.

                                             Thanks
