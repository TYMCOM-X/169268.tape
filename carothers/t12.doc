          Robert:

               This is the information you requested in response to Don's
          inquiry.


       1) These are the totals I have on record for the months of
          2/93-4/93.  The total number of hits were obtained off the
          Backbone logs thru the NMS system.  A record kept of scheduled
          outages and tickets allows the determintation of which outages
          are scheduled and how many total tickets were opened.

                    Total Tkts.   * of Hits   Unsched. Hits   Sched. Hits

          Feb           35             72           52             20
          Mar           23             49           33             16
          April         28            140           48             92

       2) Listed below are samples of the statistics pulled off the NMS
          each month for each trunk.  It is from these numbers that the
          total outages and total time of outages are calculated.

          the total outage time for n40n130 is 3 mins

       3) When a T-1 outage occurs, The NMS "Network Display" will show the
          T-1 hit/outage and the "Network Alarm" window will display all
          error message pertaining to the hit/outage, such as frame losses,
          link down, etc...

          The NMS will not display congestion messages on the Backbone or
          port reconnect failures, both due to lack of bandwidth when a T-1
          is down.  These messages can only be seen by technicians querying
          the "network events" or the "events" on an individual node.
          Reconnection can only take place when the down T-1 comes back up
          or bandwidth is reassigned by the technician, with the probable
                                                                     Page 2


          result of another port dropping.

       4) A customer using the TMCS tool will see any zapper resulting rom
          a T-1 drop along with any associated outages, such as the lack of
          bandwidth to reestablish a circuit or an hard outages resulting
          from equipment failure, including power outages.  A customer such
          as Motorola will not know if a T-1 dropped, site loss power or
          whatever unless the cause for the zapper is verified with Netcon
          thru CS*S.

       5) In regards to an action plan, GMP*Atlanta is in the process of
          enhancing the Backbone capabilities.  i suggest that a full
          understanding and schedule of these plans be obtained by
          management in order to answer Motorola's action plan request.  

               If there are any further questions, please let me know.


                                        Thanks

                                            Steve
