          This year was a mixed bag.  CEIC was an excellent experience.  I
     was allowed to structure a network operations from the beginning and
     daily on-site contact with a customer greatly opened my understanding
     of a customers's needs, desires and how to work with them
     successfully.  My performance on this project was excellent.  Both
     Lidia Beer and David Kingsland indicated it would be their "honor" to
     recommend me in the future.  I would like very much to work on other
     long term overseas projects.

          Other areas of my job performance were unsatisfying to me.  I was
     assigned mostly administrative tasks with little diversity for growth.
     My growth in handling new and diverse situations on the GNS was
     inhibited by my travels by CEIC and the swingshift supervisor
     constantly working dayshift, therefore reducing my opportunities to
     handle situations.  I believe I was under utilized.
