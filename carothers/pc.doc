          ===============================================================


               Since my return from Canada, there has not been a time
          when I have entered the NCC when there was not a least on of
          the pc programs has not be functioning normally.  Usually the
          program(s) is in a hung state and has been so for a
          substantial period of time before any corrective action is
          taken.  Tymwatch and Abits are the worst offenders.
