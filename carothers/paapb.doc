                       ------------------------------------------


               This appendix contains Primary Access hardware
          configurations for each box in the Global Network.  The
          configurations are listed by city/site in alphabetical order.
          Each site is divided into two charts, one which gives an overview
          of the whole site and one which gives specific hardware slot
          information on each box.

               The first chart, the Primary Access Configuration Summary,
          gives an overview look of a site and the boxes located on it.
          The overview looks includes

           - Pertinent site information.

           - Primary Access box access port id which allows user access
             into box from the global network.

           - T-1 ID used to designate a T-1 and the hardware slots
             associateed with it on a particular box.

           - Telco T-1 circuit id.

           - Megacom 800 number assigned to T-1 for dial access.

           - Baud rate designated on consat.

           - Tymnet node number, kernal host number and consat port id
             associate with T-1 and it assigned DSP cards.

           - DSP hardware slots assigned to specified T-1.

               The second chart, the Primary Access Hardware Slot
          Configuration, is a chart which give specific information about
          each box on a per hardware slot basis and identifies the port by
          port connections to a Tymnet node/host/port .  The chart
          specifies

           - Card type which identifies the card type in a hardware slot.

           - T-1 id identifies which T-1 a DSP card is s/w assigned to.

           - Below each shelf is listed the T-1 ID's , the megacom number
             assigned to it and the consat node/host number.

           - DDT port identifies which consat port is assigned to a DSP
             card's port.

               From the information provided, a user should be able to
          indentify the path a dialing in user takes into the T-1 and into
          the Tymnet equipment.  In the example following, if the user
          looks at slot 13 on the box, they should be able to identify that

           - The megacom number the user dialed up is 800-222-0555.
                                                                     Page 2


           - The T-1 the user dials thru is identified as t1 "1A" and it's
             circuit id is DHEC675700.

           - The T-1 goes to a DSP2 card.

           - The DSP2 card is hardwired to ports 30 and 31 on Tymnet node
             11151.
