          Topic:  Worst Link Responsibilities         Date: 28/3/91

          ================================================================



               One of the ways in which Global Network Control maintains
          quality of service is by the use of the WORST LINKS list.  This
          list is generated once a week and is a listing of the worst
          performing links over the last week on the TGN.  Each NMC is now
          required to persue these outages in the following manner:

            1) On Wednesdays Pacific Coast Time, Global Network Control in
               San Jose, Ca.  will pull a list of the worst links on the
               TGN over the previous week.  San Jose will open tickets and
               send to the appropriate NMC.  Each NMC should then persue
               these tickets as normal faults.

            2) On Tuesday of each week, each NMC should sent a dialcom
               listing their open tickets with their status/resolution.
               The dialcom should be sent to Steven Carothers, Mel
               Pangilinan, Dan Brown and Lon Orona.

               If there are any questions, please contact me at this
          dialcom user.
