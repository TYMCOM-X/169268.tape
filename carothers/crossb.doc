          This is my final report for Operation Crossbow.  In it, I would
     like to briefly outline the major areas of accomplishment during my
     time in England and business left unfinished.  Fred Evans and myself
     are discussing recomendations and will submit a joint document to you
     shortly.

  I. ACCOMPLISHMENTS
     ---------------

          The major catagories of accomplishment may be summed up as
     follows:

     1) Password Security - A method was established to allow secure
        distribution of passwords between San Jose, UKOPS and Tenter.
        Coordination also occurred between Fred Evans and myself to
        establish French procedures and Christine Greenhalgh and myself to
        help her establish appropriate distribution procedures to her cs's.
        The method included the setting up of distribution list indicating
        who was to receive which passwords and where to contact them, the
        proper method of exchanging passwords and the correct methods for
        keeping passwords secure.

     2) Training - The expertise of the Luton personnel was very good and I
        needed only to fill in any gaps that appeared.  This allowed me to
        focus my attention on the training of new personnel.

             An overview class was designed consisting of the configuration
        of the public network, it's relationship to the UKNET, how ISIS
        worked, the use of n/w utilities and the use of operating systems
        such as UNIX.  I gave the first 2 classes and had Peter Townsend
        give the last two so there would be someone familiar with the
        course to teach it after I was gone.  Sean gave a shorter version
        of the h/w class he gave to the cs's as a intermediate step to the
        Baynard people until they could all attend TTT h/w courses.

             There were a few things in progress when I left.  First,
        Claire Steadman was assigned the task of putting together a
        troubleshooting class on how to handle daily problems and how to
        resolve.  Also, the Baynard techs were being cycled thru TTT
        courses for h/w and will hopefully get the others in the fall.

     3) UKOPS Site Move - Location of UKOPS was transferred from Luton to
        Baynard.  My participation included advising on the Baynard
        equipment configuration, planning of the move and doing the actual
        move and hookups at the new site.  We accomplished this task 6
        weeks ahead of the original due date by request.

     4) UKNET Supervisor Statistics - TGN program used to gather data on
        how hard a supervisor worked while active was revised for UKNET's
        needs.  This will allow UKOPS to build a longterm database and have
        some idea how hard the UKNET supervisors work over a long period of
        time.

     5) Bridge Between Groups - Another goal was to be a "bridge" between
        the various groups, both in the UK and overseas.  This was
        accomplished in several ways.

             First, the relationship between San Jose and the various other
        territorial NMC's was defined and how the quality performance of
        the network would be maintained.  Defined was who would be the
        primary party responsible in the case of a line or node outage and
        what timeframes would be used before the secondary party would take
        action.  Defined was how each group would relate to San Jose for
        projects.  Also defined were such things as weekly Worst Link
        Reports which each group is to send to San Jose so that chronic
        problems could be persued properly and each NMC provide monthly
        updates of escalation chains.

             Second, coordination took place between Fred Evans and myself.
        This included making sure NMC procedures coincided as closely as
        was reasonable and weekly phone conversations between us to keep
        each other abreast of what was going on in each others groups.

             Thirdly, I acted as a bridge between UKOPS and the various
        other groups I came into contact with.  This task involved stepping
        in when the states were slow in response to inquiry or problems,
        such as with validations, offering alternate methods of doing
        tasks, keeping the Global Network Manager informed on a weekly
        basis and selected UK managers of what was happening, providing
        miscellaneous services, such as lists of who handled what in the
        states, and pointing out problem areas, such as the UKNET
        supervisors configuration problems.

             Lastly, I have accumulated a working knowledge of how Europe
        works and will be able to advise both sides of the Atlantic in how
        to coexist effectively.

     6) Documentation and Procedures - Review of all documentation and
        procedures took place as a group at periodic meetings and by myself
        individually.  As a whole, the manuals were pretty well up-to-date,
        but their procedures were either not written down or written down
        in abreviated form so that you needed experience with the product
        to use them.  The response was to define what was needed, define
        who would get or write the document/procedure and define due dates
        for each.  The results were as follows.

             For my part, I provided up-to-date manuals where needed and
        wrote documents such as how to troubleshoot, rebuild and provide
        data integrity for TMCS and for the ticket system to guide the tech
        in how to persue faults, such as what severity to use, when to
        escalate, etc..  to go along with the existing document which
        demonstrates how to used the various commands.  Also, from the
        meetings, I decided to add documentation to the overview class for
        various utilities and operation systems and created scripts files
        with actual examples altered and labeled for easy reading and
        reference use.

             Several crucial things were also established.  First, a
        person, Peter Townsend, was offically assigned to make sure
        everything is documented and put into their procedure binders.
        Second, they are getting more into the habit of documenting more
        information more often and not using notes in their logbooks.
        Lastly, all documents available were reviewed during the meetings
        and it gave them a much better handle on what they needed.  As of
        this writing, I do not know where they currently stand.  I do know
        that, for the most part, they were reaching their due dates before
        the Luton-Baynard move and were falling behind afterwards.


 II. UNFINISHED
     ----------

          The following are the major unfinished areas :

     1) PC Programs - The goal was to set up 3 pc programs on the UKNET.
        These were Netmon, which would monitor and report validations
        problems occurring, Tymwatch, which would continueously check all
        the node-to-node connections for problems and Supwatch, which would
        graph the hourly load on the network and build a longterm database
        so they could understand better and measure peak use hours.

             At last status, they were still being caught up in
        import/export problems or in revision.  I am working with Fred and
        Theresa Lai (Netcon programmer) to get this programs up as soon as
        possible.

     2) Projects - The goal was to have procedures in place for the
        coordination between UKOPS and San Jose.  These procedures were to
        define how San Jose would receive copies of all UK projects, who
        would request shuts, who would do loads and how San Jose would
        report the results of projects to San Jose.

             Currently, Jolee is working on the project flow and assigning
        who is responsible for what elements of it.  There is a procedure
        in place for UKOPS requesting shuts and load of nodes.  There is
        nothing in place for San Jose to receive copies of projects, nor is
        there as of yet agreement between PI and UK on what form the
        projects from Uk to PI are to take.  Nor is there final agreement
        on how UKOPS will report project status to San Jose.  Once Jolee
        has more established procedures with PI's agreement, the NMC's
        procedures can be completed.

     3) Training - As indicated under accomplishments, much was done for
        training.  One critical item, however, was not accomplished, that
        being the rotation of Baynard techs to Luton for hands on Tymnet
        experience prior to the NMC transfer.  The result of this is that
        there is not sufficent personnel to run the Tymnet side or to give
        hands on training to Baynard personnel in a effective manner.  The
        reason for this was management having to deal with sensitive unions
        at Baynard and having to take a go slow approach with them.

          Once again, thank you very much for the opportunity you provided
     me.  If you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call.
