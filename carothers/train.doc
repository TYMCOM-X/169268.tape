               During my time with the CEIC project, several items were
          accomplished.  I would like to touch on them briefly.

               First, acceptance testing was done and went well despite
          Fred Evan's departure.

               Second, training was done, with the thrust being familiarize
          persons with their new daily responsibilities, how they should be
          accomplished, review the tools and utilities to be used and
          extensive hands on.  The following is a list of the material
          covered and any recommendations for further training.

          1) Procedures for the beginning of the shift were accomplished.
             These involved checking the status of all utility hosts on the
             network, the supervisor statuses, status of RAM and NETVAL,
             logging all pertinent information into the center logbook and
             logging in all pc's and windows to monitor preselected items.

          2) Personnel were shown how to change and restart RAM tape when
             RAM is paused due to tape being completed.

          3) Techs shown how to check Netval status and the status of the
             consistency.

          4) Diagnostic tools Xray, TMCS, DDT and Probe were reviewed.
             Review included most commonly used command and pertinent
             information to draw from these commands.  Documentation was
             also given listing all these common commands with their
             definition and on-line hardcopy.

          5) CDM was reviewed.  This involved use of all icons and keeping
             config database and netmap information in sync.

          6) CMF was used for looking up of code and loading of both nodes
             and slots.

          7) Tymfile configurations were used in conjunction with different
             tools to demonstrate how data seen using utilities sprout from
             configurations within tymfiles.

          8) Manipulation of the workstation was review along with basic
             Unix commands.  A list of the most commonly used Unix commands
             was provided with definitions and sample output.

          9) My recommendations for basic training are as follows:
           - Techs should attend NTI courses 501,502,503 for basic Tymnet
             technology.  Most have already done so or are scheduled.
             Bruce Stewart has provided me with a schedule for attendance.
           - All persons should attend CDM class.  Most already have.
           - All persons should attend a Service Desk class if the service
             is accepted.
           - All persons should attend ISIS and Turbo classes.
           - Technicians should develop and write as much of their own
             procedures/documentation as feasible, which has been
             initiated, to drive their interest in the technology as well
             as develop their expertise.

               Thirdly, a series of meetings was begun with control center
          staff.  The purpose of these meetings were to begin to define
          what operations needs to begin function and assign action items
          to specific persons to accomplish them.

               Lastly, I have put together a summary of my thoughts on what
          the control center should do to get started properly.  This memo
          has many items off the outline I provided for the first meeting
          in item three, which contained procedures and other items to be
          persued, but places more meat on it to guide them at the
          beginning as they take over the day-to-day tasks in the control
          center.
