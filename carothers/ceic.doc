          ==================================================================


               There are many issues that CEIC Network Control will need to
          address when deciding how they will operate their control center.
          These issues range from what to monitor, to how is it to be
          monitored, to how it is to be persued, to how will all this be
          done if the primary control center is down.  What follows was
          gathered together to help quide the control center personnel in
          the basic areas of what they need to get started.  This
          information should be used in conjunction with the weekly
          meetings just begun to address these areas, as well as any others
          which arise, and to push any action item forward.

               Various procedures will need to be developed in regards to
          how problems will be tracked, how high a priority will be set,
          escalations and any additional troubleshooting special
          circumstances may require.

          1) Problem priority, tracking and escalations - Different types
             of problems will have different impacts on the network and
             different users.  A listing of what priority each of these
             problems will have needs to be written.  I advise any node
             outage, problem with a network utility, host outage or
             backbone line problem should be considered priority one, any
             parially disabled slot or non-backbone line priority two and
             all other problem priorities be set as the customer sees
             appropriate.

                  Each priority should have a predetermined timetable as to
             when it should be statused and escalated.  This may already be
             written into the field service contract.  If not, I advise as
             general rules that any priority one should be statused every
             two hours and escalated every four hours, priority two
             problems statused every four hours and escalated every eight
             hours and all other be defined and written into the
             procedures.

                  It is also important that proper escalation lists be kept
             in the control center and current.  The control center
             supervisor should handle this responsiblity.  These lists
             should contain the escalation ladders for the management of
             Network Control, the phone companies and field service.

          2) Chronic Problems - Problems may reoccur over a period of time
             on a specific element of the network indicating a problem may
             not be getting resolved.  A definition of what should be
             considered a chronic problem, a problem that continually
             reoccurs, should be decided upon to trigger predetermined
             actions.  For now, a problem reoccurring 3 times over a 30 day
             period would be a good starting point for considering a
             problem chronic.



                  Once the definition of a chronic is decided upon, any
             special procedures to be done should be defined.  At this
             point, the amount of non-chronic troubleshooting has not been
             decided upon for the control center, let alone chronic, so
             most of this type of troubleshooting will be done by the
             technical support.  Any chronic problem will have the full
             range of problem solving done to it and the control center
             should have an idea of what is involved with them.  For nodes,
             a full memory dump should be performed followed by the
             designated technical group analizing the dump and the field
             engineer performing all diagnostics requested by the technical
             person.  For lines, a technical person should review the line
             performance with test being run based on the analysis.  For a
             host, all analysis outside of slot dumps should be done by the
             technical person.

                  Lastly, to prevent chronics, it is recommended that the
             control center track, on a weekly basis, repeat problems on
             the network.  A person should be designated to do this task.
             This information can be taken from CDM and Service Desk and
             procedures should be in place as to how to do this.

          3) Procedures for tracking AR's - Network Control will need to
             decide upon how open outage ar's will be tracked.  This would
             include who will open, status, defer, escalate and close AR's.

                  There are two basic systems to handle this.  The first
             would be for each person to handle all AR's pertaining to
             their positions responsibilities.  For example, if a person
             was responsible for all node and host outages on their shift,
             they would be responsible for all AR's pertaining to these
             also.  The second method would be to have one person handle
             all existing AR's, including making sure they are statused and
             handling escalations, while the other shift person's handle
             any network problems which the see on their monitor tools or
             phone calls received.  I recommend the second at this time
             until a better feel is developed for how many calls will be
             coming in and how the network will be working and a procedure
             defined indicating these divisions.


          DATABASE INTEGRITY
          ------------------

               There are several utilities and programs which operations
          will be using which will require either manual modification,
          backing up to tape, or both for their databases.  The following
          are what programs and utilities will need attention and
          recommendations to insure integrity of on-line data and recovery
          from tape if/when the need arises.

          1) TMCS - As modifications are made to the network configuration,
             TMCS will need to be updated on it's profiles, limits and
             node/host names.  These items will affect what the utility
             does or does not see at a particular time on a particular
             monitor/screen.



                  In order to keep TMCS current, it is recommended that a
             logbook/binder be kept.  It should contain (1) hardcopy of all
             profiles, (2) hardcopy of all limits, (3) listing of all
             network configuration changes (installs/deinstalls) and (4) a
             list of all ignores, that is elements on the network that TMCS
             will track, but the user has told it not to, with the reason
             for the ignore.  This information will allow the user to make
             changes on TMCS in an ongoing and orderly manner and make
             available the information needed to rebuild individual
             elements of TMCS as required.

                  TMCS disk should also be stored to tape on a regular
             basis.  The store will allow the recovery of all disk
             information from tape if the need arises.  Individual items,
             such as a profile, cannot be restored separately.  The
             customer will need to decide how often to do a store, one a
             week being recommended, how many copies of a store to do and
             how long to hold onto the copies.

          2) CDM - As with TMCS, CDM will also be used to monitor network
             problems.  It is therefore equally important that it's
             configuration be kept current.  This can be done in
             conjunction with the TMCS updates.  It is important to
             remember that Netmap and the CIS configuration must be
             identical, so any changes in one must coincide with changes in
             the other.

                  As with TMCS, CDM should be backed up to tape on a
             regular basis.  The customer will need to decide how often and
             how long a tape(s) should be kept.  It is recommended that it
             be done at least when the TMCS stores are done.

                  Lastly, the Belleville and Montreal sites will need to be
             updated with configuration changes to allow them to monitor
             the network when the primary control center is unavailable.  A
             procedure for keeping these sites current will be required.

          3) Service Desk - This program will require both updating of
             databases with new configurations and backup to tape.  It will
             need to be decided how often to back-up and how long to hold
             onto the tapes.  It is recommend that a back-up be done in
             conjunction with backing up TMCS and CDM.

          4) Netval - This is the utility which contains network
             information pertaining to usernames, passwords, type of
             network access, etc...  A procedure requiring a daily store of
             the information is recommended.  The customer will need to
             decide how long they wish to keep these tapes, but a minumum
             of a week is recommended.

               It is always important that everyone know how to do all
          tasks.  However, I feel, especially at the beginning, that a
          specific person(s) be assigned to handle these tasks, at least at
          the beginning, and then others brought into the loop later.



          DISASTER RECOVERY PLAN
          ----------------------

               Every center should have a plan in place in the case of a
          disaster at the site, such as a power outage.  A plan of this
          nature should have the basic elements of how other sites are to
          be contacted, what responsibilities are to be handed off to whom
          and how is down center to be brought back up.  It is recommended
          to fulfill these requirement that any plan include the
          recommendations listed below.

          1) Communication between sites - A method of communication must
             be established in advance that allows communication outside of
             a down site.  The two easiest methods are either an especially
             established line in the building that can be used at such a
             time or a portable phone that runs on a battery.

          2) When to transfer - It must be defined in advance under what
             circumstances site responsibilities will be transferred.  A
             contrast must be established for transfer between a site
             outage, when all power is out for whatever reason, and and the
             continueal dropping and regaining of power which would make
             the performance of network monitoring tasks extremely
             difficult.  The latter should be specific in defining how many
             drops within a specified timeframe would qualify.

          3) What responsibilities are to be transferred to which location
             - This portion of the plan will depend upon if there is a
             primary site with backups or all sites share the primary
             reponsiblities.  Any procedure should include (1) who will
             monitor the nodes, lines and hosts, (2) who will monitor the
             supervisors and (3) who will monitor the network utilities.
             These functions are usually split between different locations.
             For CEIC, I suggest all responsibilities be transferred to a
             single site with that site notifying any other site.

          4) Notifying management - It should be defined how management is
             to be notified and who in management is to be notified when
             either a site has been affected, reponsibilities have been
             transferred or both.  It is recommended that sites notify
             their own management in the prescribed fashion.

          5) Bringing the site back up - A method must be defined as to how
             the center is to be brought back on-line in an orderly manner.

                  First, it must be defined when a site will be considered
             stable.  Criteria should be set for both power outage and
             power hit, with timeframes for stable power being defined
             clearly for both.

                  Second, once a site is considered stable, the order in
             which nodes are to be reloaded should be established in
             advance.  This would usually be the main site switchers first
             followed by the other site nodes.  Emphasis should be put on
             bringing up the nodes network control rely on as quickly as
             possible.



                  Third, it should be defined who will reload the nodes.
             This is usually done by one of the alternate sites.  Load
             strings should be kept current and available on hardcopy for
             reloads.

                  Lastly, it must be defined when control can be retaken by
             the network control.


          LOGBOOK
          -------

               The center logbook will be used to record events taking
          place within the control center.  It is advised that the
          following information be used as a starting point in deciding
          what should go into CEIC`s logbook:

          - Start of shift information, including status of utilities,
            status of supervisors and status of accounting blocks
          - Shut/unshut of node or link
          - Status change in any hosde or link
          - Power outage, including when they occurred, when power was
            restored and time the last node was up
          - Any problem occurring on any utility
          - Supervisor swaps and problems
          - Any supervisor problems and swaps
          - Scheduled network events
          - Any reloads, including indication of what whas loaded and with
            what code
          - Any pages done to individuals or groups
          - Any network circuit zappers of a defined size


          PASSWORD DISTRIBUTION
          ---------------------

               Recommendations have been made under the section titled
          "Users" stating recommendations as to some of the users the
          control center will need.  There are also general use users, such
          as xray and oddjob, whose passwords need to be changed
          periodically and distributed.  A method will need to be
          established for this distribution.

               It is best to limit the amount of site to site and
          department to department back and forth due to passwords for
          security reasons.  It is suggested that distribution be handled
          in the following manner if the control center will have
          distribution responsibility:

          - Network Control should have a list of contacts for each site
            and department which need to be notified of contact changes.
          - The "Contact List" should contain each designated person to
            receive passwords and which passwords should be received.
          - An appropriate method for identification should be established,
            such as calling a caller back at predetermined phone number or
            using employee id numbers.
          - Each individual site and department should have established a



            distribution list and procedure so they may distribute
            passwords they receive to their personnel.
          - It is suggested that once a designated person has called in
            from a department or site, everyone, including any other
            designated contact, should have to contact their
            site/department designated person who has the new password.
          - No passwords should be sent thru any electronic mail system or
            kept in an on-line system that could be compromised.

               Being a 24 hour operation, I suggest Network Control be the
          contact point for the passwords.  Besides being 24 hours, they by
          definition will be dealing with more persons and, therefore, be
          more alert to any violations in persons trying to obtain
          passwords.


          SHIFT TURNOVER
          --------------

               Steps for shift turnover should be well defined.  They
          should include what is to be verified at that time, how it is to
          be verified and where the information obtained is to be kept.

               First, the following information is recommended to be
          verified at the start of every shift:
          - Status of all n/w utilities hosts using probe snaps
          - Status of RAM, running or paused, using the "stat" command
          - Status of Netval using the "disp rep" command.  It should be
            verified that is is up and running and that the last
            consistency run completed successfully.
          - Status of all supervisors
          - Status of accounting blocks on supervisors
          - Status of Netmap, including confirmation that changes makde to
            TMCS due to network configuration changes are also reflected
            correctly on Netmap.
          - Indication of any serious or other type of outages currently on
            network that special note needs to be made of
          - Verify superclock times are approximately the same on all
            supervisors
          - Any other items CEIC deems important

               Next, it is advised that a turnover form be constructed
          listing all the items above, with the person doing an item check
          initialing that item on the form as checked and the supervisor or
          designated person signing off on the whole sheet indicating all
          checks were done and understood.

               Lastly, it is advised to have hardcopy of intial hosts
          snaps, accounting block checks and supervisors tatus checks done
          in probe be placed somewhere for easy reference.  Either in the
          center logbook or on the shift turnover form is recommended.



          SUPERVISORS
          -----------

               The handling of the network supervisors will be of primary
          concern.  Several procedures should be designed and put into
          place as soon as possible.

               First, it should be decided how often the supervisors are to
          be swapped as well as at what time.  CEIC will not need to do one
          every day, but it is advised to do one periodically, every 3rd
          day would be fine, which would allow verification that all
          supervisors are functioning normally.  It is also advised that
          any scheduled swaps be done at a time when minimum traffic is on
          the network, so that if a problem is discovered on the new active
          supervisor, it would affect the fewest amount of users.

               Second, a procedure should be designed indicating the steps
          to be taken to do a supervisor swap.  The minumum commands that
          should be done are the "sys" command, to verify the supervisor
          logged into, and the "rtime" command, to verify that the
          superclock times are approximately the same on the supervisors.

               Third, a procedure should be in place indicating how the
          superclock times should be changed on the supervisors.

               Fourth, current load string should always be available for
          all supervisors.

               Fifth, procedures should be developed indicating how various
          supervisor problems will be handled.  For the present, all
          problems should be turned over to the designated technical
          support person.  However, problem procedure should be developed
          including how to handle
          - Disk errors
          - Kernel crashes
          - Low exec loops
          - Reloading of the kernel
          - Supervisor crash during swap


          USERS
          -----

               Users will need to be provided for both general center use
          and for the individual technicians use.  They are as follows:

          1) Each center should have a general network user to allow logins
             to the network utilities such as NETVAL, RAM and TMCS.  Having
             each center with their own user will keep the password secure
             and the centers seperate.

          2) Probe - Each center should have their own general secondary
             login name with the maximum license allowed the center.  The
             maximum license will be determined by the defined
             responsibilities.  This user would be used for for the general
             windows/screens logged into by the control center at all times
             and the screens used for such tasks as supervisor swaps.  Any



             primary center should have at minumum license 35 while and
             anyone else should start with license 20 and justify any
             increase.

                  Each technician at a primary control center should be
             given their own individual probe user with the same license as
             the general user.  This will allow tracking of tasks/commands
             used by each technician during the day using the "spy" command
             and limiting the license on individuals if so desired.

          3) TMCS - Each center should have their own profile user names,
             as they currently do, with limited license.  This license
             should start with "poo p01 p20 who inact oper hst grt".  A
             user should be established to be used for setting up profiles,
             updating node/host names and other tasks necessary to keep
             TMCS current (see Database Integrity).  The user for the
             primary center could be assigned this license.

          4) CDM - A general user has been established for login to the
             workstations.  It is recommened that each individual
             technician also have their own log in name for CDM/Unix.  This
             will allow each individual use of their own personel user as
             they see fit as well as allow the use of the "mail" system in
             Unix.

          5) CMF - A user should be established for general center use.
             Each person who is to use CMF should also have their own user.
             This is very important during only one person can be logged
             into any single at a time.

          6) Service Desk - A user should be established for general center
             use.  Each person using the utility should also have their own
             login user for use.
