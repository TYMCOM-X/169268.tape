       I.  Username Assignment

               Every group which uses Primary Access will have one or more
          usernames assigned to them depending on their individual needs.
          These names and licenses are determined and administered by the
          designated persons in Global Network Control and NTS.

               A current list of Primary Access usernames and passwords is
          kept with these designated persons.

      II.  Duplicate Usernames

               Certain groups will have duplicate usernames.  These
          usernames will be indentical in both name and password except for
          one trait, namely one will have all uppercase lettering and the
          other all lowercase lettering.  For example, user John Doe, if
          assigned duplicate users may have username 'JOHND" with password
          "ABC" and another named "johnd" with a password of "abc".  The
          purpose for this is to assign different licensing to each so that
          when login occurs, Primary Access logs may or may not be uploaded
          to Primary View at that time, depending on the situation and/or
          user preference.

               Having the ability not to have log files uploaded to Primary
          View upon login is important.  When a upload occurs, the pc is
          locked into the process and nothing else may be performed.  If a
          user needed to do immediate troubleshooting or perform a quick
          task, not having to wait many minutes for uploading of logs may
          be very useful.  A user may also have limited amounts of disk
          space to upload log files, especially laptops, and may mot wish
          to upload in order to maintain adequate disk space on their pc.
