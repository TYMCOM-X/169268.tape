          Dear Pastor Stewart:

               We have discussed on several occasions are mutual
          desire for Community to train and develop the abilities of
          members of our church to reach memebers of the major cults.
          We both understand the importance and need to defend and
          present the gospel to those people who are literally going
          to hell with bibles in their hands.  In these talks, we have
          discussed of beginning the process with a class to be
          presented at Community.

               My desire to see this class take place has grown
          stronger recently as I have been dealing with the Mormon
          missionaries assigned to our area.  I strongly desire to
          give the class myself, but if there is someone at Community
          who is more capable, that is fine.  The important thing is
          that it is done.  I would like to take this moment to
          briefly outline my thoughts on what form such a class should
          take and what it's final accomplishments should be.

               The class should be part of the regularly offered
          Sunday morning classes.  It should cover the following
          cults:

            - Jehovah Witnesses
            - Mormons
            - Catholics
            - one cult class desires also more information on

               In teaching these cults, thier basic history along with
          their beliefs in the following areas should be covered.

            - Doctrine of God
            - Doctrine of Jesus
            - Doctrine of Salvation, with emphasis on baptism
            - Doctrines of heaven and hell

               In the class materials and manner of presentation would
          include

            - video tapes
            - copies of documentation from the various cults and the
          organizations that deal with them
            - overhead and white board use
                                                                  Page 2


               The materials and argumentation presented will be
          intended not only to allow a person to deal with the
          individual cult, but give them a better footing as to why
          the doctrines of the church are true, thus at the same time
          enhancing their only individual knowledge of the scriptures.
