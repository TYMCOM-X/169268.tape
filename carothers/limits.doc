                      ***********************************
                      * REBUILDING NETCON'S TMCS LIMITS *
                      ***********************************



               The following procedures are for the rebuilding of
          destroyed limits on the TMCS hosts.  This is only to be used
          if the same limit on the alternate TMCS hosts are also
          destroyed.

            1) In Network Control where the diskettes are kept is a
               diskette labelled LIMITS AND PROFILES / MASTER.  Place
               this in a pc and access the A drive with the command A:

            2) Move to the correct directory with the command CD TMCS.

            3) Type AUTOEXEC.  This will list the limit names and their
               equivalent file name on disc.

            4) Type LIMCOP.  This will copy the listed files to PROC
               files that will be listed with their names.  From this,
               you will choose the file you wish to restore.  Listed
               below are the limit and the PROC file name they are
               copied to.

                    Pilot is copied to PROC1.Tym
                    Copilot is copied to PROC2.Tym
                    Hostwatch is copied to PROC3.Tym
                    Events is copied to PROC4.Tym
                    Colornode is copied to PROC5.Tym
                    Colorline is copied to PROC6.Tym
                    Supeve is copied to PROC7.Tym

            5) To restore the limit desired, the steps are as follows:

               - Type NET/COM1 and after 5 seconds, type the terminal
                 identifier, which is an "a".

               - Log into the TMCS host that is destroyed and the
                 profile that the limit resides in.  For example, if the
                 limit to be rebuilt is the pilot limit, log into the
                 profile Netcon.

               - Press the ALT key and the PROC file number
                 simultaneously and the limit will begin to restore.
                 For example, if it is the pilot limit being restored,
                 press the ALT key and ONE key simultaneously due to the
                 pilot limit being in file Proc1.tym.  If is was the
                 copilot limit being restored, you would press the keys
                 ALT and TWO together due to the copilot limit residing
                 in the file PROC2.Tym.

               - You will know when the pilot and copilot limits are
                 completely restored, for they will DISPLAY NODE/LINES
                 when completed.  For the other limits, the line SAVE
                 LIMIT and the limit name will be on the bottom of your
                                                                          Page 3


                 screen to indicate completion of the restore.  If you
                 have any doubt that the restore completed, repeat the
                 ALT command and the restore will start again from the
                 beginning.

            5) In the case of the pilot limit, there is a second option.
               The limit pilot is also duplicated in the limit pilot2.
               If you suspect the pilot limit is destroyed, it can be
               restored with these simple steps:

               - Type SEL LIM PILOT2

               - Type SAVE LIM PILOT

               - Type SEL LIM PILOT

               The pilot limit has now been overwritten with the pilot2
               limit and you are ready for action.

                     **************************************



               It is the responsiblity of Network Control to make sure
          that all TMCS hosts are functioning normally.  Network Control
          is also responsible for helping users access a TMCS hosts when
          there are no ports available.  To fulfill these requirments
          are the following precedures:

            1) The various loggers/screens in the Network Control Center
               will be logged into pre-assigned hosts.  This will allow
               technicians to have the ability to glance at the
               loggers/screens and detect possible problems with
               indiviual hosts.  The following profiles/limits are to be
               logged into the following hosts, the first listed being
               the primary host, the second being the backup to be used
               when the primary is unavailable:

               Netcon / Pilot                    5325 / 1400
               Netcon / Copilot                  1400 / 5325
               Colornode / Colornode             7334 / 1400
               Colorline / Colorline              401 / 4040
               Hostwatch / Hostwatch             1819 / 4783
               Big5 / Events                     4783 / 1819
               Big5 / Supeve                     4040 /  401
               T1lines / Backbone                5325 / 7334
               T1lines / Backline                7334 / 5325

                    All limits are also located on 5325, 1400 and 7334
               along with their respective primary and backup hosts.

            2) A terminal in the back console in Network Control should
               always be logged into user TMCSA, which is to access a
               mux.  This mux is to have all TMCS host with ckt build to
               profile Netcon.  The purpose for this is to always have a
               port logged into the TMCS hosts from which you can hang
               extra users when a caller request access to a host.  When
               doing this, do not hang users TCSUP, NSSC or any of the
               ports logged into by netcon.  It is ok to log out these
               users if they have multiple jobs on the TMCS host.

                       **********************************
                       * REMOVING NODES/LINES FROM TMCS *
                       **********************************


               The need arises to remove nodes and lines that Network
          Control does not need to monitor from the pilot and copilot
          limits.  The following demonstrates the why's and how to's of
          this.

            1) Deinstalled nodes - When a node is deinstalled from the
               network, it is necessary to remove the node name from the
               TMCS hosts.  To do so use the command CLEAR NODE NAME
               (node number).

            2) Ignoring nodes - There are nodes on the network that
               Network Control does not need to watch and can therefore
               be ignored on the pilot limit.  When one of these nodes
               comes to a technicians attention, he must remove the node
               number from the pilot limit.  Do so in the following
               manner:

                    SEL LIM PILOT
                    IGNORE NODE (node number)
                    SAVE LIM PILOT
                    SAVE LIM PILOT2 (back-up pilot limit)

               DO NOT CLEAR THE NODE NAME when ignoring a node number.
               If this is done, others who might be monitoring the node,
               such as NSSC, would no longer be able to.

            3) Ignore Lines/Links - There are lines on the network which
               Network Control does not need to monitor, such as lab
               links.  Remove them from the copilot limit in the
               following manner:

                    SEL LIM COPILOT
                    IGN LINK (node number):(node2 number)
                    SAVE LIM COPILOT

               DO NOT IGNORE DEINSTALLED LINES.  They will be cleared
               when the nodes are reloaded for the project or ticket.

               Once any node or link is removed, it must be recorded in
          the TMCS binder under the approprieate section.  When doing
          so,p please be sure to indicate the reason for the action
          taken, such as a project or ticket and it's number.
