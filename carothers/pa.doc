                                  -------


               The purpose of this docuent is to provide Global Network
          Operations with a basic overview for how the Primary Access
          product works, basic troubleshooting and project procedures.
          This document will be focused on this groups particular needs
          only.

               This document should be used in parallel with the Primary
          Access document "Primary View User's Manual", which gives
          explanations of how to use the various Primary View menus.
                                                                     Page 2


                              ---------------
                              System Overview


               Primary Access is the designation name of a application
          whose function is to provide dial-up access into the Global
          Network without the use of standard modems.

       I.  Primary Access Box

               The basic hardware for Primary Access is referred to as the
          Primary Access box or PA box.  This box is a multi-shelved chasis
          containing slots for cards and buses for communication between
          the various cards and shelves.


               The basic cards that are of major concern to operations are
          as follows.

          1) Control Processor (CP)
             - Manages/connects one shelf to another thru a CP card on each
               shelf thru a daisy chain format.
             - Provides overall hardware and software management of
               application, including downloading of codes, configuration
               information, file management and Primary View notification.

          2) Ram Disk Card (RD)
             - Functions as boxes file system containing configurations,
               code, error logs, etc...
             - Physical connection to box for Primary View thru the DCE
               port 2 (top port) into box for consat addressable port.
             - Contains battery backup.

          3) Shelf Controller Card (SC) - Responsible for all inner and
             inter shelf busses.

          4) T-1 Card - Provides t-1 access into PA box.

          5) Digital Signal Processor Card (DSP) - Acts in place of
             standard modem.

               For more specific and extensive information on the PA
          hardware, the user should read the Primary Access System
          Architecture manual.

      II.  Primary View

               Primary View is a pc based application used to access,
          monitor and modify Primary Access boxes.  Currently, consats
          located at each site contain dedicated ports, referred to in this
          document as "access ports", by which logging into and accessing
          Primary Access boxes is achieved.

     III.  Data Flow T-1 to Nodes
                                                                     Page 3


               Data flow from user to the Global Tymnet Network is as
          follows.

       1) User dials up 800 number.  If a 800 number goes to more than one
          site with a PA box, the user's area code will determine which
          site the call goes to.  See appendix A for specific area code-PA
          box assignments.

       2) User call goes over T-1 and into PA box thru T-1 interface card.

       3) T-1 card's data is delivered to SC card over Shelf Databus and
          and thru to DSP cards.  Each one of these cards contains 2 ports,
          so the 24 DS-0's are send to 24 ports over 12 cards.  These
          channel-to-DSP port assignments are software configured into each
          box.

       4) DSP to card demodulates data as any modem.

       5) Data is transferred out the DSP card thru a RS232 connection into
          hardwired consat port.

       6) Data flows thru Tymnet network.

                              RESPONSIBLITIES
                             ----------------


       I.  Global Network Operations


               Global Network Operations will be responsible for monitor
          all Primary Access boxes in the global netowrk for problems.
          This will involved each shift logging into designated boxes and
          scanning each individual T-1 for bad T-1's and ports.  A schedule
          of each shift's responsibility as to which boxes they are to
          monitor is posted in Netcon and will be updated periodically.
          The technician should reference the section in this document on
          Monitoring and Troubleshooting for an explanation of how these
          tasks are to be accomplished.

               The following problems fall into Netcon's domain of problems
          to be persued.  The problem severity is listed with each problem.

          - All problems pertaining to system T-1's.  Severity one problem.

          - All problems involving 5 or more ports on an individual T-1 or
            shelf.  Severity one problem.

          - Any port problem identified by Network Operations while
            monitoring boxes.  Severity three problem.

          - Inability to access a PA box using Primary View if either
            Network Operations cannot acces or both Network Operations and
            CS and S cannot access a box.  Severity one problem.

            Network Operations IS NOT responsible for CS and S inability to
            access a box if they are the only one having the problem.  They
                                                                     Page 4


            should be referenced to their own tech support.

          - Any alarm which arises while logged into a box and monitoring
            it.  Severity will depend on problem alarm indicates.

          - Any system card failure, such as a Ram Disk, Shelf Controller
            or Control Processor failure.  Severity one problem.

               Besides the aforementioned problems with the sytem itself,
          Global Operations will also be reponsbile to

          - Open tickets on each problem encountered.

          - Interfaces with CS and S.

          - Escalate as designated within Global Operations.  No
            escalations should take place on a ticket from CS and S to
            Global Operations on a CS and S ticket without their First Line
            Tech support having first looked at the ticket beforehand.
                                                                     Page 5


      II.  CS and S

               CS and S's responsibilites in regards to Primary Access
          consist of the following areas.

          - Interfacing with customer and their problems.

          - Persueing sytem problems of less than 5 ports.

          - Escalating within CS and S organization.

          - Unable to log into Primary Access box while Network Control is.

     III.  NTS

               NTS is primarily responsible for 2nd level support.  No
          problem either from Global Operations or CS and S should be
          escalated to this group without first escalating to the first
          line support within each group.
                      Monitoring and Troubleshooting
                      ------------------------------

               Global Network Operations is the primary group responsible
          for the day to day monitoring and troubleshooting of Primary
          Access boxes.  This responsibility will involve

           - each shift logging into preassigned PA boxes and monitoring
             each T-1 for problems.  These assignments will be updated
             periodically as more boxes are placed in the network and can
             be found in Appendix G.

           - opening and persueing tickets.

           - interfacing with other groups and venders.

       I.  Most Common Problems

               The current method to monitor for problems on a Primary
          Access box is to log into each box individually from the Primary
          View pc and scan for problems.  The problems that are most likely
          to be seen by this method are


           - a "SEIZED" state on all T-1 channels on either the "IN" side
             or the "OUT" side.

           - a "SEIZED", "DISABLED" and/or "NOT CONNECTED" state on any DSP
             card's port.

           - yellow or red CSU alarms.

           - alarms in Primary View signaled from a Primary Access box.

               The next parts of this section will concentrate on how to
          monitor for these problems and how to proceed when they are
          found.
                                                                     Page 6


      II.  Using T-1's to Monitor for Problems

               Technicians will find most problems on each box by
          monitoring each individual T-1 for problems on it's channels.  To
          find these problems, the technician should do the following.

          1) Log into the desired PA box and "F10" to pull up the main
             system menu.

          2) Select the "Monitor System" menu item, enter a return, then
             hit the F4 key for all the T-1 choices on the system.  Notice
             that each T-1 list the shelf id and AT and T circuit ID are
             listed.

          3) Select the T-1 to monitor followed by several returns.

               At this point, a T-1 display with all 24 channels for the
          select T-1 should appear.  After a few seconds, it should update
          with the status of each channel.  The technician should then be
          able to observe any existing problems listed in the "Most Common
          Problems" section above.


     III.  Searching Alarms for Problems

               To view at previous alarms, a technician needs to hit the
          F10 key to pull up the main menu and select the "ALARMS" section
          of the menu.  A listing of previous alarms will display on the
          screen.

               If an alarm occurs while the technician is logged into the
          box, the top of the screen, no matter which menu the technician
          is in, will begin flashing.  Enter the "ALARMS" portion of the
          menu and verify what the alarm is.  New alarms will be in the
          color red.  To acknowledge the alarm, type an "A" and then answer
          "yes".

               When certain problems occur on a Primary Access box, such as
          a card failing with a "red" alarm, an alarm will be generated
          indicating that a problem has occurred.

      IV.  Verify Alarms on Individual Cards

       V.  Problem Resolution

               Resolutions of the most common problems which occurr will be
          defined in this section.  If there is any question on how to
          proceed, always contact Netcon's FLM.  The Primary Access User
          manual in Ops will explain how to "restart" and "reload" cards as
          requested in the instructions below in the "Run Diagnostics"
          section.

       A) T-1 in a "SEIZED" state on either the "in" or "out" side.

           - Open a ticket with AT and T on the circuit ID.

           - Restart card if circuit tested ok.
                                                                     Page 7


           - Reload card if restart failed.

           - If problem is still not resolved, send Novadyne to site to
             visually verified if T-1 card has red alarm and to also reseat
             the card.

           - If these steps still fail, notify Netcon's FLM.

       B) T-1 is howing a "yellow" or "red" alarm on the T-1 Monitor
          display.

                  When either of these alarm states occurs, there is a
             problem with either the AT and T circuit or one of the CSU's.
             This problem should be persued by turning the circuit over to
             AT and T and persueing as a normal circuit problem per
             established Ops procedures.

       C) DSP card has a "SEIZED" state on either the "in" or "out" side
          and/or a "NOT CONNECTED" state.

           - Restart card.

           - Reload the card if the condition did not clear with the
             restart.

           - If condition has not cleared with reload or restart, sent
             Novadyne to site to visually confirm if card is in a "red"
             alarm state and to reseat card.

           - If problem still does not clear, page the FLM for further
             instructions.

       D) Bad Ram Disk (RD) or Control Processor (CP) card.
          E) Bad Shelf Controller (SC) card.
                                                                     Page 8


                                  Tickets
                                  -------

               This section will describe the basics of handling the
          tickets for Primary Access.

       I.  Opening Tickets

               Global Operation will be responsible for opening tickets on
          any problem encountered during monitoring of the PA boxes.
          Tickets opened by Ops should be for every problem encountered
          when monitoring the PA boxes and turned over to first line tech
          support for review before closing.

               When openng tickets, the following guidelines need to be
          followed.

          1) Always indicate the Primary Access box in question (ie:
             Chicago 2).

          2) Always indicate the shelf and card location of the card in
             question.

          3) T-1 tickets should also include
             - T-1 ID (id:1A) indicated in Appendix B.
             - Circuit ID should be AT and T circuit id.

          4) Port tickets should also include
             - Port ID on DSP card.
             - Consat node-kernal host-slot host-port id available either
               in Appendix B or Primary View.
             - Ticket should be opened on the consat host ID.
             - Circuit ID should be 800  .

      II.  Control of Tickets

               Whichever group opens a ticket will remain the responsible
          control group and persons to persue the ticket.  A control group
          may only be changed with the consent of the requested group.

     III.  Escalations

               All tickets should follow established escalation procedures
          with the following exceptions.

          1) Any ticket opened on a T-1 not resolved by Telco or a T-1 card
             restart or load should be escalated to FIRST LINE TECH SUPPORT
             IMMEDIATELY.

          2) ANY NON-DSP problem should be escalated immediately to First
             Line Tech Support with the exception of guidelines for T-1
             problems already described.
                                                                     Page 9


                       Login Strings on Primary View
                       -----------------------------

               Login strings for Primary Access boxes are, as the name
          implies, strings which allow a user to enter into a Primary
          Access box for monitoring and/or other operations.  These strings
          are formatted as follows:

                      *,*,a*,username:host.port;pw*r

               Each string will allow access thru an assigned tymcom host
          and port into the designated Primary Access box.  These host/port
          id's are supplied by BT Network Engineering.

               The following sections discuss how to setup, modify or
          delete login strings.  If a user wished information on the login
          process once a login string is established, they should see the
          section titled "Logging into Primary Access".

       I.  Adding/Modifying Login String

          1) Enter "cd *".  This will place the user in the main directory.

          2) Enter "primacc<rtn>.  A white screen will appear saying
             "PRIMARY ACCESS" and the version id.  This command is the
             batch file which executes the commands "cd pv27b*bin" and
             "pv".  The user may enter these commands individually as well
             instead.

          3) Enter a "return".  This will bring the user to the prompt
             "PRIMARY ACCESS CONNECTION NAME".

          4) Press the F10 key.  A menu will appear.  Up/down arrow to the
             selection "Link" and enter "return".

          5) A menu should appear on the screen with one option being
             "Setup PV to PA".  Up/down arrow to this selection and enter
             "return".

          6) A menu will appear with the options "Define Com Ports" and
             "Define PA Connection".  Up/down arrow to the second option
             and enter "return".

          7) A window stating "Primary Access Connection" will appear.  At
             this point,

           - If the user is installing a new connection, enter the name for
             the new connection and enter two "returns".

           - If the user is altering or reviewing a previous connection,
             hit the F4 key and a menu will appear listing the currently
             available connections.  Up/down arrow to the desired
             connection and enter two "returns".

           **In steps 9-12, if a user does not wish to alter any of the
             current information on a line, a "return" will leave the
             information unchanged.
                                                                    Page 10


           - If a user is deleting a connection, go to section "Deleting
             Login Strings" for assistance.

          8) A screen should appear with the following items listed:

                - Connection ID
                - Baud Rate
                - Dial String
                - Com Port

          9) Connection ID is defined by Primary View.  Enter a "return".

         10) Baud Rate must be defined.  As this element is highlighted,
             press F4.  This will list the options available.  Up/down
             arrow to the desspeed and enter a "return".  Global
             Network Operations should use a speed of 2400.

         11) Dial String must be defined.  The format of
             "*,*,a*,username:khost.access port id;password*r<rtn>" must be
             used and followed exactly.  The username, khost and access
             port id are provided by BT Network Engineering in San Jose or
             by the designate persons in Global Network Operations or NTS.
             The username password may be obtained from the designated
             Global Network Operations or Nts person.

         12) Com Port must be defined.  Enter the number of the com port
             and enter "return".

         13) A menu will appear asking yes/no.  Up/down arrow to "yes" if
             all information is correct and enter a "return".  If an error
             is present in the inputted information, select "no" and enter
             a "return".  The user will then be allowed to reenter the
             information.  Enter a "return" for any line the does not need
             changing.

         14) Once the new login string is entered, the user should be back
             to the menu with the listings "Define Com Ports" and "Define
             PA Connections".  Hit "escape" key twice to return to Primary
             View Main menu.


      II.  Deleting Login String

          1) Follow steps 1-7 in section "Adding/Modifying Login String".

          2) Hit the "F6" key.  A yes/no menu will appear.  Up/down arrow
             to "YES" and enter a return.  The string will at this point be
             deleted.
                                                                    Page 11


               Logging into Primary View and Primary Access
               --------------------------------------------

       I.  From DOS into Primary View

          1) Use the HIQ pc in the upper right hand section of Network
             Control.

          2) Type "cd *".  This will move the pointer to the main
             directory.

          3) Type "primacc<rtn>".  A white screen should appear saying
             "PRIMARY ACCESS" and the version id.  Version 27B should be
             running.  This command is a batch file that executes the
             commands "CD PV27B*BIN" and then "PV".  The user may type
             these commands individually as well as running the batch file.

          4) Type a "RETURN".  This should bring you to the prompt "PRIMARY
             ACCESS CONNECTION NAME".

      II.  Logging into Primary Access Box

       A) From Primary View

          1) Execute steps in section "From DOS into Primary View".

          2) Press the F10 key.  A menu will appear.  Up/down arrow to the
             selection "Link" and press a "RETURN".

          3) A menu should be present on the screen with one of the
             selections "Login to PA".  Up/down arrow to this selection and
             press "RETURN".  The window stating "PRIMARY ACCESS CONNECTION
             NAME" will appear.

          4) Press the F4 key.  A list will appear with a selection of
             Primary Access boxes to log into.  Up/down arrow to the
             desired box and press "RETURN".  In the upper right hand
             portion of the screen, you should see appear "NOT CONNECTED",
             "INITIALIZING", "CONNECTED".

          5) Following the sequence in step 7, a window should appear
             requesting the user's login name and password.  Type in the
             designated username and password in all capitals.


       B.  From Another Primary Access Box

               If the user wishes to access a Primary Access box when
          logged into another, the user should follow the following steps.

          1) Press F9 key.

          2) A menu will appear asking Yes/No as to whether it is wished to
             log out.  Up/down arrow to "Yes" and the system will return to
             the DOS prompt in user "PV27B*Bin".

          3) Type "PV<rtn>" and repeat steps 4-8 of Section I above.
                                                                    Page 12


     III.  Unsucessful Logins

               If a user is unable to log into a Primary Access box, the
          following checks should be done, and if all are done and the user
          still has no idea why access cannot be obtained, the designated
          Netcon FLM should be paged.  It is always a good idea, before
          paging the on-call, to have another group attempt to login to
          verify if the problem is universal.  If CS and S is the group who
          cannot access, they should page their own on-call.

          1) Login string incorrect - If a user's login string has an error
             in it's format, this will cause failure when attempting to log
             into a PA box.  If the login string being used is new or has
             been modified, go back and verify the login string format as
             correct.

             Besides the login string format, the com port and baud rate
             should also be verified as correct when verifiying the login
             string.

             The instructions in the section title "Login in Strings on
             Primary View" will help the user in verification.  If the user
             does find a login string problem, follow the instructions in
             the designated section to correct.

          2) Node or Slot/Host problem - Each PA box is accessed thru a
             assigned host and port.  The user needs to verify that the
             host and node in the login string is up and operational and
             take appropriate action if a failure exists on either.

          3) Port hung or in use - If a "Not Connected" is occurring when
             trying to log into a Primary Access box, the port needs to be
             verified as available for access.  Use the following process
             for verification:

             - Log into DDT on the access ports slot (if you do not already
               know how to enter into DDT, have someone show you or page).
               Which node, host and port can be obtained from appendix B on
               the Primary Access Configuration Summary chart for the
               particular site.

             - Once in the slot, enter "?stat<rtn>".  This will place the
               user into XDDT.

             - Enter "as<rtn>".  This will list all the ports in this hosts
               slot.

             - Scan the port id's for the required port id.  If the port is
               in a state to accept a log in, it should look as follows:

               PORT ISIS RLA DTR  CP DSR ...
                43  FFFF  FF  FF  FF  FF ...

               In this example for port 43, notice columns ISIS thru DSR
               have all "F"'s as data.  This means the port should be
               available for access and the technician should continue to
               look for another reason.
                                                                    Page 13


             - If the port is in a state where it has a circjit build thru
               it, it will look as the next example below.  Note the "ISIS"
               data is not "FFFF", but the other readings are.

               PORT ISIS RLA DTR  CP DSR ...
                43   15   FF  FF  FF  FF ...

               If the user finds this situation, there probably is someone
               already logged into the box.  Contact CS and S and verify
               noone there is logged in.  If not, continue to investigate.

            4) Verify the com port is plugged into the back of the pc.
                                                                    Page 14


                                 USERNAMES
                                 ---------
       I.  Username Assignment

               Every group which uses Primary Access will have one or more
          usernames assigned to them depending on their individual needs.
          These names and licenses are determined and administered by the
          designated persons in Global Network Control and NTS.

               A current list of Primary Access usernames and passwords is
          kept with these designated persons.

      II.  Duplicate Usernames

               Certain groups will have duplicate usernames.  These
          usernames will be indentical in both name and password except for
          one trait, namely one will have all uppercase lettering and the
          other all lowercase lettering.  For example, user John Doe, if
          assigned duplicate users may have username 'JOHND" with password
          "ABC" and another named "johnd" with a password of "abc".  The
          purpose for this is to assign different licensing to each so that
          when login occurs, Primary Access logs may or may not be uploaded
          to Primary View at that time, depending on the situation and/or
          user preference.

               Having the ability not to have log files uploaded to Primary
          View upon login is important.  When a upload occurs, the pc is
          locked into the process and nothing else may be performed.  If a
          user needed to do immediate troubleshooting or perform a quick
          task, not having to wait many minutes for uploading of logs may
          be very useful.  A user may also have limited amounts of disk
          space to upload log files, especially laptops, and may mot wish
          to upload in order to maintain adequate disk space on their pc.



          Appendix A - Primary Access 800 Numbers Access Information
                       ---------------------------------------------


               This appendix contains information pertaining to each 800
          number currently used for user access thru Primary Access.  The
          specific information for each 800 number includes:

          1) The 800 number id itself.

          2) Cities which have access thru a particular 800 number.

          3) Area codes which access specific city thru specified 800
             number.

          4) State an accessing area code is located.

          5) BTNA nodes which Primary Access is configured to for the
             specified 800 number.

          6) Any hours and/or customer access limitations.



          Appendix B - Primary Access Box Configurations Appendix
                       ------------------------------------------


               This appendix contains Primary Access hardware
          configurations for each box in the Global Network.  The
          configurations are listed by city/site in alphabetical order.
          Each site is divided into two charts, one which gives an overview
          of the whole site and one which gives specific hardware slot
          information on each box.

               The first chart, the Primary Access Configuration Summary,
          gives an overview look of a site and the boxes located on it.
          The overview looks includes

           - Pertinent site information.

           - Primary Access box access port id which allows user access
             into box from the global network.

           - T-1 ID used to designate a T-1 and the hardware slots
             associateed with it on a particular box.

           - Telco T-1 circuit id.

           - Megacom 800 number assigned to T-1 for dial access.

           - Baud rate designated on consat.

           - Tymnet node number, kernal host number and consat port id
             associate with T-1 and it assigned DSP cards.

           - DSP hardware slots assigned to specified T-1.

               The second chart, the Primary Access Hardware Slot
          Configuration, is a chart which give specific information about
          each box on a per hardware slot basis and identifies the port by
          port connections to a Tymnet node/host/port .  The chart
          specifies

           - Card type which identifies the card type in a hardware slot.

           - T-1 id identifies which T-1 a DSP card is s/w assigned to.

           - Below each shelf is listed the T-1 ID's , the megacom number
             assigned to it and the consat node/host number.

           - DDT port identifies which consat port is assigned to a DSP
             card's port.

               From the information provided, a user should be able to
          indentify the path a dialing in user takes into the T-1 and into
          the Tymnet equipment.  In the example following, if the user
          looks at slot 13 on the box, they should be able to identify that

           - The megacom number the user dialed up is 800-222-0555.



           - The T-1 the user dials thru is identified as t1 "1A" and it's
             circuit id is DHEC675700.

           - The T-1 goes to a DSP2 card.

           - The DSP2 card is hardwired to ports 30 and 31 on Tymnet node
             11151.
