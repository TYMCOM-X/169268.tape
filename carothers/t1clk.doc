          Over the last several months, there has been a problem on
     the T-1 backbone manifested by simultaneous link drops and an
     unacceptable amount of frame and clock slips.  This problem has
     been resolved by

      1) adding daxes to multiple trunks.
      2) each node having a priority one clocking source off a dax or
         a node with a dax as a primary clocking source.
      3) each node having a secondary clocking source off a node or
         trunk with a different dax from which it takes it's priority
         one clocking.

     This clocking scheme is a change from the scheme I inherited
     which had

      1) a single dax supplying all priority one clocking for the
         Backbone.
      2) each node using internal clocking as secondary source.


          Since the new clocking scheme has been introduced, the
     Backbone has been stable and the network slips have decreased
     dramatically.  I believe it is important to relate the events
     that led up to this final fix and relate any other information
     that I feel is pertinent.

      1) Met with MCI who indicated problem would be resolved by
         adding multiple daxes at specified links.  They informed me
         that they had previously discussed this possibility with
         Keith.
      2) Discussed with Riley Van Dyke of NET the information that MCI
         had related.  He disagreed that this scheme would be needed.
         I asked him to confirm the current network scheme was set up
         as Keith and him has specified, which he did.  He found one
         discrepancy at the New York node, which had a 56kb as a
         secondary source, which was removed.
      3) Had conference call with MCI and NET to discuss differing
         approaches.  MCI was convinced that the problem would be
         resolved with the extra daxes while NET strongly disagreed
         indicating that not enough drift could occur in so short a
         time to cause the multiple link outages.
           It was decided to go with the MCI approach and they were
         requested to schedule and deploy the daxes.  NET indicated
         concern that this would work, but may mask another problem.
      4) NET was contacted to inform Riley that dax deployment would
         begin soon and that I wanted him to review the clocking
         scheme so we could discuss adjustments that would need to be
         made to the clocking configuration on the Backbone to allow
         for the new daxes.  I was informed that Riley had been in a
         motorcycle accident and that Tilton Quon would handle the
         account on a temporary basis.
      5) Tilton contacted me the next day and indicated that there
         were problems with the current clocking scheme.  Tilton, Ian
         Jalliot, Tom Strickland, all of NET met with Robert Mckernie
         and myself to discuss these discrepancies.
           The discrepancies were mainly having more master nodes than
         required on the network in the current configuration.  NET
                                                                  Page 2


         also indicated that these could be the cause of the network's
         instability and that clearing this up could solve the
         problem.  It was decided to go forward with the changes NET
         suggested while the daxes were being deployed in the network,
         but they would not be pointed to at that time.
      6) The first change agreed to was to change node 10 to a slave
         node from a master.  NET indicated that this could solve the
         multiple drops on the west coast.  It was requested that
         before NET-Tac made the change, I drop the trunk by putting
         the Fremont-NY trunk into loop.  This would cause the
         multiple drops.  The correction would be made and the test
         rerun again to see if problem was cleared.
           Per NET's instructions, the trunk was dropped, but the
         multiple drop affect did not occur.  Dropping Fremont-Newport
         Beach was also done to try and recreate, but the multiple
         drops did not occur.  I had NET-Tac make the change anyway.
      7) After the failure of the test NET requested, I went back and
         reviewed the clocking scheme.  It appeared that the outages
         were occurring "downstream" in the clocking scheme.  For
         example, when Fremont-NY would drop, Fremont would go to it's
         internal clock, mismatching the timing between the Fremont
         and Newport Beach nodes, which would then drop the
         Fremont-Newport Beach link, which would mismatch the timing
         between the Newport Beach and Dallas nodes, causing the
         Newport Beach-Dalls link.
           I tested this conclusion by dropping the Fremont-Newport
         Beach link expecting the Newport Beach-Dallas link to drop
         during it was "downstream" on the clocking scheme and not the
         Fremont-NY, during this link was "upstream" and Fremont would
         remain on dax timing while Newport Beach would shift to
         internal clocking.  As expected, Newport Beach-Dallas went
         down, but Fremont-NY did not.
      8) NET was informed of what I had done and was requested to
         reconfigure the clocking scheme into the configuration listed
         at the beginning of this memo as the solution I wanted.
      9) The scheme was put into place and since then, the Backbone
         has been much more stable with few multi-link hits and far
         fewer frame and clock slips.

          At this point, I would also like to indicate some side notes
     which I believe are important.
     1) It appears that when the first dax, Fremont-NY was put into
        place, the Backbone was not reconfigured correctly to meet the
        new scheme even thou Riley VanDyke indicate it was fine.  I
        believe this scheme was left over from the previous scheme
        which had Island Timing.
     2) The problem with the scheme may have been found later if not
        Tilton Quon had been assigned to the account upon the
        motorcyle accident Riley got into.  His review of the scheme
        and puzzlement of it put NET's configuration in question,
        whereas before, the problem had been looked at as a MCI issue.
     3) NET's clocking scheme to meet additional daxes was inadequate,
        for it had priority 2 clocking remaining as internal.  This
        was due apparently to NET's insistance that their IDNX box
        clocking could not drift enought for quite a period of time to
        cause problem.
     4) Ian Jalliot and Tilton Quon of NET informed me that looping
                                                                  Page 3


        the trunk cards would cause the multiple drop to reoccur.  It
        did not.
     5) The night the configuration was scheduled to go into place, it
        did not due to NET having on project that fe should be
        on-site.  They were informed at the previous meeting to check
        to confirm if this was necessary and if it would cost
        anything, else no fe would be requested.  The project went the
        next evening.  Although the project was moved up at my
        request, this should not have been on the project without
        first clearing with myself.
     6) After reviewing the clocking scheme the morning after the
        reconfiguration, I contacted NET-Tac to inform them errors
        were made during work and that changes were needed.
          Besides the errors I found, they found an inconsistency
        between the h/w and /w configuration at the Fremont node on
        the priority one clocking.  This discrepancy may have been the
        cause for the problem on the Fremont-NY link.  Since it's fix,
        the link has been stable.  MCI saw the problems on this link
        on the west side of the Haward dax on this link.  This is
        consistent with what NET found.
     7) Ian Jalliot informed me that when the changes to the
        configurati on would be made, the links would not need to be
        dropped.  When checking the next morning, I found this not to
        be the case.  The individual I talked to at NET-Tac indicated
        that they had to drop in order to do the changes and this was
        an expected event.
     8) MCI did not install the dax on SF-Denver on the date they
        indicated they had.  Their had been a problem, but Ariene
        Draper had not been notified.  This was discovered upon my
        review of each node following the reconfiguration, where I
        found clock slip were occurring on the neighbor links to the
        SF-Denver trunk, but not on that trunk and no where else.

          I would like to commend Adriene Draper for her determination
     and professionalism during this problem.  She kept me current on
     everything they were doing and followed up on the massive amount
     of tickets she incurred while this situation was being sorted
     out.

          I am far less impressed with NET.  On several occasions they
     gave me wrong information and the clocking schemes designed and
     review of them were inadequate.  I recommend that Riley VanDyke
     be taken off the account and Tilton Quon remain on it.

          If there are any questions, please let me know.
                                        Thanks
