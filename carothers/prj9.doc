                                PROJECT PROCEDURES
                                ------------------


               Projects are requests received by Netcon from Projects
          Implemenaton (PI) to load new code into Tymnet public nodes.
          The new code will contain changes in the node configuration
          that are needed.  For example, addition/deletion of a host,
          addition/deletion of a line, etc...may be requested.

               The following is a guide in how to handle the loads
          competently and assumes you understand TYM files and Unix load
          files.


       I. PRE-LOAD CHECKS
          ---------------

            A) Check in the production directory for nib and n00 files.
               This is done by using the CD command to move to the
               correct directory and the do a "ls -l n*" command.  There
               should be a minumum of a nib and n00 files and they
               should have the same date and time.

                    You may also find n01, n02...files which are for the
               indiviual slots on the node.  There dates and times may
               vary.  This is fine.

            B) For system projects, type out the tymfile using the pull
               command to confirm that the load date is for that evening
               and check to see that the correct project id is also
               listed.  For handwrittens, check the date using the ls
               command mentioned in step A to see if the date genned is
               today.

            C) Shut the node as necessary to start to decrease the
               number of ports and/or passthrus on the node.  When doing
               so, the following should be followed.

                 1) NEVER shut a deadended node (a node with only one
                    neighbor).

                 2) When shutting nodes with multiple links, leave the
                    neighbors unshut that are deadended neighbors.
                    Also, leave one extar link open on the node that is
                    not deadended to allow access by the deadended
                    neighbors thru this node to the network.

                         To confirm that you have shut multi-linked
                    nodes correctly, check the shut links to confirm
                    that they do not go to a deadended node.  Besides
                    this, try to log into the node shut thru the
                    utilities XRAY or ODDJOB.  If you get a "CIRCUIT
                    BUSY" message, you do not have access to this node.
                    Remove shuts until you are sucessful in logging into
                    the node.
                                                                          Page 2


      II. RELOADING NODES
          ---------------

            A) Handwritten projects will be loaded unless otherwise
               requested on it.  The system projects will be loaded if
               in the section ACTIVITY at the bottom of the project
               report states to SHUT/LOAD or LOAD a node.  If it only
               says to SHUT, you will not reload unless you have a
               confirmation from an fe that it is alright to do so.  In
               this case, there will be written confirmation on the
               report by Netcon personel indicating the fe called and
               requested a reload.

            B) Log into XRAY of the node you wish to load and take a
               hardcopy of the ND command and the HS command.

            C) Confirm that the load on the node is low enough to allow
               for a minumum of disruption to the network and customers.
               As a general guideline to use, if a switcher has less
               than 50 passthrus before evening supervisor swap, go
               ahead and load, and after the swap, load regaurdless of
               the number of passthrus.  For Isis and Consat machines, 5
               ports or less means you can load it.  If you have more
               than 5 ports, you must wait until after supmove before
               loading.  If a node is identified as a PRODIGY node, you
               must first get Customer Services's permission before
               taking the node.  NO NODE should be taken down before 10
               pm local time.

            D) Dload/reload the node.  Take a new xray snap of the node
               and compare it with the one from before the reload.
               Check for any changes other than those listed on the
               project.  If you suspect any type of problem, the next
               section will give you some common problems which occur.


                                                                          Page 3


     III. COMMON PROBLEMS FROM LOADS
          --------------------------

            A) Node does not come up - If a node is loaded with a new
               code and it does not come up in the net, try loading the
               new code again.  If you get a 0-rec, open a ticket and
               send to Chad.  The node will need to be rebooted and
               loaded with the backup code.  Send the ticket o/t PI
               after the node is back up indicating for them to correct
               the code and include the node as incomplete on your
               project summary report.

                    If the node takes the load again, but still will not
               come up in the net, try loading the backup code.  If the
               node comes up, the problem is with the new code.  Include
               this node as an incomplete on your project summary
               report.

            B) Hosts

                    When new code is loaded, not all slots will always
               come up.  Use the following guidelines to determine if
               action is required.

                 1) New host does not come up - If you have a project
                    which is to add a host, after the new code is
                    loaded, do a probe snap of the node.  If the new
                    host is not showing, type out the TYM file to be
                    sure the new host is included in it.  If it is not,
                    notify PI to correct code.

                         If the new host is showing in the TYM file,
                    check the project to see if the host is due to come
                    up at that time or the next day.  If it is due up
                    the next day, no need to pursue.  If not, contact
                    NCS and notify them of situation.  They will pursue
                    with that customer's CS.

                 2) Old host does not come up - If a host that was
                    previously up before the reload with new code does
                    not come up, and is not to be deleted, contact
                    Customer Service to persue with the cs for slot
                    code.  If it is a consat or outdial slot, please
                    persue with PI.  The section for PROJECTS
                    IMPLEMENTATION, part A, step 4, will help you to
                    determine if it is a consat or outdial.

            C) Line Outages

                 1) New line does not come up - After loading the new
                    code, do and xray snap using the ND command to see
                    if the line came up.  If it did not, check to be
                    sure if it is listed at the bottom of this command
                    at the T1LINK NEIGHBORS DOWN point (see appendix a).
                    If it is not, contact PI to check the code.  If it
                    is showing in xray, do not pursue the outage for 24
                    hours.  After that time, if the link is still down,
                                                                          Page 4


                    open a ticket on the outage.

                 2) Old line does not come up - After loading the new
                    code, if a line that was up previously does not come
                    up, you need to determine why.

                         Most times, a line does not come up due to the
                    number of sync lines being reduced by one.  This
                    normally occurs when your project calls for deletion
                    of a line.  You can determine if the reduction of
                    sync lines has occurred by comparing the hardcopy
                    xray from before the reload with the current xray
                    snap.


                         If the line which is down is to a dead-ended
                    node (a node with only one neighbor), reload the
                    back code file because the the dead-ended node will
                    be off the network.  Make sure the dead-ended node
                    comes back up on the network and open a ticket on
                    your project node asking the fe to rotate the line
                    that was down up on the sync lines.  This will allow
                    you to load the new code the next night and not have
                    that line down again.

                         If the line which is down does not run to a
                    dead-ended node, use the rule of thumb that if the
                    neighbor node has only one link up, reload the
                    project node with the backup code.  If it has more
                    than one link up, leave the new code in.  In either
                    case, open a ticket and ask the fe to rotate the
                    neighbor link up on the sync lines.  The ticket
                    should be severity 3 and indicate that Netcon will
                    reload the node the next evening.  Include the
                    ticket number on your project summary report.
                                                                          Page 5


      IV. PROJECT SUMMARY REPORT
          ----------------------

               At the end of a shift in which scheduled projects are
          done, a project summary report will need to be sent reporting
          on the successes and failures on that night's projects.  It
          should be divided into 2 catagories, complete and incomplete
          projects.  For each node in these catagories, the following
          info should be given:

            A) Directory and system the node code is located on.

            B) Node code file that was used.

            C) Project number or handwritten project id.

            D) Information pertaining to project you deem necessary to
               include.  It is especially important to include when a
               load failed and the reason why.

            E) List of totals of the projects on your particular shift.
               The totals to be included are:

                 1) Total Projects - These are the total ontyme projects
                    received.

                 2) Total Handwritten Projects - These are the total
                    nodes delivered on projects literally written by
                    hand and brought to Netcon by PI.

                 3) Total Loads - The total number of loads done.

                 4) Incomplete Projects - Total number of projects that
                    were not completed.

               Send the project summary report via ontyme.  Use the
          command ":S R CC * PROJECTS<CR><CR>" to send the report.  A
          sample of a report can be found on appendix b.
                                                                          Page 6


       V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION GROUP
          ----------------------------


               Project Implementation (PI) is the group responsible for
          almost all node codes loaded by Network Control.  There
          responsibilities include genning node code, consat and outdial
          slot code, new code for projects and making sure the correct
          code is in production.

            A) Paging PI:  Occasions will occur when someone, usually a
               cs, fe or NCS will request PI to be paged for a possible
               code problem.  IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE NETWORK
               CONTROL TECHNICIAN to determine if the problem falls
               under PI's responsibilities.  There will be times when
               you are unsure.  Page Netcon's on-call supervisor for
               instructions.  NEVER PAGE PI TO ASK IF THEY SOMETHING IS
               THEIR RESONSIBILITY.

                    The following is a list of when never to page PI and
               was compiled from this author's experience:

                 1) International nodes - PI is only responsible for
                    international nodes in Canada.  All others are the
                    responsiblity of another party.

                 2) Dedicated nodes - There are nodes on the public
                    network which are not the responsibility of PI, but
                    are genned by other groups and located in the US.
                    These nodes are referred to as dedicated nodes.

                         To determine if a node is such, the tymfile
                    must be typed out.  At the top, it will list the
                    person(s) who is responsible for the nodes code.  An
                    example of a normal node code for PI is found on
                    appendix b, while the node code for a dedicated
                    group, in this case Payments Systems, can be found
                    in appendix d.  Groups such as Payments Systems,
                    EDI, RCA and FTCC are other examples of these
                    groups.  It is up to the person calling to contact
                    the appropriate person in these cases, not Netcon's.
                    If they need further assistance, have them call
                    Customer Support.

                 3) 0-Rec on loading a node - PI is NEVER to be paged
                    when a node will not load.  It is a hardware
                    problem.  For example, if an fe is on-site working
                    on a project and 0-rec occurs on a load attempt, it
                    is his problem.  The code cannot be determined bad
                    if it will not load into the node.

                         The only exeception to this rule is whan a new
                    code is loaded into the node and it does not come up
                    in the net and 0-rec is received on subsequent load
                    attempts.  The node will need to be rebooted and
                    loaded with the backup code.  The new code can be
                    looked at in am.
                                                                          Page 7


                 4) Slot codes - PI is only responsible for slot codes
                    for rotaries and outdials.  An example is shown in
                    appendix C.  Note the ATI listed on slot 1.  This
                    indicates a rotary or outdial.

                         Customer slot codes ARE NEVER handled by PI.
                    The customer's cs oor the on-call cs is reponsible.
                    If the cs is having problems with their slot code,
                    it should go to their manager, not PI.  PI should
                    only get involved once the cs comes back and says
                    the slot code is fine and specifies a possible node
                    code problem causing the slot problems.  PI should
                    then be contacted and conferenced called in with the
                    cs.  DO NOT get involved as a middle man with them.
                    It is up to them to work out any problem between
                    themselves.
                                                                     Page 8


      VI. PAGING PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
          -----------------------------

               Project Implementation provides a service in which they
          supply a designated person to handle code problems which occur
          during off hours.  Once it has been determined that a problem
          is PIs's responsibiltiy, the following criteria determines who
          to contact:

            A) Between 11 pm thru 7 am Sunday night/Monday morning thru
               Thursday night/Friday morning, call upstairs to Donna
               Sakai or Vicki Ayers.  They will help you with any
               problems.

            B) During lunchtime, call up to anyone in PI.  If they
               cannot be contacted, page them using the criteria below.

            C) During the other times, 6-11 pm Monday thru Fridays, page
               the on-call.


               If the criteria calls for the contacting of the on-call
          person, the technician should proceed in the following manner.

            A) Page the on-call person once.

            B) If the on-call person does not respond within 20 minutes,
               page a second time.

            C) If the on-call person does not call back by 30 minutes
               after the orginal page, call their home number.

            D) If you cannot contact the on-call person after paging and
               calling the home number, call the first back-up person at
               home and if you cannot reach them, call the second
               back-up.  If you cannot contact either back-up person,
               contact Debbie Hoffman at home.

               Occasionally, the PI person cannot solve the problem
          presented to them.  In this case, after one hour, they are to
          escalate the problem to their supervisor.  If this person
          cannot solve the problem after another hour, they are to
          escalate the problem to Debbie Hoffman.
                                                                          Page 9


     VII. PULLING PROJECTS OFF HOST 38
          ---------------------------


               Copies of all project reports are kept on Host 38 under
          the username DBSCHED in seperate files.  The file names fall
          into the following structure:

                              (DBSCHED)41289E.PL

                              DBSCHED = Username
                              41289   = Project Number
                              E       = Region (East or West)
                              PL      = FE District

               It will sometimes be necessary to type out a copy of a
          project report to reference.  If you know the file name,
          simply use the following command:

                              Type (DBSCHED)Filename.Ext

               At times, all a technician will have is the project
          number, but not the file name.  To find out the file name, use
          the following command (using project number 33742 as example):

                              Dir (DBSCHED)33742 .*

          This command will list out any files which contain the project
          number in the file name.

               If no file names are received, it will be wise to confirm
          you are logged into Host 38 and that the command was correctly
          used.  If all was done correctly, the project is not on the
          host.

               In appendix E is an example of a project report.
                                                                         Page 10


    VIII. FE COORDINATION PROJECTS
          ------------------------

               Projects will be given to Netcon with nodes indicated to
          be SHUT only and not loaded.  These nodes are the FE
          COORINATIONS, nodes which are not to be loaded unless a fe,
          either by ontyme or phone call, has requested Netcon to load
          it.

               There is a time limit on how long after the installation
          date on the project these nodes can be loaded, that being 72
          hours.  If a fe calls after 72 hours, Netcon WILL NOT load the
          code and the fe will need to reschedule the project with PI.

               It is PI's responsibility to move the project code out of
          production and back into staging when this time frame has
          expired.  For example, if a project is scheduled for 10/22 and
          FSC has not coordinated the load, PI is to BACKOUT of the code
          before leaving on 10/25.  If PI receives a call from an fe
          after this timeframe, they will send a new project down to
          Netcon with a new install date.


      IX. PROJECT LOGSHEETS
          -----------------

               In order to track what projects are brought into Netcon
          from PI, PI will bring logsheets down with all projects, both
          normal projects and hadwrittens, listed on it.  The technician
          who receives them is responsible to check that the list is
          accurate and show the discrepancies to PI.  The sheet is to be
          signed off if all is satisfactory and a copy is to be placed
          in front of the projects binder and another returned to PI for
          their records.  NO PROJECTS ARE TO BE ACCEPTED without a
          logsheet from PI.
