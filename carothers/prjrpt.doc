                 Topic: Project Reports

              
          ===============================================================


               This last month, I have taken over the responsibility of
          doing the project totals for each week.  This has required me
          to review all project reports to obtain my numbers.  Over this
          period, I have seen so many errors on the reports, from
          misspellings, to information missing, to wrong dates that I
          cannot wonder what impression Netcon is making on the people
          that see these reports.

               Due to this, I would like to lay out the rules to be
          followed when doing a project report.

          - Reports are to be reviewed by the individual who sent them
            for errors.  If errors are discovered of any kind, they are
            to be corrected and a new report sent.  Always cancel the
            previous report when a revised one is sent.

          - Each shift is to do their own report.  In the rare
            circumstance that it is passed on to the next shift, the
            person who passed it on will be held accountable if any
            errors are found on the report.

          - All projects are to be filed away with the project report
            filed on top of the projects that are listed within a
            report.  Projects are to be filed under the load date of the
            projects in the file cabinet.

          - Each node requested on a handwritten sheet counts as one
            handwritten project.  Therefore, if you have a PI
            handwritten sheet with 14 loads on it, it counts as 14
            handwritten projects, not one.

          - On handwrittens, always put the reason for a load when
            indicated.  Do not just put "handwritten".

          - When there is a load request for "slot only" and not the
            whole node, be sure this is indicated on the project report.

          - Always list the FE's name next to a project when a FE is
                                                                  Page 2


            involved.

          - Wnen PI is paged, indicate on the project report that they
            were paged and why next to the node they were paged for.

          - When a project is incomplete, always list the reason for the
            project (ie:  project id, reason for handwritten) and the
            reason it was not done (ie:  no FE coordination, hardware
            not arrived, etc).

          - Project totals on the bottom of a report are to be done just
            as shown on the example report.  All incompleted project
            reasons are to be listed on the bottom with the total number
            for that catagory.

               I have attached an example of a correct project report
          onto the end of this memo.
