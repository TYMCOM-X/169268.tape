                      ------------------------------

               Global Network Operations is the primary group responsible
          for the day to day monitoring and troubleshooting of Primary
          Access boxes.  This responsibility will involve

           - each shift logging into preassigned PA boxes and monitoring
             each T-1 for problems.  These assignments will be updated
             periodically as more boxes are placed in the network and can
             be found in Appendix G.

           - opening and persueing tickets.

           - interfacing with other groups and venders.

       I.  Common Problems

               The most common problems that a Ops.  technician will need
          to deal with fall under the circumstances of

           - a "SEIZED" state on all T-1 channels on either the "IN" side
             or the "OUT" side.

           - a "SEIZED", "DISABLED" and/or "NOT CONNECTED" state on any DSP
             card's port.

           - yellow or red CSU alarms or other T-1 circuit problem.

           - a card goes into alarm/fail state.

               The next parts of this section will concentrate on how to
          monitor for these problems and how to proceed when they are
          discovered.


      II.  Monitoring Primary Access Boxes

       A) Using T-1's to Monitor for Problems

               Technicians will find most problems on a box by monitoring
          each individual T-1 for problems on it's channels, each channel
          connecting to a preassigned DSP port.  To find these problems,
          the technician should do the following.

          1) Log into the desired PA box and "F10" to pull up the main
             system menu.

          2) Select the "Monitor System" menu item, enter a return, then
             hit the F4 key for all the T-1 choices on the system.  Notice
             that each T-1 list the shelf ID and AT and T circuit ID are
             listed.

          3) Up/down arrown to select the T-1 monitor followed by several
             returns.
                                                                     Page 2


               At this point, a T-1 display with all 24 channels for the
          selected T-1 should appear.  After a few seconds, it should
          update with the status of each channel.  The technician should
          monitor the selected T-1 for approximately 3 minutes to verify
          visually all ports and then move on to the next T-1 on the box
          and execute the same procedure.  The technician should be able to
          observe any existing problems listed in the "Common Problems"
          section above.  until all the T-1's on a box are observed.


       B) Searching Alarms for Problems

               When certain problems occur on a Primary Acces box, such as
          a card failing with a "red" LED, an alarm will be generated
          indicating that a problem has occurred on Primary View.

               To view alarms, a technician needs to hit the F10 key to
          pull up the main menu and select the "ALARMS" section of the
          menu.  A listing of previous alarms will display on the screen.

               If an alarm occurs while the technician is logged into the
          box, the top of the screen, no matter which menu the technician
          is in, will begin flashing.  Enter the "ALARMS" portion of the
          menu and verify what the alarm is.  New alarms will be in the
          color red.  To acknowledge the alarm, type an "A" and then answer
          "yes".

       C) Verify Alarms on Individual Cards

               There are times when an alarm will occur on a Primary Access
          box which Primary View will not record.  Specifically, this
          occurs when an alarm arises on a box and Primary View is not
          logged into it.  It is therefore incumbent on Ops.  to verify
          that there are no boards in alarm state on a system.  This is
          accomplished in the following manner.

          1) Hit the F10 key to bring up the main menu on Primary View and
             select the "Run Diagnostics" selection with the up/down arrows
             followed by a return.

          2) Hit the F4 key to bring up a list of all cards on a box and
             up/down arrow thru the whole list.  If any of the cards have a
             "*" next to it's card type, it is in alarm state and should be
             persued as described in the next session.

     III.  Problem Resolution

               Resolutions of the most common problems which occurr will be
          defined in this section.  If there is any question on how to
          proceed, always contact Netcon's FLM.  The Primary Access User
          manual in Ops will explain how to "restart" and "reload" cards as
          requested in the instructions below in the "Run Diagnostics"
          section.

       A) T-1 in a "SEIZED" state on either the "in" or "out" side on the
          T-1 Monitor display.
                                                                     Page 3


           - Open a ticket with AT and T on the circuit ID.

           - Restart card if circuit tested ok.

           - Reload card if restart failed.

           - If problem is still not resolved, send Novadyne to site to
             visually verified if T-1 card has red alarm and to also reseat
             the card.

           - If these steps still fail, notify Netcon's FLM.

       B) T-1 is showing a "yellow" or "red" alarm on the T-1 Monitor or
          other T-1 circuit problem.

                  When either of these alarm states occurs, there is a
             problem with either the AT and T circuit or one of the CSU's.
             This problem should be persued by turning the circuit over to
             AT and T and persueing as a normal circuit problem per
             established Ops procedures.

       C) DSP card has a "SEIZED" state on either the "in" or "out" side
          and/or a "NOT CONNECTED" state on the T-1 Monitor display.

           - Restart card.

           - Reload the card if the condition did not clear with the
             restart.

           - If condition has not cleared with reload or restart, sent
             Novadyne to site to visually confirm if card is in a "red"
             alarm state and to reseat card.

           - If problem still does not clear, page the FLM for further
             instructions.

       D) Card in Alarm State.

               Any card in an alarm state must be visually inspected by a
          Novadyne engineer for a "red" alarm.  Any card in an alarm state
          other than a DSP card should be considered a severity one problem

               Once a card is visually inspected, handle each type as
          follows.


          1) Ram Disk (RD) or Control Processor (CP) fails.

                  Both these cards have redundant cards in each system, so
             if one fails, an alternate will take over the failed cards
             functions.  In the cases of these two cards, open a severity
             one ticket, send out for dispatch and have the responsbile
             Netcon FLM paged.

          2) Shelf Controller (SC) fails.
                                                                     Page 4


                  This card may or may not have a redundant card to assume
             it's responsibilities upon failure.  Only those shelf's with
             more than one SC card have this redundancey.  This can be
             verified by

             - F10 to main menu and select the "run Diagnostics" item.

             - Select the "Change Board State" menu item followed by a
               return.

             - F4 to list out the cards on the system.  SC cards will be
               listed for easy identification.

                  When a SC card fails, open a severity one ticket for
             Novadyne to persue and page the responsible FLM.  If a system
             has more SC cards than shelves, the extra may be used by the
             FE to replace the bad one, whether or not it originated on the
             same shelf.  Spares from different boxes may also be swapped
             in for use.

          3) T-1 Card fails.

                  When a T-1 card goes into an alarm state, send Novadyne
             out to the site on a severity one ticket and page the
             responsible FLM.  Once FE verifies the LED, try restarting
             and/or reloading card to clear.  If fails, Novadyne will need
             to replace.

          4) DSP fails.

                  A DSP card failure should be treated the same as a T-1
             card failure, with the exception that a severity three ticket
             should be opened, not one.
