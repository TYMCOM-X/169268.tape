                  _____________________________
         
         
        
INTRODUCTION:
____________
       
     TMDT (Tymnet Multipoint Design Tool) is designed to create and
maintain least-cost line layouts for centralized subsystems which are
to be connected to the TYMNET NETWORK. With this tool TYMNET can pro-
vide prospective and actual customers of its 3270 connection with least
cost line layouts for their multipoint lines. TMDT is resident under
"ANALYSIS" on system 33. To run the program simply type
     
                   -GO (ANALYSIS)TMDT
      
     TMDT has an extremely useful built-in network editor, which will
let the user maintain and edit a file containing the locations of ter-
minals, hosts and concentrators. Please note that in our world network
nodes and concentrators are treated alike. For 3270 applications, the
node locations supporting 3270 have to be specified by the user.
       
     The program uses the minimum distance criteria to home terminals
to nodes and then uses the ESAU-WILLIAMS algorithm to design the nec-
essary number of multi-drop lines. The lines are designed based on
the user constraints as the number of locations/terminals that can be
assigned to a line and also the maximum transmit/receive traffic. Pos-
sible future enhancements to the program may include options on homing
techniques and a module to add new locations to already existing lines.
      
     TMDT supplies the user with prompts, default values, informative
messages and diagnostics wherever necessary or upon request by the user.
Useful messages are obtainable anywhere in the program by simply typing
"?". TMDT is primarily divided into two main modules. The first is a
network editor called EDIT. The second main module designs the lines
and is called DESG. The structure is as follows;

EDITOR MODULE (EDIT):
____________________
                
     The Network Editor (EDIT) provides the user with the capability
of entering and saving information about the locations in his network
including traffic to and from each node. He can also capture design
information (circuits) created by the Design Module or enter his own
circuit information to augment or override the Design Module. The Net-
work Editor provides commands to do the following functions:
        
    1). File Management........ From within the program, at any point
        the user can either input a file of nodes and links, append
        a file of nodes and links or output a file of nodes and links.
       
    2). Node Management........ The user has the capability to add nodes,
        delete nodes, modify the nodes' properties and at any point in
        the program to type out nodes and their properties.
         
    3). Link Management........ At any point in the program, the user 
        may type out any links and their properties that the Design
        Module has created. The capability to manually add and modify
        links and their properties has not been implemented in the
        current version of TMDT.
          
NETWORK EDITOR STRUCTURE:
________________________
       
      EDIT commands are hierarchically organized into logical groupings
of commands with related functions. EDIT is primarily divided into three
main modules. The first is file management called FILES. The second main
EDIT module does node management and is called NODES. The third main EDIT
module does link management and is called LINKS. The EDIT structure is as
follows;             
            
        ***********************************************************

                                                          ________
         
FILE MANAGEMENT (FILES):
_______________________
         
     Commands under file management are the following:
               
     1). IFIL <filename>     Inputs a binary file representing nodes,
                             links and properties. This command will
                             destroy a present network core image and
                             replace it with the one read from the file.
         
     2). AFIL <filename>     Appends a binary file representing nodes,
                             links and properties to the current network
                             core image.
       
     3). OFIL <filename>     Outputs a binary file representing the cur-
                             rent network core image of nodes, links and
                             properties.
               
    
NODE MANAGEMENT (NODES):
_______________________
       
     Commands under node management are the following:
        
     1). AN <node id>        Adds a node to the network core image. Only
                             a unique node id is required to add a node.
                             The program will prompt for the other pro-
                             perties like area-code/exchange where instead
                             of a value the user can enter a carriage re-
                             turn and the program uses default values.
                 
     2). DN <node id>        Deletes a specific node based on the node id
                *            or if the star option is used will delete all
                             nodes in the network core image. Note that 
                             when a node is deleted then all links inci-
                             dent to that node are also deleted.
            
     3). MN <node id>        Modifies node properties for a specific node,
            <property>       a specified group of nodes or all nodes. For
                *            example, to change a particular node's pro-
                             perties the user enters MN <node id>. After
                             which the user enters the properties to change
                             with their new values. The user could also
                             use MN * to assign new values to certain pro-
                             perties for all nodes in the network core image.
                             Even more fun is a way to identify a group of
                             nodes based on the value of specified properties
                             they have in common and assign new values to
                             specified properties for them. For example,
                             suppose the user wishes to change certain 
                             properties for all nodes with the city name
                             "NEW YORK". The user could use MN CITY and
                             the program would then prompt for a city name
                             and after that for the properties to change 
                             along with their new values.

                                                          ________  
           
     4). TN <node id>        Types node's primary properties out at the
               *             terminal. Again the star option can be used
                             when the user desires all nodes typed out.
                             Nodes primary properties are node id (no
                             keyword), area-code/exchange (keyword ACEX),
                             city (keyword CITY), state (keyword STAT),
                             number of devices (keyword DEV), receive
                             traffic (keyword RC), transmit traffic (key-
                             word TX), role (keyword ROLE), home (keyword
                             HOME) and number of terminations (keyword
                             TER). Secondary node properties are location
                             id (keyword LOC), vertical coordinate (key-
                             word VER), horizontal coordinate (keyword 
                             HOZ) and AB rate identifier (keyword AB).
                             Secondary properties are displayed in the
                             circuit report and may also be changed using
                             the modify node command (MN).
     
LINK MANAGEMENT (LINKS):
_______________________
         
     Commands under link management are the following:
               
     1). TL <endpoints>      Types out at the terminal a specific link,
            * <endpoint>     a group of links or all links. For example,
            <endpoint> *     to type out the link between node id T0001
              *    *         and node id T0002 the user would enter TL
                             and the program would prompt for an endpoint.
                             The user would then respond with the node id
                             T0001. Then the program would prompt for the
                             other endpoint and the user would respond with
                             the node id T0002.                       
        
     2). DL <endpoints>      Deletes from the network core image a specific
            * <endpoint>     link, a group of links based on a particular
            <endpoint> *     endpoint or it can be used to delete all links.
              *    *
         
     3). AL <endpoints>      This command is NOT currently implemented. If
                             it is ever added it would allow the user to
                             manually add links. The current version of 
                             TMDT only allows the design module (DESG) to
                             add links.
      
     4). ML <endpoints>     This command is also NOT currently implemented.
            * <endpoint>    If it is ever implemented it would allow the
            <endpoint> *    user to manually modify link properties.

                                                          ________
      
NODE PROPERTIES:
_______________
       
     Each node has the following properties associated with it. The
program uses keywords to reference the associated properties:
        
     Node Id (no keyword)    - A 1 to 5 character unique node identifier
                               by which the user normally refers to the
     node by. It is assigned to the node when the node is first added to
     the network core image. It can not be changed by the modify node (MN)
     command. In most of the places in the program where the node id is 
     asked for the user can usually substitute the star option ("*") which
     stands for any or all nodes.
        
     City (keyword = CITY)   - A 1 to 10 character city descriptor. When
                               the user first adds the node to the network
     core image the add node command (AN) prompts for an area-code/exchange.
     From the supplied area-code/exchange the program looks up the city,
     state, vertical coordinate and horizontal coordinate. Though TMDT
     normally fills in the city, state, V and H fields the user could if
     desired manually change these fields.                             
                                                                          
     State (keyword = STAT)  - A 2 character state code (see CITY).
            
     Area-code/exchange (keyword = ACEX) - The 6 digit area-code/exchange
                                           assigned by the telephone
     company for the node location. TMDT looks up the corresponding CITY,
     STAT, VER and HOZ values from this number.
        
     Role (keyword = ROLE)   - A node can only be one of three functional
                               types according to TMDT. Either a concen-
     trator (keyword CONC) which in our world is normally a TYMNET node;
     a terminal location (keyword TERM); or a host location (keyword HOST).
                                                                          
     Home (keyword = HOME)   - TERM and HOST locations are either assigned
                               homes by the design module (using the ASGH
     command) or they can be manually assigned using the modify node (MN)
     network editor command. Homes are the CONC nodes where lines consist-
     ing of the TERM and HOST locations are to be connected to.
         
     Location Id (keyword = LOC) - This is an advance user feature. It is
                                   a 1 to 5 character id which the user
     can assign to nodes using the modify node (MN) network editor com-
     mand. If the user assigns two or more nodes with the same location
     id then the design module will NEVER put those nodes on the same
     circuit. For reliability purposes, the design module never designs
     multipoint lines with more than one node with the same NONBLANK
     location id.
        
     Receive Traffic (keyword = RC) - Arbitrary units of traffic received 
                                      by the TERM node as assigned by the
     user. Since the units are arbitrary, the user must remember that if   
     the value for RC stands for bps for one TERM node then all other nodes
     RC field also stand for bps. Receive traffic is meaningless as far as
     CONC and HOST nodes are concern when the design module designs the
     multipoint lines.

     
                                                          Page 6.0
                                                          ________
         
     Transmit Traffic (keyword = TX) - Arbitrary units of traffic trans-
                                       mitted by the TERM node (see above
     receive traffic).                                                  
              
     Number of Devices (keyword = DEV) - The number of devices at the TERM
                                         node. This field is only meaning-
     ful for TERM nodes. The devices may actually be terminals or terminal
     control units; only the consistency of what the numbers represent must
     not be forgotten.
         
     Vertical Coordinate (keyword = VER) - Usually this field is filled in
                                           based on the area-code/exchange
     the user supplies for the node. The user can manually make this field
     any value he desires through use of the network editor modify node (MN)
     command. This can be useful when the area-code/exchange info is not
     known but the vertical and horizontal coordinates are.
       
     Horizontal Coordinate (keyword = HOZ) - See above vertical coordinate.
          
     Terminations (keyword = TER) - This field is also normally maintained
                                    by the program. When the design module
     creates lines it calculates the number of terminations the node is

     the editor modify node cammand (MN).                              
                                                                    
     A/B Indicator (keyword = AB) - This is the AT&T Rate Center identifier
                                    used for line pricing under the MPL
     tariff. Currently when a node is first added to TMDT's network core
     image it is assigned as a type "B" city. Unless the user manually
     changes this using the network editor modify node command, TMDT will
     not always design and report the least-cost topology. Instead it will
     come close by designing the least-mileage topology and report the
     possible most the design could cost under MPL tariff... and not
     its actual cost.

LINK PROPERTIES:
_______________
                
        
                 
     Each link has the following properties associated with it:
              
     Endpoints (no keyword) - Eack link is idenfified by the node ids
                              of its endpoints. 
                 
     Circuit Id (keyword = CIRC) - When the design module creates links,
                                   it assigns a 10 characircuit des-
     criptor. This circuit descriptor specifies what circuit each link is  
     on. When creating circuits the design module uses the CONC location
     node id concatenated with a sequential number as the circuit id.
          
     Length (keyword = LEN) - The billable length in air-line miles between
                              the link's endpoints.
           
     Cost (keyword = COST) - The link's MPL cost. NOTE that circuits with
                             the same length may have different costs 
     depending on their A/B types. ALSO NOTE THAT THIS IS THE MILEAGE COST
     THAT THE TELEPHONE COMPANY CHARGES UNDER MPL TARIFF. THIS IS NOT THE
     COST TYMNET CHARGES THE CUSTOMER FOR THE LINE. IF TYMNET IS CHARGING
     THE CIRCUIT BACK TO THE CUSTOMER (SAY AT 110%) THEN THE USER MUST
     MULTIPLY THE MILEAGE, TERMINATION AND POSSIBLY THE MODEM CHARGES THAT
     TMDT GIVES BY 110%.

     The following are actual scenarios with TMDT. In these scenarios,
user input will be underlined to distinguish it from system output.
Carriage returns supplied by the user will appear as a {cr}.
             
            
        
  SCENARIO # 1 :  This scenario will just show how to execute and exit

DESIGN AND ANALYSIS MODULE (DESG):
_________________________________
          
     The Design Module (DESG) can be used to plan, design and maintain
centralized subnetworks like the 3270 Tymnet Connection. The Design Module
will assign terminals and hosts to concentrator locations (like Tymnet Nodes)
according to user constraints to give the optimal cost subnetwork. The Design
Module can also be used to show the cost impact of varying the multi-drop
contraints like the maximum number of terminals to allow on any single circuit.
The Design Module provides commands to do the following functions;
            
     1). Maintain design parameters used to design and price the multi-drop
         circuits.
     
     2). Assign or reassign homing concentrator locations to all TERM and
         HOST nodes.
       
     3). Design the line layout of connecting the terminal nodes (Role = TERM)
         and host nodes (Role = HOST) to their homed concentrator nodes (Role =
         CONC).
                                     
     4). Report on the design topology and cost either as a summary or in
         detail.
          
DESIGN MODULE STRUCTURE:

     The Deisgn Module is structured as follows;

LIST PARAMETERS (LP):
____________________
       
    The Design Module (DESG) designs circuits based on parameter values,
limiting the load on circuit. The List Parameter (LP) command displays the
current values of the following parameters;
    MTRF - Maximum Traffic Per Circuit.
    MDEV - Maximum Number of Devices Per Circuit.
    MLOC - Maximum Number of Locations Per Circuit.
    PCHG - Port Charge... PCHG is used to cost out circuits but the value also
           affects the designing of circuits. The higher the PCHG the harder
           DESG tries NOT to have any point-to-point circuits.
    TFBS - Traffic Basis.                                                
    MODEM - Modem Charge .. like PCHG, MODEM is used to cost out circuits but
           the user should be aware the this parameter affects the design pro-
           cess just like PCHG.
    TOPT - Termination Option...used only for cost reporting. TOPT has
           nothing to do with the design process.
    HINT - Host Interface Charge ... used only for cost reporting. HINT has
           nothing to do with the design process.
    ACHG - Charge Per Terminal Address ... used only for cost reporting. ACHG
           has nothing to do with the design process.
            
         
MODIFY PARAMETERS (MP):
______________________
        
    the user can change the DESG parameters by using the MP command.
                 
          
ASSIGN HOMES (ASGH):
___________________
         
     DESG must be given the association of TERM nodes to CONC nodes in order
for the line layout design process. Either the user can manually use EDIT and
set the HOME property of each TERM node or DESG can be given the ASGH command
to perform the homing. If ASGH is used then DESG assigns homing CONC locations
to all TERM and HOST locations based on nearest distance. If any links exists
when ASGH is executed then the program prompts the user for permission to
delete all current links in order to continue with the homing. Many times it
is useful to let ASGH do the initial homing and then to manually use EDIT to
change some homing assignments before continueing with a line layout.

LINE LAYOUT (LL):
________________
           
    Currently this module has only one way implemented to perform line lay-
outs...REDO. REDO is used to redo the design process completely on all
nodes homed to all CONC nodes or , if specified, on all nodes homed to the
specified CONC node. REDO designs circuits one CONC location at a time. It
will delete circuits before designing new ones.
    The following are planned LL commands that hopefully will be implemented
if their need is vocalized;      
    FORC - Would allow the user to specify line segments that DESG should
           force into the final design.
    ADD  - Would allow the user to best add new locations to already existing
           designs.
    DROP - Would allow the user to drop locations from existing designs.
            
               
COST TOTALS (COST):
__________________
            
     COST gives the user cost and totals for an entire network design or for
a specified CONC node.
         
DETAIL REPORT (REP):
___________________
           
     REP gives circuit details for an entire network design, for circuits
pretaining to a specified CONC node or only the circuit that contains a
specified node id. The user has the option of saving reports to a disk file.

ESAU-WILLIAMS ALGORITHM:
_______________________
         
     DESG uses the Esau-Williams algorithm to design the line-layouts of
terminal locations associated with specified concentrator locations. This
is done under the submodule LL.
    Before the line-layout can be handled, it is first necessary to deter-
mine which TERM locations are to be associated with which CONC locations. DESG
handles this terminal clustering problem with the ASGH command. This assigns
TERM and HOST locations to their nearest CONC locations. There are other ways
to do this then simply using least distance. Eventually we hope to implement
one of the least cost solutions to this terminal clustering problem. Until then
the user may find it useful to override some of ASGH homing assignments and
manually assign homes through EDIT module.
    The following is a brief outline of the Esau-Williams algorithm and how
DESG uses it to handle each terminal cluster.
           
    STEP 0 :
                Calculate all trade off parameters.
                  Tij = Cij - Ci1 for all i,j
                and disregard all parameters > 0
         
    STEP 1 :
                Select the minimum Tij and consider connecting i to j.
         
    STEP 2 :
                Check to see if the constraints are satisfied. If yes...
                goto STEP 3. If not ... set Tij = infinity then go back to
                STEP 1 and select again.
       
    STEP 3 :
                Add link i-j; label node i with the label of node j to show
                i is connected to j. Reevaluate the constraints and update
                the trade-off parameters ... then go back to STEP 1.
            
      
Note 1:  Before STEP 0, for terminal clusters greater than 6 terminal locations
         TMDT treats the problem as a relatively sparse graph where each node
         can only connect to a small number (in our case 5) of its nearest
         neighbors and to its central. According to A.Kershenbaum and W.Chou...
         IEEE Transactions on Communications, Vol.Com-22,No.11,Nov. this does
         not significantly degrade the solution. It does however greatly im-
         prove execution time.
        
Note 2: In step 0 when calculating all the trade off parameters, TMDT checks

TMDT LINE PRICING (MPL TARIFF):
______________________________
          
    
     TMDT reports the AT&T Multischedule Private Line (MPL) tariff FCC #260
line costs. MPL tariff groups locations into two city types - TYPE A / TYPE B.
Type B cities are all small cities and account for almost all locations in the
continental United States. There are approximately 350 Type A cities, generally
the largest cities. 
     Normally a user might desire a 2400, 4800 or 9600 bps. line between two
locations. If the user gets billed from the supplying Telco under MPL pricing
then the total line cost would usually consist of mileage charges, station
termination charges and modem charges. PLEASE NOTE THAT MODEMS CHARGES ARE NOT
PART OF MPL PRICING. IF THE USER HAS HIS OWN MODEMS AND DOES NOT REQUEST ANY
FROM THE SUPPLYING TELCO THEN THE TELCO CANNOT BILL FOR THEM. ALSO NOTE THAT
IT IS THE MODEMS USED THAT DETERMINES THE SPEED OF AN ANALOG LINE. WHATEVER
THE MODEM SPEED THE LINE'S MILEAGE AND STATION CHARGES ARE THE SAME.
    The mileage charge under MPL pricing is determined by two things;
       1). The airline miles between two locations.
       2). The A/B Types of the two cities.
    
For example;
    
     Consider three lines each connecting points 2564 miles apart...which is
approximately what a line between New York City and San Francisco would be.

DESG MODULE SCENARIOS:
_____________________
       
     The following scenarios use the topology files, TERM.FIL & CONC.FIL,
defined in previous scenarios.
      
  SCENARIO # 4 : This scenario assumes the following DESG parameters. It
  ____________   is important that the user realizes how the DESG parameters
                 correspond to a related circuit response time requirement.
                 Before running TMDT the user should already know the response
                 time objective and what constraints and line speed is required
                 meet that response time. The most important thing TMDT tells
                 the user is how much that response time objective is going to
                 cost and how much could be saved by relaxing that objective
                 some. Let assume the following DESG parameters correspond to
                 an average terminal response time of 3.5 seconds and a line
                 speed of 9600 BPS. What we want from DESG is the least cost
                 configuration to obtain this 3.5 sec response time and what
                 is it going to cost.

        
     1). MTRF  = 1000   ... The Max. Traffic as the SUM of TERM locations
         TFBS  = SUM        input and output traffic will not exceed 1000
                            BPS. The TERM locations traffic are assumed to
                            also correspond to units of Bits Per Second.
                       
     2). MDEV  =   10   ... The Max. Terminal Devices allowed on any circuit
                            may not exceed 10. The actual devices do not mat-
                            ter as long as the TERM locations are expressed
                            as so many equivalent devices. The actual physical
                            devices may be a mix of terminals, terminal control
                            units, printers, card readers, etc. For example,
                            the user may express a physical printer as being
                            equivalent to 5 terminals to TMDT.
    
     3). MLOC  =   10   ... The Max. Number of Locations allowed on any circuit
                            may not exceed 10.

     4). PCHG  = 250.00 ... The Port Charge here of $250.00 correspond to the
                            Tymnet charge that Tymnet charges a customer for
                            use of a 9600 bps port.
                  
     5). MODEM = 354.00 ... The Modem Charge here of $354.00 correspond to the
                            monthly leased charge for a Bell provided 9600 BPS
                            modem.           
     
     6). TOPT  =   S    ... The Termination Option here of "S" means that when
                            computing termination charges, TMDT will price out
                            one termination per location. The only other alter-
                            native would be "M" which means to charge each
                            TERM device a seperate termination charge.
        
     7). HINT = 1300.00 ... The Host Interface Charge here of $1300.00 cor-
                            respond to the charge Tymnet imposes .
       
     8). ACHG =   40.00 ... The Charge Per Terminal Address here of $40.00
                            correspond to a Tymnet imposed charge.

SUMMARY:
_______
 
   The preceeding pages showed how TMDT is used to configure multi-drop
circuits. Now let's summarize the steps we preformed on the preceeding
pages.
        
   INPUTS:
   ______
         
     1). Notify TMDT of the Tymnet locations supporting 3270. Call these
         locations "CONC" locations to the program.
      
     2). Notify TMDT of the terminal locations with their associated traffic
         and number of devices. Call these locations "TERM" locations to the
         program.
            
     3). Notify TMDT of the host locations. Call these locations "HOST" to
         the program.
       
     4). Notify TMDT's DESG module of what constraints and cost parameters
         to use while configuring circuits. 
      
        
   EXECUTION:
   _________
     
     1). Make sure the above inputs are reflected in TMDT's memory. This
         is done by using the EDIT command TN (type node) and the DESG
         command LP (list parameters).
      
     2). Use the DESG command ASGH (assign homes) in most cases. Only
         when the user manually takes care of the homing is ASGH unneces-
         sary.
     
     3). Use the DESG module LL (line layout) and REDO ( redo circuit con-
         figurations) to configure circuits.
     
   
OUTPUTS:
_______
     
     1). Save the network configuration to a report file for later review.
         This is accomplished by using the DESG module REP (report) command.
     
NOTES:
_____
     
     1). Currently Tymnet charges 3270 customers back for the Telephone   
         company related charges for terminal circuits. Hence in our
         scenarios the related LINE, DROP and MODEM charges would be billed
         back to the TYMNET customer at 110%. Hence before reporting the
         TMDT charges back to the customer, the associated Telephone Charges
         must be multiplied by 1.10. 
     
     2). Tymnet charges a fixed charge for the HOST circuit... based on line
         speed. Hence Telephone Company charges, modem charges and port
         charges are not included in TMDT's report for HOST circuits.
      
     3). TMDT only reports recurring charges. Before quoting a proposal the
         user should manually compute the installation charges associated
         with the configuration.
      
     4). TMDT does not include such things as conditioning. Hence if the 
         user knows that each circuit TMDT configured will need condition-
         ing then the additional charges for conditioning must be added
         manually.
