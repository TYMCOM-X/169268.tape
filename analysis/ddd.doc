                           -----------------

                              MARCH, 1983
                       PREPARED BY: JO ANN JOELS

                            I.  INTRODUCTION
                            ----------------


        THE DDD PROGRAM (DIRECT DISTANCE DIALING) HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO
        HELP THE USER DETERMINE THE COST OF ACCESSING THE TYMNET NETWORK
        THROUGH AN ATT LONG DISTANCE CALL.  THIS PROGRAM TAKES A GIVEN
        SET OF POTENTIAL TERMINAL LOCATIONS, FINDS THE NEAREST TYMNET
        CITY, APPLIES APPROPRIATE TARIFFS, AND OUTPUTS THE COST OF THE
        CONNECTION FROM THE TERMINAL LOCATIONS TO THE NEAREST TYMNET
        CITIES (THE DDD COST).

        NOTE: THE DDD PROGRAM CAN NOT BE USED FOR TERMINAL LOCATIONS
              OUTSIDE OF THE CONTINENTAL 48 STATES.






                             II.  DDD COSTS
                             --------------



        DEPENDING ON THE LOCATIONS OF THE TERMINAL CITY AND THE TYMNET
        CITY, A CALL PLACED BETWEEN THE TWO CAN BE CATEGORIZED AS BEING
        (1) A LOCAL OR MESSAGE UNIT CALL (2) A LONG DISTANCE INTRASTATE
        CALL, OR (3) A LONG DISTANCE INTERSTATE CALL.

        IN CASE (1), A CALL IS ASSUMED BY THE PROGRAM TO BE A LOCAL OR
        MESSAGE UNIT CALL IF THE CALL IS INTRASTATE AND THE DISTANCE
        BETWEEN THE TERMINAL LOCATION AND THE TYMNET CITY IS LESS THAN
        15 MILES.  IN SOME CASES THIS ASSUMPTION IS FALSE AND  CAN BE
        OVERRIDDEN.  THE PROCEDURE FOR OVERRRIDING THIS ASSUMPTION IS
        DESCRIBED IN SECTION X EXAMPLE II.

        IN CASE (2), A CALL IS ASSUMED BY THE PROGRAM TO BE AN
        INTRASTATE CALL IF THE TERMINAL LOCATION AND THE TYMNET CITY ARE
        IN THE SAME STATE ACCORDING TO THE V&H DATA BASE.

        IN CASE (3), A CALL IS ASSUMED BY THE PROGRAM TO BE AN
        INTERSTATE CALL IF THE TERMINAL LOCATION AND THE TYMNET CITY ARE
        IN DIFFERENT STATES ACCORDING TO THE V&H DATA BASE OR IF EITHER
        THE STATE OF THE TERMINAL LOCATION OR THE STATE OF THE TYMNET
        CITY IS NOT IN THE V&H DATA BASE.  THIS ASSUMPTION MAY ALSO BE
        OVERRIDDEN.  SEE SECTION X EXAMPLE II.                                                              Page  2   



                           III.  TYMNET COSTS
                           ------------------



        THE COST OF THE CONNECTION THROUGH TYMNET TO THE USER'S HOST
        DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE TYMNET CITY IN WHICH THE CONNECTION
        ORIGNATES IS CLASSIFIED AS (1) HIGH DENSITY, (2) MEDIUM DENSITY,
        (3) LOW DENSITY OR (4) WATS.  THE CLASSIFICATION OF A CITY AS
        HIGH DENSITY, MEDIUM DENSITY, OR LOW DENSITY, IS CONTAINED IN
        THE FILE: NODE.LOC.

        IF THE DDD COST PLUS THE TYMNET COST OF A CONNECTION BETWEEN TWO
        CITIES IS GREATER THAN THE TYMNET CHARGE FOR A WATS CONNECTION
        BETWEEN THOSE TWO CITIES, THE PROGRAM WILL SUGGEST THE USAGE OF
        WATS.


        NOTE: THE TYMNET COST IS BASED ON CHARGES FOR LESS THAN 1000
              HOURS PER MONTH AT PEAK RATE: NO DISCOUNTS ARE APPLIED.






                         IV.  1200 BAUD SERVICE
                         ----------------------



        NORMALLY THE DDD PROGRAM SELECTS THE TYMNET LOCATION CLOSEST TO
        A TERMINAL LOCATION, HOWEVER, IF THE USER HAS SPECIFIED THAT
        1200 BAUD SERVICE IS REQUIRED, THE PROGRAM WILL SELECT THE
        CLOSEST TYMNET LOCATION WITH 1200 BAUD SERVICE AVAILABLE.                                                              Page  3   



                        V.  RUNNING THE PROGRAM
                         ----------------------





        TO RUN THE DDD PROGRAM THE USER TYPES:

        - RUN (ANALYSIS)DDD

        THE USER WILL THEN BE PROMPTED FOR THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION.

     *  "ENTER NETWORK DESCRIPTOR FILENAME (CR FOR TYMNET)"

        ENTER THE FILE NAME OF THE FILE CONTAINING THE DESCRIPTION OF A
        NETWORK OTHER THAN TYMNET OR ENTER A CARRIAGE RETURN IF
        TERMINALS ARE TO BE CONNECTED TO TYMNET.  SEE SECTION VIII FOR
        THE STRUCTURE OF THE DESCRIPTOR FILE.



     *  "ENTER EXPANSION CITY DESCRIPTOR FILENAME (CR OR NONE) "

        ENTER THE FILE NAME OF A FILE CONTAINING A LIST OF EXPANSION
        CITIES FOR TYMNET.  IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO INCLUDE THE EXPANSION
        CITIES, THEN ENTER A CARRIAGE RETURN.  SEE SECTION VIII FOR THE
        STRUCTURE OF THE EXPANSION CITY DESCRIPTOR FILE.


     *  "ELIMINATE ACCESS TO LOW DENSITY CITIES? (Y OR N) "

        IN SOME APPLICATIONS LOW DENSITY CITIES ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE
        ACCESS POINTS TO THE NETWORK.  IF LOW DENSITY CITIES ARE
        UNACCEPTABLE ENTER A 'Y', OTHERWISE, ENTER A 'N'.



     *  "ENTER TRAFFIC FILE NAME: "

        BEFORE RUNNING THE DDD PROGRAM IT IS NECESSARY TO CREATE A DISK
        FILE THAT CONTAINS INFORMATION ABOUT EACH POTENTIAL TERMINAL
        LOCATION THAT YOU WANT CONNECTED TO THE NETWORK.  THIS FILE
        CONTAINS THE LOCATION OF THE TERMINAL, WHETHER OR NOT 1200 BAUD
        SERVICE IS REQUIRED, THE NUMBER OF CALLS PER MONTH FROM THE
        TERMINAL LOCATION, AND THE AVERAGE HOLD TIME OF THE CALLS, PLUS
        SOME OTHER OPTIONAL INFORMATION.  FOR A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF
        THE TRAFFIC FILE SEE SECTION VII.



     *  "IS TRAFFIC ENTERED BY 1.AREACODE,PREFIX OR 2. V&H"

        IN THE TRAFFIC FILE THE LOCATION OF EACH TERMINAL CAN BE
        SPECIFIED IN ONE OF TWO WAYS, EITHER BY GIVING THE AREA CODE AND                                                              Page  4   



        PREFIX OF THE LOCATION OR BY GIVING THE VERTICAL (V) AND
        HORIZONTAL (H) COORDINATES ASSIGNED TO THE LOCATION BY AT&T.  IF
        IN YOUR TRAFFIC FILE YOU'VE SPECIFIED THE LOCATIONS OF THE
        TERMINALS BY AREA CODE AND PREFIX ENTER A '1'.  IF IN THE
        TRAFFIC FILE YOU'VE SPECIFIED THE LOCATIONS OF THE TERMINALS BY
        V&H, ENTER A '2'.



     *  "ENTER OUTPUT FILE NAME (C.R. FOR TERMINAL): "

        THE OUTPUT FROM THE DDD PROGRAM MAY BE DIRECTED EITHER TO A DISK
        FILE OR TO THE TERMINAL.  TO DIRECT THE OUTPUT TO A DISK FILE
        ENTER A FILE NAME, OTHERWISE ENTER A CARRIAGE RETURN AND THE
        OUTPUT WILL BE ISSUED TO THE TERMINAL.  THE USER SHOULD ALWAYS
        SET THE TERMINAL WIDTH TO 80 CHARACTERS;

             - TTY WIDTH 80

        BEFORE TYPING THE OUTPUT FILE OR, IF THE OUTPUT IS TO THE
        TERMINAL, BEFORE RUNNING THE DDD PROGRAM.



     *  " INCLUDE DETAILED COST BREAKDOWN IN OUTPUT? (Y OR N): "

        THERE ARE TWO OUTPUT FORMATS AVAILABLE TO THE USER. ONE INCLUDES
        COST INFORMATION (COST OF MINIMUM CONNECT, COST OF EACH
        ADDITIONAL MINUTE, COST PER CALL, ETC.) FOR EACH ENTRY IN THE
        TRAFFIC FILE, THE OTHER OUTPUT FORMAT DOES NOT INCLUDE COST
        INFORMATION.  IF YOU WANT COST INFORMATION ENTER A 'Y' AT THE
        PROMPT, IF NOT, ENTER A 'N'.  IF A 'N' IS ENTERED COST
        INFORMATION IS ALSO EXCLUDED FROM THE SUMMARY INFORMATION
        PRINTED AT THE END OF THE PROGRAM OUTPUT.                                                              Page  5   



                  VI.  OTHER INPUT TO THE DDD PROGRAM
                  -----------------------------------



        BESIDES THE INPUT FROM THE USER (DESCRIBED IN SECTION V), THE
        DDD PROGRAM ALSO USES INFORMATION FROM THE FOLLOWING FILES.
        THESE FILES ARE MAINTAINED BY THE MANAGEMENT SCIENCES GROUP AND
        SHOULD NOT BE CHANGED BY ANYONE ELSE.

        1.  NODE.LOC, A FILE CONTAINING ALL THE NECESSARY DETAILS ABOUT
                      EXISTING TYMNET LOCATIONS.

        2.  TELNOD.LOC, A FILE CONTAINING ALL THE NECESSARY DETAILS
                        ABOUT EXISTING TELENET LOCATIONS.

        3.  UNINOD.LOC, A FILE CONTAINING ALL THE NECESSARY DETAILS
                        ABOUT EXISTING UNINET LOCATIONS.

        4.  VH.DMS, A DATA BASE CONTAINING THE AREA CODE, PREFIX, NAME,
                    VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL COORDINATES OF APPROXI-
                    MATELY 36,000 LOCATIONS IN THE U.S.A. AND CANADA.

        5.  INTRA.TAR, A FILE CONTAINING THE DETAILS OF INTRA-STATE
                       TARIFFS FOR ALL THE STATES IN THE U.S.

        6.  INTER.TAR, A FILE CONTAINING THE DETAILS OF INTER-STATE
                       TARIFFS IN THE U.S.

        7.  ACODE.DAT, A FILE CONTAINING THE DESCRIPTION OF AREA CODES
                       IN EACH STATE IN THE U.S.

        8.  TYMNET.TAR, A FILE CONTAINING THE DETAILS OF THE TYMNET
                        TARIFF.

        9.  DDD.MSG  , A FILE CONTAINING THE MESSAGE PRINTED EACH TIME
                       THE DDD PROGRAM IS RUN.                                                              Page  6   



                    VII.  CREATING THE TRAFFIC FILE
                    -------------------------------




        THE TRAFFIC FILE SHOULD BE CREATED IN EDITOR AND ONE ENTRY (ONE
        LINE) SHOULD BE CREATED FOR EACH TERMINAL LOCATION.  EACH ENTRY
        MUST CONTAIN THE FIRST FOUR PIECES OF INFORMATION LISTED BELOW
        IN THE ORDER GIVEN.  THE OVERRIDE FLAG IS OPTIONAL.



     *  WHETHER OR NOT 1200 BAUD SERVIDE IS REQUIRED IN THE TYMNET CITY.
        IF 1200 BAUD SERVICE IS REQUIRED AN "H" SHOULD BE ENTERED AS THE
        FIRST CHARACTER IN THE ENTRY.  IF 1200 BAUD SERVICE IS NOT
        REQUIRED AN "L" SHOULD BE ENTERED AS THE FIRST CHARACTER IN THE
        ENTRY.  NOTE:  THIS 1200 BAUD FLAG IS NOT FOLLOWED BY A COMMA.



     *  TERMINAL LOCATION.  THE TERMAINAL LOCATION CAN BE SPECIFIED IN
        TO WAYS, EITHER BY AREA CODE AND PREFIX, OR BY V&H.  HOWEVER,
        ALL LOCATIONS WITHIN ONE TRAFFIC FILE MUST BE SPECIFIED IN THE
        SAME WAY.  IF ENTERING AREA CODE AND PREFIX, ENTER THE AREA CODE
        , A COMMA, THE PREFIX, AND ANOTHER COMMA.  IF ENTERING V&H,
        ENTER THE V COORDINATE, A COMMA, THE H COORDINATE, AND ANOTHER
        COMMA.

     *  THE NUMBER OF CALLS PER MONTH ORIGINATING IN EACH TERMINAL
        LOCATION.  FOLLOW THIS NUMBER BY A COMMA.

     *  THE AVERAGE HOLD TIME IN SECONDS OF EACH CALL ORIGINATING IN THE
        TERMINAL LOCATION.  FOLLOW THIS NUMBER BY A COMMA.

     *  OVERRIDE FLAG.  (OPTIONAL) THE DDD PROGRAM ASSUMES THAT IF THE
        DISTANCE BETWEEN A CALLING LOCATION AND THE TYMNET CITY IS LESS
        THAN 15 MILES AND THE TWO LOCATIONS ARE IN THE SAME STATE THAT
        THE CALL IS A LOCAL CALL.  IN SOME CASES THE USER MAY WISH TO
        OVERRIDE THIS ASSUMPTION AND MAKE THE CALL A MEASURED CALL.  TO
        DO THIS HE SETS THE OVERRIDE FLAG TO 'T' FORCING THE CALL TO BE
        A TOLL CALL.  IN DOING THIS THE USER MUST THEN SUPPLY THE TOLL
        RATES FOR THIS CALL.  THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT IS NEEDED
        IS DESCRIBED IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH.  THE DDD PROGRAM ALSO
        ASSUMES THAT IF THE TERMINAL LOCATION AND THE TYMNET CITY ARE IN
        DIFFERENT STATES THAT THE CALL BETWEEN THE TWO WILL BE AN
        INTERSTATE LONG DISTANCE CALL. IN SOME CASES THIS IS NOT TRUE
        AND THE USER MAY WANT TO OVERRDIE THIS ASSUMPTION AND MAKE THE
        CALL A LOCAL CALL.  TO DO THIS HE SETS THE OVERRIDE FLAG TO 'L'
        FORCING THE CALL TO BE A LOCAL CALL.  NO ADDITIIONAL INFORMATION
        IS NEEDED WHEN THE OVERRRIDE FLAG IS SET TO 'L'.  NOTE:  THIS
        FLAG IS NOT FOLLOWED BY A COMMA.

     *  FORCED TOLL CALL RATES.  IF THE USER SETS THE OVERRIDE FLAG TO
        'T', FORCING A TOLL CALL BETWEEN THE TERMINAL LOCATION AND THE                                                              Page  7   



        NEAREST TYMNET LOCATION, THEN HE MUST ENTER THE FOLLOWING RATE
        INFORMATION.

        1.  MINIMUM BILLABLE TIME IN MINUTES.

        2.  MINIMUM RATE IN DOLLARS

        3.  RATE IN DOLLARS OF EACH ADDITIONAL MINUTE.

        THESE RATES ARE USUALLY OBTAINED FROM THE DDD PROGRAM.  IN A
        TYPICAL SITUATION, A USER WILL SET UP HIS TRAFFIC FILE AND RUN
        THE DDD PROGRAM.  WHEN LOOKING AT THE OUTPUT FROM THE RUN HE
        NOTICES THAT SOME CALLS THAT ARE DESIGNATED LOCAL SHOULD NOT BE.
        HOWEVER, EVEN THOUGH THE DDD PROGRAM CONSIDERS A CALL LOCAL, IT
        STILL OUTPUTS THE MEASURED CALL RATES.  THE USER CAN USE THESE
        RATES TO CHANGE HIS TRAFFIC FILE AND THEN RERUN THE DDD PROGRAM.
        FOR A COMPLETE EXAMPLE OF THIS SEE SECTION X EXAMPLE II.



        EXAMPLE:

        H202,737,500,360,T1,.18,.08

        GIVEN THE ABOVE ENTRY THE DDD PROGRAM WILL FIND THE NEAREST
        TYMNET CITY WITH 1200 BAUD SERVICE TO AREA CODE 202, PREFIX 737
        (SOMERVILLE, N.J.).  IT WILL CALCULATE THE COST PER CALL OF 500
        CALLS WITH AN AVERAGE HOLD TIME OF 6 MINUTES WITH THE FORCED
        TOLL RATE OF: A 1 MINUTE MINUMUM CONNECT COSTING 18 CENTS AND
        EACH ADDITIONAL MINUTE COSTING 8 CENTS.                                                              Page  8   



             VIII.  DESCRIPTION OF NETWORK DESCRIPTOR FILE
                  (AND EXPANSION CITY DESCRIPTOR FILE)
             ---------------------------------------------



        THE NETWORK DESCRIPTOR FILE MUST BE A SYMBOLIC FILE.  EACH LINE
        IN THE FILE SHOULD DESCRIBE AN ENTRY POINT INTO THE NETWORK.
        EACH LINE MUST CONTAIN THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IN THE ORDER
        LISTED BELOW.


     *  CITY CODE.  THIS IS A LETTER DESIGNATING THE ENTRY POINT AS:
        "H" = HIGH DENSITY; "M" = MEDIUM DENSITY; "L" = LOW DENSITY.
        THE CITY CODE IS NOT FOLLOWED BY A COMMA.



     *  PHONE NUMBER.  THE PHONE NUMBER TO BE USED TO ACCESS THE NETWORK
        ENTRY POINT.  ENTER IN FORMAT AAA-PPP-NNNN WHERE AAA= AREA CODE;
        PPP=PREFIX; AND NNNN=NUMBER.  THE PHONE NUMBER MUST BE FOLLOWED
        BY A COMMA.



     *  1200 BAUD SERVICE FLAG - SET TO AN "!" IF 1200 BAUD SERVICE IS
        AVAILABLE IN THE ENTRY POINT CITY. OTHERWISE THE FLAG IS LEFT
        BLANK.


     *  CITY NAME.  A 15 CHARACETER NAME FOR THE CITY IN WHICH THE ENTRY
        POINT TO THE NETWORK RESIDES.


        EXAMPLE:

        THE FOLLOWING NETWORK DESCRIPTIOR FILE DESCRIBES A NETWORK WITH
        3 ENTRY POINTS.

        H301-547-8100,!BALTIMORE
        L512-444-5800, AUSTIN
        M415-348-4992, BURLINGAME

        THE 1ST LINE DESCRIBES A HIGH DENSITY ENTRY POINT WITH 1200 BAUD
        SERVICE IN BALTIMORE MARYLAND.   THE 2ND LINE DESCRIBES A LOW
        DENSITY ENTRY POINT WITHOUT 1200 BAUD SERVICE IN AUSTIN TEXAS.
        THE 3RD LINE DESCRIBES A MEDIUM DENSITY ENTRY POINT WITHOUT 1200
        BAUD SERVICE IN BURLINGAME CALIFORNIA.                                                              Page  9   



                          IX.  PROGRAM OUTPUT
                          -------------------



        AS THE PROGRAM PROCESSES EACH POTENTIAL TERMINAL LOCATION IT
        OUTPUTS THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION.


        ABOUT THE TERMINAL LOCATION CALLING CITY
        ----------------------------------------

     .  WHETHER OR NOT THE CITY REQUIRES 1200 BAUD SERVICE
        ( "H" = 1200 REQUIRED. "L" = 1200 NOT REQUIRED.)

     .  THE AREA CODE AND PREFIX

     .  THE CITY AND STATE NAME

                EXAMPLE:

                      CALLING CITY

                H602,774FLAGSTAFF ,AZ


        ABOUT THE NEAREST ENTRY POINT TO THE NETWORK
        --------------------------------------------


     .  WHETHER OR NOT 1200 BAUD SERVICE IS AVAILABLE (! = AVAILABLE)

     .  THE CITY NAME

     .  WHETHER THE CITY IS HIGH, MEDIUM, OR LOW DENSITY

     .  THE ACCESS PHONE NUMBER

     .  THE NUMBER OF MILES BETWEEN THE TERMINAL LOCATION AND THE ENTRY
        POINT


                EXAMPLE:


                NEAREST LOCATION  PHONE NO.  MILES

                 !PHOENIX        L602-254-5811 123                                                              Page 10   



        ABOUT THE DDD COST     (OPTIONAL - SEEN ONLY IN DETAILED COST
        ------------------      OUTPUT FORMAT)


     .  MINIMUM CONNECT TIME IN MINUTES (MM)

     .  CHARGE IN DOLLARS OF MINIMUM CONNECT TIME (MC)

     .  CHARGE IN DOLLARS OF EACH ADDITIONAL MINUTE (CM)

     .  COST PER CALL FROM THE TERMINAL LOCATION TO THE NETWORK (CC)
        ENTRY POINT

     .  COST/MONTH IN DOLLARS OF ALL CALLS (COST)


                EXAMPLE:

                --------DDD COST--------
                 MM  MC   CM   CC   COST

                 1  .46  .30  1.96 22000


        NOTE:  IF COST = LOC/M THIS INDICATES THE CALL IS EITHER A LOCAL
        OR MESSAGE UNIT CALL AND THE DDD PROGRAM CONSIDERS THE DDD COST
        TO BE ZERO.  HOWEVER, IN CITIES WHERE LOCAL CALLS ARE MEASURED
        AND CHARGED FOR THE USER SHOULD ADD THIS COST TO HIS ANALYSIS.
        ALSO, IF MILEAGE IS ZERO, MEANING THAT THE TERMINAL LOCATION HAS
        THE SAME AREA CODE AND PREFIX AS THE NETWORK ENTRY POINT CITY,
        THEN THE TARIFF RATES CAN NOT BE DETERMINED AND ARE OUTPUT AS
        ZEROS.



        FLAGS
        -----

        AT THE END OF EACH ENTRY ONE OF THE FOLLOWING FLAGS MAY APPEAR.

        "*" = CALL IS INTRA-STATE

        "W" = SUGGESTS WATS BE USED.  IF THIS FLAG APPEARS , THE DDD
              COST IS THE TYMNET WATS COST BUT THE TARIFF RATES ARE THE
              DDD RATES.

        "LC" = INDICATES  CALL IS LOCAL OR MULTIMESSAGE.  SEEN ONLY IN
               OUTPUT FORMAT WHICH EXCLUDES COST INFORMATION.

        "X"  = INDICATES THE CALL CAN NOT BE PRICED WITH THE DDD TARIFF.
               THIS RESULTS WHEN THE ATT V & H CO-ORDINATES ARE ZERO FOR
               THE CALLING LOCATION (LOCATION IS NOT IN CONTINENTAL
               U.S.), OR IF THE CALLING LOCATION IS IN ALASKA.

THE USER WANTS TO ADD THE FOLLOWING LOCATIONS TO TYMNET.  EACH ONE HAS
10,000 CALLS PER MONTH, AN AVERAGE HOLD TIME OF 6 MINUTES, AND REQUIRES
1200 BAUD SERVICE.

THE USER CREATES A FILE CONTAINING THE AREA CODES AND PREFIXES OF ALL
THESE LOCATIONS.  SEE THE PRINTOUT OF FILE TRAFF.TST ON THE NEXT PAGE.
THEN HE RUNS THE PROGRAM DDD AND SUPPLIES THE NAME OF THE TRAFFIC FILE
WHICH IS TRAFF.TST.  HERE IS AN EXAMPLE IN INTERPRETING THE OUTPUT.

THE NEAREST TYMNET CITY FROM FLAGSTAFF, ARIZONA IS PHOENIX, ARIZONA,
WHICH IS A HIGH-DENSITY CITY WITH PHONE NUMBER 602/254-5811.  PHOENIX IS
123 MILES FROM FLAGSTAFF.  SINCE BOTH THE LOCATIONS ARE IN ARIZONA, THE
ARIZONA INTRA-STATE TARIFF APPLIES.  THE APPLICABLE DDD TARIFF IS:

        1 MINUTE MINIMUM CONNECT TIME
        $.46 FOR THE FIRST MINUTE
        $.30 FOR EACH ADDITIONAL MINUTE

FOR A PRICE PER CALL OF $1.96.  HOWEVER, THE PROGRAM HAS DETERMINED THAT
WATS WOULD BE LESS EXPENSIVE , THEREFORE THE COST LISTED IS THE WATS
COST AND THE OUTPUT LINE FOR FLAGSTAFF IS ENDED WITH A 'W' TO SUGGEST
WATS USAGE.


NOTE:  IF THE POTENTIAL TERMINAL LOCATION AND THE CLOSEST TYMNET
        LOCATION ARE THE SAME, ALL DDD COST FIGURES ARE SET AT 0.                                                              Page 14   



THE FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF THE TRAFF.TST TRAFFIC FILE AND THE OUTPUT
FROM THE DDD PROGRAM USING THIS TRAFFIC FILE.  ALL USER TYPED
INFORMATION IS UNDERLINED.  TWO EXAMPLES OF THE OUTPUT FROM THE DDD

SUPPOSE YOU HAVE AN APPLICATION IN WHICH TWO OF THE CALLING LOCATIONS
ARE SILVER SPRING, MD. AND CATONSVILLE, MD. EACH WITH 10,000 CALLS PER
MONTH, AN AVERAGE HOLD TIME OF 6 MINUTES, AND REQUIRES 1200 BAUD
SERVICE.  THE INPUT LINES FOR THESE LOCATIONS IN THE TRAFFIC FILE WOULD
APPEAR AS FOLLOWS:

        H301,891,10000,360
        H301,744,10000,360

FROM THE PROGRAM OUTPUT (SEE CASE-A OUTPUT) YOU CAN SEE THAT THE NEAREST
LOCATION TO SILVER SPRING, MD IN TYMNET IS WASHINGTON D.C.  WHICH IS 10
MILES AWAY.  THE PROGRAM COMPUTES AND OUTPUTS THE INTER-STATE TARIFF.
THE NEAREST LOCATION TO CATONSVILLE, MD. IS BALTIMORE, MD. WHICH IS 8
MILES AWAY.  THE PROGRAM IN THIS CASE ASSUMES A LOCAL CALL.  LET US SAY
YOU WANT TO OVERRIDE THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE BY THE PROGRAM AND WANT TO

A.      MAKE THE CALL BETWEEN SILVER SPRING, MD. AND WASHINGTON D.C.  A
        LOCAL CALL

        AND

B.      MAKE THE CALL FROM CATONSVILLE TO BALTIMORE A MEASURED CALL WITH
        MINIMUM CONNECT = 1 MINUTE; FIRST MINUTE = $.19; AND EACH
        ADDITIONAL MINUTE = $.09.

YOU CAN MODIFY THE TRAFFIC FILE AS FOLLOWS:
