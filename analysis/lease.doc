                          -------------------


                            I.  INTRODUCTION
                            ----------------





        THE LEASE PROGRAM COMPUTES THE COST OF A LEASED LINE BETWEEN TWO
        POINTS.  GIVEN A PAIR OF AREA CODES AND PREFIXES, THE CHOICE OF
        BAND WIDTH AND TYPE OF CIRCUIT (DDS OR ANALOG), THE PROGRAM
        COMPUTES THE MILEAGE CHARGES, MODEM/TERMINATION CHARGES AND THE
        ONE TIME INSTALLATION CHARGES BASED ON THE CURRENT AT&T TARIFFS.
        IN THE CASE OF SOME SHORT INTRA-CITY CIRCUITS, SLIGHT
        INACCURACIES MAY ARISE DUE TO THE FACT THAT SOME LOCAL TELEPHONE
        COMPANIES CHARGE DIFFERENT RATES FROM AT&T.







                     II.  THE ATT LEASE LINE TARIFF
                     ------------------------------



        THE ANALOG TARIFF FOR LEASED LINES CLASSIFIES ALL CITIES AS
        EITHER CLASS-A OR CLASS-B CITIES.  THE COST OF A LEASED LINE IS
        DEPENDENT ON WHETHER THE LINE IS BETWEEN (A) TWO CLASS-A CITIES,
        (B) A CLASS-A AND A CLASS-B CITY, OR (C) TWO CLASS-B CITIES.
        WITHIN EACH OF THE THREE CATEGORIES THE CHARGES ARE FURTHER
        DEPENDENT ON THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO CITIES.  A DETAILED
        LISTING OF THE ATT TARIFF IS LOCATED UNDER (TARFDMS)BELL.TAR.                                                              Page  2   



                       III.  RUNNING THE PROGRAM
                       -------------------------



        THE LEASE PROGRAM IS VERY SIMPLE TO RUN.  THE USER JUST TYPES:

        - TTY WIDTH 80

        - RUN (ANALYSIS)LEASE.ATT

        THE USER WILL THEN BE PROMPTED WITH:


        "ENTER INPUT FILE NAME "

        BEFORE RUNNING THE LEASE.ATT PROGRAM IT IS NECESSARY TO CREATE A
        DISC FILE THAT CONTAINS THE INFORMATION THE PROGRAM NEEDS ABOUT
        EACH LINE IT IS TO DETERMINE THE COST OF LEASING.  SECTION V
        GIVES A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF THIS INPUT FILE.

        "DETAILED COST BREAKDOWN? (Y OR N): "

        IT IS SOMETIMES VERY USEFUL TO HAVE THE CHARGES BROKEN DOWN INTO
        CATEGORIES OF: STATION TERMINATION CHARGES, MODEM/DSU CHARGES,
        AND CONDITIONING CHARGES.  IF A 'Y' IS ENTERED AT THIS PROMPT
        THE PROGRAM WILL BREAKDOWN THE CHARGES FOR YOU.  HOWEVER, THIS
        TAKES 10 TO 12 LINES OF OUTPUT PER CIRCUIT.  SECTION VIII
        DISPLAYS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS DETAILED OUTPUT.  IF A 'N' IS
        ENTERED AT THIS PROMPT THE OUTPUT TAKES ONLY ONE LINE PER
        CIRCUIT.  THIS IS REFERRED TO AS STANDARD OUTPUT.  SECTION VII
        DISPLAYS AN EXAMPLE OF THE STANDARD OUTPUT.

        A TOTALS SECTION IS OUTPUT AFTER THE CHARGES FOR EACH CIRCUIT
        HAVE BEEN DISPLAYED.                                                              Page  3   



               IV.  OTHER INPUT TO THE LEASE.ATT PROGRAM
               -----------------------------------------



        BESIDES THE USER CREATED INPUT FILE THE LEASE.ATT PROGRAM USES
        INFORMATION FROM THE FOLLOWING FILES.


        1.  VH.DMS      A DATA BASE CONTAINING THE AREA CODE, PREFIX,
                        NAME, VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL COORDINATES OF
                        APPROXIMATELY 36,000 LOCATIONS IN THE U.S.A. AND
                        CANADA.

        2.  CLASSA.DMS  A DATA BASE CONTAINING THE CITY AND STATE NAMES
                        OF ALL CITIES CLASSIFIED AS CLASS-A BY AT&T.

        3.  LEASE.MSG   A FILE CONTAINING THE MESSAGE PRINTED AT THE
                        BEGINNING OF THE PROGRAM.                                                              Page  4   



                      V.  CREATING THE INPUT FILE
                      ---------------------------



        THE INPUT FILE IS CREATED IN EDITOR AND SHOULD CONTAIN ONE ENTRY
        FOR EACH LINE YOU WANT THE COST OF LEASING.  THE FOLLOWING
        PIECES OF INFORMATION MUST APPEAR IN EACH ENTRY AND MUST APPEAR
        IN THE ORDER GIVEN BELOW.


     *  AREA CODE AND PREFIX OF CITY AT ONE END OF THE LINE.

     *  AREA CODE AND PREFIX OF CITY AT OTHER END OF THE LINE.

     *  BAND WIDTH. VALID VALUES ARE: 2400,4800,9600,56KB

     *  TYPE OF CIRCUIT.  THE VALID VALUES ARE:

                DDS = DIGITAL

                ANA = ANALOG

        IF THE TYPE OF CIRCUIT IS LEFT BLANK, "ANA" IS ASSUMED.  A 56KB
        ANALOG CIRCUIT DOES NOT EXIST. THEREFORE, ALL 56KB CIRCUITS ARE
        ASSUMED TO BE "DDS".


     *  TYPE OF EQUIPMENT.  ALL DDS LINES MUST USE ATT PROVIDED
        EQUIPMENT. HOWEVER, IT IS PERMITTED FOR CUSTOMERS TO PROVIDE
        EQUIPMENT ON 4800 AND 9600 BAUD ANALOG LINES.  THE VALID VALUES
        ARE:

                ATT = ATT PROVIDED EQUIPMENT

                CPE = CUSTOMER PROVIDED EQUIPMENT

        IF CPE IS SPECIFIED FOR A DDS LINE THE PROGRAM IGNORES THE CPE
        SPECIFICATION AND PRICES THE LINE AS ATT.  ON AN ANALOG CPE
        SPECIFICATION THE PROGRAM DOES NOT INCLUDE MODEM CHARGES, BUT
        DOES INCLUDE D1 CONDITIONING CHARGES.

        NOTE: THE RATES QUOTED ON ATT PROVIDED EQUIPMENT ARE FOR
              DATAPHONE-II MODEMS ON A 48 MONTH CONTRACT.                                                              Page  5   



              VI.  EXPLANATION OF STANDARD PROGRAM OUTPUT
              -------------------------------------------



        FOR EACH ENTRY IN THE INPUT FILE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS
        OUTPUT TO THE TERMINAL.


     .  LINE NUMBER - THIS NUMBER CORRESPONDS WITH THE POSITION OF THE
        ENTRY IN THE INPUT FILE.

     .  CITY NAME, STATE NAME, AND CLASS OF THE CITY ON EACH END OF THE
        LINE.

     .  MILES - THE LENGTH OF THE LINE IN MILES.

     .  TYPE - WHETHER THE LINE IS "DDS" OR "ANA"

     .  SPEED - THE BAND WIDTH OF THE LINE

     .  MIL.CHAR - THE MILEAGE CHARGE

     .  MOD/DSU - THIS IS THE MONTHLY MODEM CHARGE IF THE LINE IS AN
        ANALOG CIRCUIT.  THIS IS THE MONTHLY DSU CHARGE IF THE LINE IS A
        DDS CIRCUIT.  THE ANALOG MODEM CHARGE CONSISTS OF A MONTHLY
        CHARGE FOR EACH OF 2 AT&T MODEMS.  IF THE LINE HAS A BAND WIDTH
        OF 9600 THEN THIS CHARGE ALSO INCLUDES A D1 CONDITIONING CHARGE.
        IF A PARADYNE MODEM IS USED INSTEAD OF AT&T MODEMS THEN THE USER
        SHOULD APPLY THE CHARGE FOR PAYADYNE MODEMS AS SPECIFIED IN
        FILE: (PNETS)MODEM.DOC.


     .  TOT/MON - THE TOTAL MONTHLY COST (MIL.CHAR + MOD/DSU)

     .  INSTAL - THIS IS A ONE TIME INSTALLATION CHARGE.  IF PARADYNE
        MODEMS ARE USED THE USER SHOULD APPLY THE INSTALLATION FEE FOR
        PARADYNE MODEMS AS SPECIFIED IN FILE: (PNETS)MODEM.DOC.

     .  FLAGS.  ONE OF TWO FLAGS MAY APPEAR AT THE END OF THE LINE OF
        INFORMATION.

                "*" - THIS APPEARS AT THE END OF EACH LINE PRICED AS
                      DDS.  THE PROGRAM DOES NOT CHECK IF DDS IS
                      AVAILABLE BETWEEN THE TWO CITIES SPECIFIED.  SO
                      THE USER SHOULD CHECK IF DDS IS ACTUALLY AVAILABLE
                      ON LINES THE PROGRAM PRICES AS DDS.

                "C" - THIS APPEARS AT THE END OF EACH LINE WHERE THE
                      CHARGES REFLECT CUSTOMER PROVIDED EQUIPMENT.                                                              Page  6   



                "$" - THIS APPEARS AT THE END OF EACH LINE WHERE THE
                      MILEAGE IS ZERO, MEANING, THE LINE ORIGINATES AND
                      TERMINATES IN THE SAME CITY.  THE CHARGES LISTED
                      DO NOT USE THE CORRECT TARIFF RATES. INSTEAD THE
                      REGULAR LEASE LINE TARIFF IS USED WITH MILEAGE SET
                      TO ONE MILE TO OBTAIN AN APPOXIMATE COST.                                                              Page  7

THE NAME OF THE INPUT FILE WHICH IS LEASE.TST.  THE FOLLOWING IS A
SAMPLE OF HOW TO INTERPRET THE OUTPUT.

THE DISTANCE FROM CHICAGO TO DALLAS IS 799 MILES.  TO LEASE A 56KB DDS

                                     STATION TERMINATIONS. CHARGE CAN
                                     NOT BE BROKEN DOWN.
