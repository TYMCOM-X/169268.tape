                       SECTION 1 -- MAIN COMMANDS





The following are the commands recognized by TMS when it is in main
command mode.  The prompt for command in this mode is "*".  Most
commands and keywords can be abreviated.


1.1 quit

Format: quit

Logout from TMS.


1.2 probe

Format: probe [<supervisor_host>]

Enter PROBE for the specified supervisor. If no supervisor is given,
PROBE for the active supervisor is entered.  While in PROBE, the command
prompt is ":" and the commands recognized are all those listed in the
PROBE User's Guide except lrate, rnode, rlog and help.  The log command
format is the TMS log command format rather than the probe format.  To
exit PROBE, use the exit command "exi".


1.3 log

Format: log [<number> | <time>]

Start the logger. If no argument is given, start printing messages from
now. If a time is given, print messages starting from that time.  The
<time> is of the form month/day/year hour:minute:second.  The /year can
be omitted and the current year will be assumed. The seconds can also be
omitted with zero being used.  The <number> argument is any unsigned
integer and is the number of minutes in the past from where logger
messages should start printing. Examples,

        log
        log 60
        log 1/15/81 12:00:00
        log 1/15 12:00

Don't print logger, probe or display command information for the listed
nodes, hosts or events. The <number_list> is a sequence of unsigned
integers or ranges separated by spaces. A range is two unsigned
integers, the first less than or equal to the second, separated by a
dash. Node numbers are octal; host and events are decimal. Examples,

        ignore nodes 234
        ignore node 345-567 234 777 560-767
        ignore host 1089-1234 7-89

Format: list ignore {nodes | hosts | events}

List the nodes, hosts or events currently being ignored.


1.8 list profile

Format: set node <node> [<node_name>]

Give a name to a node. If the name is not given, clear the name.

        set node 2032


1.12 set host

Format: set host <host> [<host_name> [<node> [<position>]]]

exceptions will be displayed. Examples,

        display
        display hosts
