TYPE:  HARDWARE
HARDWARE:  CODEX 2160 CSU/
SUBJECT:  STRAPPING GUIDE FOR THE CODEX 2160 CSU/DSU FOR THE MOTOROLA PROJECT.


==============================================================================

This CFB explains how to option the Codex 2160 CSU/DSU (56 KB) for the
MOTOROLA Coverage Plus project.  This is a rack mounted unit and goes in
the Codex Modulus 18 Rack.  CFB 183 gives the information on how to set up
the Modulus 18 Rack.


                        Rear Panel Connections
                        ======================

On the back of the modem you will find two 25 pin RS232 connectors and one
8-pin modular jack.  The 25 pin connector labelled "DTE" accepts an adapter
cable that is 25-pin on one end and V.35 Winchester (female) on the other
end.  The TYMNET V.35 cable plugs into the female Winchester connector of the
adapter cable.  The modular 8-pin jack accepts the telco digital V.35
connection.  The other 25-pin RS232 connector is labelled "NETWORK" and is
for connection to a Network Management System (which is not used at the present
time).


                        Front Panel Description
                        =======================

The front panel consists of six LED's, a 16 digit LCD display, and four
control buttons.

The six LED's show: TXD, RXD, DCD, RTS, ST, AND NC.

The LCD display gives strapping, operational status, and test status.

The four buttons will be called out in this CFB as 1, 2, 3, & 4.
Button #1 has the three ascending squares.
Button #2 has the three squares in a row.
Button #3 has the "plus" sign inside the circle.
Button #4 has the three concentric circles.


                       Strapping Procedures
                       ====================


The default display appears on the LCD front panel whenever the 2160 passes
the UNIT SELF TEST.  It appears as "2160 TxRATE 56.0".  As you enter the
strapping mode the strapping parameters appear on the LCD display.

The front panel strapping menu displays allow you to choose test functions
and configure the unit for your particular application.  The menu structure
has four layers:  main menus, categories, parameters, and options.
Symbols are used to identify main menus and the relationship between parameters
and options.  Categories do not have symbols but are displayed in all uppercase
letters.

*  An asterisk identifies a main menu.  For example, *MODIFY is a main menu.

CAPS   All uppercase letters without a symbol identifies a category.  For
       example, MODIFY DSU is a category within the *MODIFY main menu.

=      The equal sign identifies a saved option for the selected parameter.
       For example, Timing=Network is a saved option for the specified para-
       meter of the MODIFY DSU category.

:      The colon identifies an available option for the selected parameter.
       For example, Timing:Internal is an available option for the specified
       parameter of the MODIFY DSU category.  The colon means it is available
       but has not been saved in non-volatile memory.

The following is a description of MAIN MENUS and their purpose:

  *TEST   Allows various test modes during troubleshooting and checkout.

  *STATUS  Allows examination of various modem operation parameters during
           actual operation.

  *MODIFY   Allows changing of internal strapping options.

  *AUXILIARY   Allows modification of various security and convenience features
               such as password protection and a 24-hour clock.




Now let's proceed to set the options:  (NOTE: Both ends will be optioned the
        same).

This completes the strap optioning of the unit.  If the unit is connected to
a digital line that is functional with a good working unit at the opposite
end then you should have the following control signals on the LED's of the
unit:  DCD, RTS, & ST should be green.  NC should be off.
If ST is red there is an alarm present and you should check the alarm status
menu indications on the LCD panel in the *STATUS general menu.
If the ST is flashing red or green the unit is in test mode.
If ST is solid green it means that power is on, there are no alarms, and the
unit is not in test mode.
The NC LED being off means that this unit is not attached to a Network Manage-
ment system.



                        Use of the *STATUS Capability
                        =============================

Under the *STATUS general menu heading are two very useful sub-headings
that can give information about the way the line is performing:
  Line Statistics and Alarm Status.

Line Statistics:  Press "1" three times when you are at the *STATUS menu and
                  you will be at the Line Statistics sub heading.  At this
                  point you can view Line Availability as a percentage of a
                  moving 30 day window (by pressing "2").  Press "2" again
                  and you can view the percentage of time during the 30 day
                  window that error free data was received.

Alarm Status:  Press "1" four times when you are at the *STATUS menu and you
               will be at the Alarm Status sub heading.  Press "2" and you can
               display the OS (Out of Service) parameter.  This indicates that
               the DSU/CSU is detecting out of service bipolar violations.
               This information is used to determine the percentage of line
               availability.  Press "2" again to view the LD (Link Down) para-
               meter.  This indicates that the DSU/CSU is no longer detecting
               a valid signal.  Press "2" again to view the RT (Remote Terminal)
               parameter.  This indicates an alarm condition that is logged
               whenever the telephone company initiates a digital loopback
               due to conditions on the digital line.  The same is true of the
               LL (Local Line Loopback) parameter.  Press "2" again to view the
               ASD (Auto Stream Detect).  This only applies to MP Slave
               configurations.  Tymnet does not use this configuration.
               Press "2" again to view the OF (Out of Frame) parameter.  This
               alarm appears when an invalid frame sequence is detected.
               Press "2" again and you can clear the alarm indications.



                       Use of the *TEST Capability
                       ===========================

Under the *TEST general menu heading are a series of LOOP tests and BER tests.
The following LOOP TESTS can be performed from the front panel:
    DSU CHECK, RT, LL, Rm Dig Lp (Mux Only), and Term Lpbk.
    Dsu Check: During the Dsu Check data from the attached DTE is passed
               through the transmit and receive circuitry of the DSU and looped
               back to the attached DTE (usually the Tymnet Engine).  Also,
               data coming in on the digital line is looped back to the far
               end of the digital line.
     RT:  During a Unilateral Remote Terminal Loopback, data from the remote
          DTE is passed through the receive and transmit circuitry of the local
          DSU and looped back to the remote DTE.  During a Bilateral Remote
          Terminal Loopback data from the local DTE is looped back to the local
          DTE.  At the same time, data from the remote DSU is passed through
          the receive and transmit circuitry of the local DSU and looped back
          to the remote DSU.
     LL:  During a Unilateral Local Line Loopback data from the remote DSU is
          received by the local DSU and looped back to the remote DSU without
          passing through the transmit and receive circuitry of the local DSU.
          During a Bilateral Local Line Loopback data from the attached DTE
          is passed through the transmit and receive circuitry of the local DSU
          and looped back to the attached DTE.  At the same time data from
          the remote DSU is received by the local DSU and looped back to the
          remote DSU without passing through the transmit and receive circuitry
          of the local DSU.

     Rm Dig Lp:  During Remote Digital Loopback data from the local DTE is
              passed through the transmit and receive circuitry of both the
              local and remote DSU.  The remote DSU loops the data back to
              the local DTE.

     Loc Dig Lp:  The local DSU loops incoming data through the transmit and
              receive circuitry of the local DSU and back to the remote DSU.

     Term Lpbk:  Terminal Loopback examines the interface between the DSU and
              and the DTE.  During this test the local DTE must be transmitting
              data.  Data from the local DTE is received by the local DSU and
              looped back to the attached DTE without passing through the
              transmit and receive circuitry of the DSU.  At the same time
              data from the digital line is looped back to the digital line
              toward the remote DSU.

Remember:
  1.  The 2160's at both ends of the line are optioned exactly the same.
  2.  Don't forget to attach the sheet metal piece to the rear panel of the
      2160 to prevent it from slipping out of its connection to the Modulus 18
      Rack.
