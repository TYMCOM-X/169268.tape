
     RECENTLY A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF DATA PRINTERS (CT-4964 AND CT-6644)
     HAVE BEEN INTERMITTENTLY GOING TO "STOP" MODE FROM THE "RUN" MODE.
     THIS HAS OCCURED WHILE PRINTING AND ALSO WHILE THE PRINTER IS IDLE
     BUT IN THE "RUN" MODE.

     THE TECH SUPPORT GROUP HAS GATHERED DATA FROM THE FIELD ON CAUSES AND
     SOLUTIONS.  BARRY TRAXLER, ECM REGIONAL TECH SUPPORT, HAS PROVIDED
     MUCH INFORMATION THROUGH HIS INVESTIGATION OF THE PROBLEM.

     FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF PROBABLE CAUSES AND SOLUTIONS:


     1.  PAPER LOW SYSTEM:  SOME PAPER LOW SWITCHES ARE NOISY SO THAT THEY 
         SEND GLITCHES AS THE PAPER CAUSES SLIGHT MOVEMENT OF THE SWITCH
         CONTACT ARM.  PAPER FEED BOARDS (P/N 12006) OF LOGIC LEVEL 5
         (LL 05) HAVE ECO 1909A WHICH FILTERS INCOMING GLITCHES FROM THE 
         PAPER LOW SWITCH.
         SOLUTION:  RUN A JUMPER WIRE FROM 3B9 TO 3B44 (DISABLES PAPER LOW
         SENSING) AND SEE IF THE PROBLEM CEASES OR DECREASES IN FRE-
         QUENCY (AS THERE COULD BE MORE THAN ONE CAUSE).  IF THE PROB-
         LEM CEASES OR OCCURS LESS FREQUENTLY IT INDICATES THAT THE PAPER
         LOW SYSTEM IS FAULTY.  CUP HANDS OVER THE PAPER LOW FAULT LED WHILE
         PRINTING AND SEE IF THE LED FLICKERS FAINTLY.  IF IT FLICKERS IT
         IS A FURTHER INDICATION THAT GLITCHES ARE BEING INTRODUCED INTO THE
         PAPER LOW SYSTEM.  CHECK THE PAPER FEED BOARD TO SEE IF "LL 05" IS
         STAMPED IN BLACK INK.  IF NOT, OBTAIN A PAPER FEED BOARD
         THAT IS LOGIC LEVEL 05 OR HIGHER.  ALSO, CHECK THE THROW OF THE
         PAPER LOW SWITCH WITH SINGLE PART PAPER TO MAKE SURE IT IS NOT CLOSE
         TO THE TRIP POINT.  IF IT IS TOO CLOSE TO THE TRIP POINT,  LOOSEN
         THE LOWER TWO SCREWS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE PAPER LOW SWITCH 
         HOUSING AND MOVE THE SWITCH HOUSING TO ACHIEVE THE PROPER ADJUSTMENT.
         IF THE PAPER LOW SWITCH IS ADJUSTED, TEST ITS OPERATION BEFORE RE-   
         TURNING THE PRINTER TO SERVICE.
                                                                         
     2.  STATIC ELIMINATOR SYSTEM:  INTERNAL ARCING IN THE TRANSFORMER,
         ARMORED CABLE, OR BAR CAN CAUSE THE PRINTER TO GO FROM "RUN"
         TO "STOP".
         SOLUTION:  FIRST, CLEAN THE STATIC ELIMINATOR BAR WITH A VACUUM
         CLEANER AND CLEAN EACH STATIC BAR ELECTRODE BY ROTATING A PENCIL
         ERASER OVER EACH ELECTRODE.  SEE IF THE PROBLEM CEASES OR OCCURS
         LESS FREQUENTLY.  IF THAT DOES NOT ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM,  DISCON-
         NECT THE 110 VOLTS A.C. TO THE HIGH VOLTAGE STATIC ELIMINATOR TRANS-
         FORMER AT THE POWER SUPPLY TERMINAL BLOCK.  IF THE PROBLEM CEASES  
         OR DECREASES IN FREQUENCY THERE IS A FAULT IN THE STATIC ELIMINATOR
         SYSTEM.                                                            

     3.  PAPER MOTION SENSING CIRCUIT:  GLITCHING ON THIS CIRCUIT CAN BE
         CAUSED BY A DIRTY, OILY, CHIPPED MOTION SENSOR (LIGHT-DARK) DECAL.
         ALSO, GLITCHING COULD BE CAUSED BY AN INTERMITTENT LED ASSEMBLY,
         AN INCORRECT DISTANCE FROM LED ASSEMBLY TO DECAL, OR MISADJUSTMENT
         OF LED SUPPLY POTENTIOMETER R51 ON THE H.S. ROM PRINT CONTROL BOARD
         (P/N 12036).
         SOLUTION:  JUMPER FROM "J" TO GROUND ON THE H.S. ROM PRINT CONTROL
         BOARD TO DISABLE THE MOTION SENSOR CIRCUIT.  THEN, SEE IF THE PROBLEM
         CEASES OR DECREASES IN FREQUENCY ( AS THERE COULD BE MORE THAN ONE
         CAUSE).  IF THE PROBLEM CEASES OR OCCURS LESS FREQUENTLY, IT INDI-
         CATES THAT THE PAPER MOTION SENSING SYSTEM IS FAULTY.  IT IS STRONGLY
         RECOMMENDED NOT TO LEAVE THE PAPER MOTION SENSING SYSTEM DISABLED TO
         ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM, BECAUSE IF THE PRINTER IS ALLOWED TO CONTINUE
         PRINTING WHILE PAPER IS JAMMED, SERIOUS DAMAGE COULD RESULT.        
         FIRST, INSPECT THE LIGHT-DARK DECAL FOR DIRT, OIL, OR CHIPPING.
         ENSURE THAT THE LED ASSEMBLY IS POSITIONED 1/2 INCH FROM THE DECAL
         AS PER FIGURE 3-42 OF THE DPC FORM 600-3 MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS
         BOOK.  ADJUST R51 ON THE H.S. ROM PRINT CONTROL BOARD WHILE SCOPING
         MOTHERBOARD PIN 5A-21 (GROUND SCOPE AT 5B-44).  ROTATE THE 
         SHAFT ON WHICH THE DECAL WHEEL IS LOCATED AND ENSURE THAT THE 
         SIGNAL VARIES FROM LESS THAN 2.0 VOLTS TO GREATER THAN 4.2 VOLTS
         (4.5 VOLTS IS RECOMMENDED).  ALSO, VISUALLY CHECK THE BRUSH THAT
         WIPES THE DECAL AND ENSURE THAT IT IS FREE FROM EXCESSIVE DIRT
         OR OIL THAT COULD CONTAMINATE THE DECAL.


     THE ABOVE THREE SYSTEMS HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR MOST OF THE CASES WHERE 
     PRINTERS GO FROM "RUN" TO "STOP" MODE.  BELOW ARE LISTED OTHER ITEMS
     WHICH MIGHT CAUSE THE PROBLEM.


     4.  LOOSE CONNECTION LUGS IN THE POWER SUPPLY:  IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT
         SOME POWER SUPPLIES HAVE CONNECTION LUGS THAT WERE NOT
         TIGHTENED DOWN.  THESE SHOULD BE INSPECTED AND TIGHTENED WHERE NEC-
         ESSARY.

     5.  SPIKING/GLITCHING ON INPUT A.C. POWER:  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT NOISY
         INPUT A.C. POWER COULD CAUSE THE PRINTER TO GO FROM "RUN" TO "STOP".
         IF NOISY INPUT POWER IS SUSPECTED, A DRANETZ POWER LINE MONITOR CAN
         BE BORROWED FROM THE TECH SUPPORT GROUP.

     6.  LINT AND DUST IN I.C. CHIP LEGS:  DUE TO THE PLACEMENT OF THE
         BLOWER FANS BELOW THE CARD CAGE, DUST AND LINT IS BLOWN UP INTO THE
         CIRCUIT CARDS.  THE RESULT IS THAT THE LOWER ROWS OF I.C. CHIPS
         HAVE DUST AND LINT JAMMED BETWEEN THE LEGS OF THE I.C.'S.  IT IS
         VERY LIKELY THAT HIGH RESISTANCE PATHS THEN DEVELOP WHICH CAUSE THE
         PRINTER TO MALFUNCTION.
         SOLUTION:  ENCOURAGE THE LOCAL USERS TO KEEP THE PRINTER ENVIRONMENT
         AS CLEAN AS POSSIBLE.  REMOVE EACH CIRCUIT BOARD EVERY THREE MONTHS,
         IF NECESSARY, AND CLEAN THE DUST.  THIS CAN BE DONE AS PART OF THE
         QUARTERLY P.M.  POWER DOWN PRINTER BEFORE REPLACING BOARDS.     

     7.  40 VOLT CROWBAR CIRCUIT:  IF THE HAMMER DRIVER OVERCURRENT
         ALARM ADJUSTMENT IS NOT SET CORRECTLY, THE PRINTER WILL INTERMIT-
         TENTLY POWER DOWN OR COULD POSSIBLY BE GOING FROM "RUN" TO
         "STOP".  
         SOLUTION:  PERFORM THE HAMMER DRIVER OVERCURRENT ALARM ADJUSTMENT
         AS PER PARAGRAPH 3.5.1.6 IN THE DPC FORM 600-3 MAINTENANCE INSTRUC-
         TIONS BOOK.

     8.  PAPERFEED SYSTEM ADJUSTMENTS, PHASE CLOCK ADJUSTMENT, CHARA-
         CTER STROBE AND INDEX AMPLITUDE:  VERIFY THAT THESE ADJUSTMENTS ARE
         WITHIN LIMITS SPECIFIED IN DPC FORM 600-3 MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS
         BOOK.

     9.  BAD SEQUENCER BOARD:  THERE HAS BEEN ONE REPORTED INSTANCE FROM THE
         FIELD THAT REPLACEMENT OF A SEQUENCER BOARD ELIMINATED A PROBLEM
         OF A PRINTER GOING FROM "RUN" TO "STOP".  

     10.  BROKEN PAPER CAGE GROUNDING WIRE:  VERIFY THAT A GROUNDING WIRE
          EXISTS BETWEEN THE PAPER CAGE AND THE FRAME OF THE PRINTER.
