 ISIS-II         SL.1          I. INTRODUCTION TO ISIS-II
                                  A. ISIS-INTERNALLY SWITCHED INTERFACE SYSTEM
                                     - IS NOT REALLY AND OPERATING SYSTEM,
                                     BUT A SET OF RULES AS TO HOW INTERFACES
                                     ARE TO BE CONSTRUCTED AND HOW THEY ARE
                                     TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER WITH A
                                     LITTLE CODE TO HANDLE INTERRUPTS.
                                  B. THE CONCEPT OF THE ISIS DESIGN IS TO
                                     ALLOW THE MACHINE TO BE DIVIDED INTO
                                     PARTITIONS, CALLED 'SLOTS'.
                                     THIS WOULD PROVIDE THE CAPACITY OF
                                     MAKING EACH OF THE VARIOUS NETWORK 
                                     INTERFACES A SEPARATE MODULE THAT COULS
                                     BE DEVELOPED, DEBUGGED AND DEPLOYED
                                     ON NETWORK NODES WHILE PROTECTING
                                     THESE NODES FROM POSSIBLE FAULTS
                                     IN THE INTERFACE.
                                  C. ISIS TREATS THE TYMNET NODE CODE AS
                                     JUST ANOTHER INTERFACE. THE TYMNET 
                                     NODE CODE HAS SPECIAL PROPERTIES ONLY
                                     WHEN EXECUTING IN SLOT 0.
                                     THESE INCLUDE THE ROUTING AND MONITORING
                                     FUNCTIONS RELATING TO THE TYMNET SUPE.
                                     * IF TYMNET INTERFACE IS EXECUTED IN
                                     OTHER SLOT, IT PERFORMS THE FUNCTION
                                     OF A GATEWAY TO TYMNET.
                               II. KERNAL PROCESS
                                     THE KERNEL, ALSO KNOWN AS SLOT FF 
                                     (IMPORTANT  TO KNOW FOR DEBUGGING)
                                     IS THE CONTROL CENTER OF THE ISIS
                                     OPERATING ENVIRONMENT.
                                     1. SCHEDULES CPU TIME FOR ALL PROCESSES.
                                     2. UPDATES SEG. F - WHICH IS 
                                        PHYSICALLY LOCATED IN THE KERNEL
                                        AREA OF MEMORY,,THAT IS SET UP    
                                        IN THE MAC SEGMENTATION REGISTERS.
                                        SEG. F IS A COMMON READ-ONLY DATA
                                        AREA FOR ALL SLOTS.
                                     3. PROCESSES SVC CALLS.
                                     4. HANDLES ALL HARDWARE INTERRUPTS 
                                        (THESE HAVE TOP PRIORITY WITHIN THE 
                                         MACHINE)
                                          A. KERNEL DOES NOT BUFFER ANY
                                             DATA,IT SIMPLY RUNS THE PROCESS
                                             AND TRANSFERS DATA TO THE SLOT.
                                          B. TRANSLATES PHYSICAL I/O 
                                             DEVICES INTO LOGICAL UNITS
                                             SEEN BY THE SLOTS.
                                III. DISPATCHER
                                     1. ACTS  AS A SWITCHING CENTER (COMM.
                                        CENTER) OF ISIS, ROUTING MESSAGES
                                        AND DATA FROM ORIGINATING SLOT 
                                        TO THE DESTINATION SLOT.
                                     2. DOES THE WORK OF SCHEDULING AND 
                                        PROCESSING DATA GOING BETWEEN SLOTS.
                                     3. DOES NOT HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE
                                        OF THE STRANGE PROPERTIES OF 
                                        SPECIFIC INTERFACES.
                                        - EACH SLOT (INTERFACE) MUST 
                                        FOLLOW A SET OF PROTOCOLS WHICH 
                                        IT USES TO TALK TO THE DISPATCHER.
                                        ( MIGHT NEED TO TRANSLATE REQUESTS
                                        AND MESSAGES TO THE STANDARD FORMAT)
                                     4. CHECKS THE DATA FLOW TO MAKE SURE
                                        THAT, IS THE INTERFACE IS IN ERROR,
                                        IT DAMAGES ONLY ITS DATA.
                                      5. RUNS EVERY TIME A TRUE BACKGROUND
                                        JOB RUNS, AND SETS UP BACKGROUND 
                                        JOB FOR ITS NEXT USE IN THE MACHINE.
                                     6. HAS ACCESS TO ALL MEMORY
                                     7. USES SEG.E OF EACH SLOT FOR DETERMINING
                                        THE SLOT'S CONFIGURATION.
                                        IT USES SEG. TO MAINTAIN RECORDS OF
                                        ONGOING EVENTS.
                                IV.  SLOTS & PROCESSES
                                     A. SLOT - A COLLECTION OF RESOURCES
                                        ALLOCATED TO A SINGLE ENTITY, 
                                        IT INCLUDES THE PARTICULAR
                                        PROCESS OR SET OF PROCESSES 
                                        CAPABLE OF USING THOSE RESOURCES.
                                     B. MEMORY
                                        1. EACH SLOT IS ALLOCATED ITS
                                        OWN MEMORY IN THE MACHINE.
                                        2. 3 -4 K IS ABOUT THE SMALLEST
                                        A SLOT RUNS IN.
                                        (WHATEVER THE KERNEL AND DISPATCHER
                                        DO NOT USE, IT IS AVAILABLE TO
                                        THE SLOTS.)
                                        3. MAX. NO. OF SLOTS IS 64 IN AN
                                        ISIS MACHINE.
                                        4. WHEN A SLOT IS RUNNING, IT HAS
                                        A SET OF 16 SEGMENTATION REGISTERS
                                        DEDICATED TO IT.
                                        5. SEG.14 (SEG. E) IS THE SLOT'S CTA,
                                        CONTAINING THE DESCRIPTORS NECESSARY
                                        TO DESCRIBE THE SLOT'S RUNNING 
                                        CONFIGURATION, SUCH AS POINTERS
                                        TO VARIABLES, MEMORY LAYOUT,ETC.
                                     C. PROCESSES
                                        ISIS DIVIDES JOBS INTO PROCESSES.
                                        THESE PROCESSES ARE, FOR THE PURPOSE
                                        OF SCHEDULING, INDEPENDENT JOBS.
                                        THEY ARE BROKEN DOWN INTO A HEIRARCHY
                                        OF LEVELS, OF WHICH THE SLOT IS

                                         1. FIRST SIGN OF A CIRCUIT IS THE 
                                         NEEDLE IN THE INPUT, MAY BE
                                         FOLLOWED BY MESSAGES FOR THAT PORT
                                         2. CIRCUITS ARE CONSTRUCTED BY
                                         THE SLOT 0 SUPE, AND THE PORTS 
                                         ARE ASSIGNED EXTERNAL TO THE 
                                         INTERFACE.
                                         SO, THE INTERFACE MUST SEND
                                         THE APPROPRIATE FORM OF 
                                         PSEUDO-NEEDLE REQUEST.
                                         3. SLOT 0 EITHER REJECTS IT, OR 
                                         RETURNS A PSEUDO-NEEDLE,CAUSING

              ISIS EXTERNAL COMMUNICATONS
              - FOR EACH LOGICAL INTERFACE, THERE MAY BE HARDWARE DRIVERS
                CONNECTED TO THEM
              - EXAMPLES OF THESE DRIVERS ARE:
                ASYNC.,SYNC.,SIO., OR SOME SORT OF SPECIAL I/O DEVICE
                DRIVER (PRINTER,DISC, ETC.)
              - ISIS SUPPORTS DRIVERS FOR ALL THESE DEVICES
              - EACH INTERFACE HAS TO REQUEST ACTUALD DATA TRANSFERS FROM
                THE DRIVERS, THROUGH THE KERNEL

                   1. ASYNCHRONOUS
                THIS IS ALSO KNOWN AS "START/STOP" COMM., AND IS USUALLY
                USED FOR RELATIVELY LOW-SPEED APPLICATIONS (LESS THAN 9600
                BAUD). EACH CHARACTER WITH A START BIT AND ONE OR TWO STOP
                BITS IF ASCII IS USED.

                CHARACTERS ARE SENT OUT ONE AT A TIME, AT ANY TIME. THE
                RECEIVING DEVICE LOOKS FOR A START BIT (0), BECAUSE THE LINE
                IS HELD HIGH DURING ITS IDLE PERIODS. WHEN IT DETECTS A 
                START BIT, IT STARTS SYNCHRONIZING ITSELF TO THE LINE SPEED,
                COUNTS THE INCOMING BITS OF DATA AND STORES THEM, AND THEN
                STRIPS OFF THE STOP BITS. THE STOP BITS SET THE LINE BACK
                TO ITS HIGH, IDLE STATE.

                EQUIPMENT FOR ASYNCHRONOUS COMMUNICATION IS CHEAP, SINCE NO
                COMMON CLOCK IS REQUIRED. IT IS MAINLY USED FOR TERMINAL-TO
                -TERMINAL OR TERMINAL-TO-COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS.


                   2. SYNCHRONOUS
                THIS TYPE OF COMMUNICATION USES A COMMON CLOCK SIGNAL, TO
                WHICH BOTH SENDING AND RECEIVING DEVICES ARE SYNCHRONIZED.
                THIS CLOCK IS ONE OF THE CONTROL LINES IN MOST HARDWARE
                INTERFACE SPECIFICATIONS. IT ALSO USES SPECIAL CHARACTERS
                TO MAINTAIN SUNCHRONIZATION BETWEEN THE TWO DEVICES WHEN
                THE LINE IS IDLE. THERE IS ANOTHER SPECIAL CHARACTER TO 
                SIGNAL THE END OF THE DATA. AFTER THE TRANSMISSION IS OVER,
                SYNCHRONIZATION CHARACTERS ARE SENT OUT AGAIN UNTIL THERE
                IS ANOTHER TRANSMISSION.

                FOR LONG MESSAGES, SYNCHRONOUS COMMUNICATION CONSIDERABLY
                REDUCES THE NUMBER OF BITS THAT ARE SENT, SINCE THERE ARE ONLY
                TWO SPECIAL CHARACTERS FOR EACH MESSAGE, RATHER THAN START
                AND STOP BITS FOR EACH CHARACTER. IT REQUIRES MORE COMPLEX
                AND EXPENSIVE MODEMS AND IS USUALLY USED FOR COMPUTER-TO-
                COMPUTER LINKS, AS IN TYMNET NETWORK.


                   3. SIO (SERIALLY INPUT OUTPUT)
                THIS IS A BOARD THAT PROVIDES CONTROL OF HIGH SPEED SYNC.
                AND ASYNC. LINES.  THE SIO CONTROLLER BOARD CAN CONTROL
                UP TO 16 ASYNC. LINES AT THE MAX. SPEED OF 480,000 BPS.
                IN SYNC. MODE, THE CONTROLLER BOARD SUPPORTS EITHER THE 
                BIT STUFFING(SDLC/HDLC) PROTOCOLOR BYTE SYNC.(E.G. BSC)
                PROTOCOL.
                EACH MOTHER BOARD CAN CONNECT TO UP TO 8 DAUGHTER BOARDS.
                THERE ARE CURRENTLY 4 TYPES OF DAUGHTER BOARDS APPLICABLE
                TO THE SIO BOARDS.
                3.1 V.24 ASYNC.
                   - HANDLES 2 LINES USING THE V.24/RS232 STANDARD INTERFACE
                   AT SPEED UP TO 9600 BAUD.
                3.2 OPTICALLY COUPLED
                   - FOR HARDWIRED CONNECTIONS BETWEEN MACHINES WITHIN A
                   FEW HUNDRED FEET OF EACH OTHER AT SPEEDS UP TO 
                   162,500 BPS.
                3.3 V.24 SYNC.
                   - HANDLES 2 LINES USING THE V.24/RS232 STANDARD INTERFACE
                   AT SPEEDS UP TO 20,000 BPS.
                3.4 V.35 SYNC.
                   - HANDLES 2 LINES USING THE V.35 STANDARD INTERFACE AT
                   SPEEDS UP TO 160,000 BPS.

                   NOTE:
                   ----
                   PER MOTHER BOARD:

              INTERNAL PROCESS COMMUNICATIONS
              1. COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN SLOTS ARE DONE THRU THE DISPATCHER
              BY MEANS OF IRING AND ORING
              2. THERE IS NO CONSTRAINT ON THE SIZE OF THE BUFFERS.
              THE DISPATCHER TRIES TO MOVE DATA FROM THE SOURCE PROCESS
              TO THE DESTINATION, BUT SOMETIMES IS UNABLE TO. AS A CONSE-
              QUENCE, THE DISPATCHER WOULD TRY TO BACKPRESSURE THE 
              SOURCE PORT INSTEAD.
              3. WHEN A SLOT REQUESTS A CIRCUIT TO ANOTHER HOST, THE 
              DISPATCHER GETS INFO. FROM SLOT 0 AS TO WHETHER THE CIRCUIT IS
              AN INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL CONNECTION. IF IT IS INTERNAL, THE 
              DISPATCHER WILL SET UP THE COMM. PATH.
              4. THE INTERNAL FORMAT OF DATA BEING TRANSMITTED MUST BE 
              UNIFORM. EACH MESSAGE HAS A HEADER CONTAINING PORT NUMBET AND
              MESSAGE TYPE.(THE MESSAGE TYPE HELPS DETERMINE SIZE OF MESSAGE
              SO AS TO AVOID PROCESSING EACH BYTE)
              5. CIRCUITS MAY BE

              INTERNAL PROCESS COMMUNICATIONS
              1. COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN SLOTS ARE DONE THRU THE DISPATCHER
              BY MEANS OF IRING AND ORING
              2. THERE IS NO CONSTRAINT ON THE SIZE OF THE BUFFERS.
              THE DISPATCHER TRIES TO MOVE DATA FROM THE SOURCE PROCESS
              TO THE DESTINATION, BUT SOMETIMES IS UNABLE TO. AS A CONSE-
              QUENCE, THE DISPATCHER WOULD TRY TO BACKPRESSURE THE 
              SOURCE PORT INSTEAD.
              3. WHEN A SLOT REQUESTS A CIRCUIT TO ANOTHER HOST, THE 
              DISPATCHER GETS INFO. FROM SLOT 0 AS TO WHETHER THE CIRCUIT IS
              AN INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL CONNECTION. IF IT IS INTERNAL, THE 
              DISPATCHER WILL SET UP THE COMM. PATH.
              4. THE INTERNAL FORMAT OF DATA BEING TRANSMITTED MUST BE 
              UNIFORM. EACH MESSAGE HAS A HEADER CONTAINING PORT NUMBET AND
              MESSAGE TYPE.(THE MESSAGE TYPE HELPS DETERMINE SIZE OF MESSAGE

 ISIS-II         SL.1          I. INTRODUCTION TO ISIS-II
                                  A. ISIS-INTERNALLY SWITCHED INTERFACE SYSTEM
                                     - IS NOT REALLY AND OPERATING SYSTEM,
                                     BUT A SET OF RULES AS TO HOW INTERFACES
                                     ARE TO BE CONSTRUCTED AND HOW THEY ARE
                                     TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER WITH A
                                     LITTLE CODE TO HANDLE INTERRUPTS.
                                  B. THE CONCEPT OF THE ISIS DESIGN IS TO
                                     ALLOW THE MACHINE TO BE DIVIDED INTO
                                     PARTITIONS, CALLED 'SLOTS'.
                                     THIS WOULD PROVIDE THE CAPACITY OF
                                     MAKING EACH OF THE VARIOUS NETWORK 
                                     INTERFACES A SEPARATE MODULE THAT COULS
                                     BE DEVELOPED, DEBUGGED AND DEPLOYED
                                     ON NETWORK NODES WHILE PROTECTING
                                     THESE NODES FROM POSSIBLE FAULTS
                                     IN THE INTERFACE.
                                  C. ISIS TREATS THE TYMNET NODE CODE AS
                                     JUST ANOTHER INTERFACE. THE TYMNET 
                                     NODE CODE HAS SPECIAL PROPERTIES ONLY
                                     WHEN EXECUTING IN SLOT 0.
                                     THESE INCLUDE THE ROUTING AND MONITORING
                                     FUNCTIONS RELATING TO THE TYMNET SUPE.
                                     * IF TYMNET INTERFACE IS EXECUTED IN
                                     OTHER SLOT, IT PERFORMS THE FUNCTION
                                     OF A GATEWAY TO TYMNET.
                               II. KERNAL PROCESS
                                     THE KERNEL, ALSO KNOWN AS SLOT FF 
                                     (IMPORTANT  TO KNOW FOR DEBUGGING)
                                     IS THE CONTROL CENTER OF THE ISIS
                                     OPERATING ENVIRONMENT.
                                     1. SCHEDULES CPU TIME FOR ALL PROCESSES.
                                     2. UPDATES SEG. F - WHICH IS 
                                        PHYSICALLY LOCATED IN THE KERNEL
                                        AREA OF MEMORY,,THAT IS SET UP    
                                        IN THE MAC SEGMENTATION REGISTERS.
                                        SEG. F IS A COMMON READ-ONLY DATA
                                        AREA FOR ALL SLOTS.
                                     3. PROCESSES SVC CALLS.
                                     4. HANDLES ALL HARDWARE INTERRUPTS 
                                        (THESE HAVE TOP PRIORITY WITHIN THE 
                                         MACHINE)
                                          A. KERNEL DOES NOT BUFFER ANY
                                             DATA,IT SIMPLY RUNS THE PROCESS
                                             AND TRANSFERS DATA TO THE SLOT.
                                          B. TRANSLATES PHYSICAL I/O 
                                             DEVICES INTO LOGICAL UNITS
                                             SEEN BY THE SLOTS.
                                III. DISPATCHER
                                     1. ACTS  AS A SWITCHING CENTER (COMM.
                                        CENTER) OF ISIS, ROUTING MESSAGES
                                        AND DATA FROM ORIGINATING SLOT 
                                        TO THE DESTINATION SLOT.
                                     2. DOES THE WORK OF SCHEDULING AND 
                                        PROCESSING DATA GOING BETWEEN SLOTS.
                                     3. DOES NOT HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE
                                        OF THE STRANGE PROPERTIES OF 
                                        SPECIFIC INTERFACES.
                                        - EACH SLOT (INTERFACE) MUST 
                                        FOLLOW A SET OF PROTOCOLS WHICH 
                                        IT USES TO TALK TO THE DISPATCHER.
                                        ( MIGHT NEED TO TRANSLATE REQUESTS
                                        AND MESSAGES TO THE STANDARD FORMAT)
                                     4. CHECKS THE DATA FLOW TO MAKE SURE
                                        THAT, IS THE INTERFACE IS IN ERROR,
                                        IT DAMAGES ONLY ITS DATA.
                                      5. RUNS EVERY TIME A TRUE BACKGROUND
                                        JOB RUNS, AND SETS UP BACKGROUND 
                                        JOB FOR ITS NEXT USE IN THE MACHINE.
                                     6. HAS ACCESS TO ALL MEMORY
                                     7. USES SEG.E OF EACH SLOT FOR DETERMINING
                                        THE SLOT'S CONFIGURATION.
                                        IT USES SEG. TO MAINTAIN RECORDS OF
                                        ONGOING EVENTS.
                                IV.  SLOTS & PROCESSES
                                     A. SLOT - A COLLECTION OF RESOURCES

              ISIS EXTERNAL COMMUNICATONS
              - FOR EACH LOGICAL INTERFACE, THERE MAY BE HARDWARE DRIVERS
                CONNECTED TO THEM
              - EXAMPLES OF THESE DRIVERS ARE:
                ASYNC.,SYNC.,SIO., OR SOME SORT OF SPECIAL I/O DEVICE
                DRIVER (PRINTER,DISC, ETC.)
              - ISIS SUPPORTS DRIVERS FOR ALL THESE DEVICES
              - EACH INTERFACE HAS TO REQUEST ACTUALD DATA TRANSFERS FROM
                THE DRIVERS, THROUGH THE KERNEL

                   1. ASYNCHRONOUS
                THIS IS ALSO KNOWN AS "START/STOP" COMM., AND IS USUALLY
                USED FOR RELATIVELY LOW-SPEED APPLICATIONS (LESS THAN 9600
                BAUD). EACH CHARACTER WITH A START BIT AND ONE OR TWO STOP
                BITS IF ASCII IS USED.

                CHARACTERS ARE SENT OUT ONE AT A TIME, AT ANY TIME. THE
                RECEIVING DEVICE LOOKS FOR A START BIT (0), BECAUSE THE LINE
                IS HELD HIGH DURING ITS IDLE PERIODS. WHEN IT DETECTS A 
                START BIT, IT STARTS SYNCHRONIZING ITSELF TO THE LINE SPEED,
                COUNTS THE INCOMING BITS OF DATA AND STORES THEM, AND THEN
                STRIPS OFF THE STOP BITS. THE STOP BITS SET THE LINE BACK
                TO ITS HIGH, IDLE STATE.

                EQUIPMENT FOR ASYNCHRONOUS COMMUNICATION IS CHEAP, SINCE NO
                COMMON CLOCK IS REQUIRED. IT IS MAINLY USED FOR TERMINAL-TO
                -TERMINAL OR TERMINAL-TO-COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS.


                   2. SYNCHRONOUS
                THIS TYPE OF COMMUNICATION USES A COMMON CLOCK SIGNAL, TO
                WHICH BOTH SENDING AND RECEIVING DEVICES ARE SYNCHRONIZED.
                THIS CLOCK IS ONE OF THE CONTROL LINES IN MOST HARDWARE
                INTERFACE SPECIFICATIONS. IT ALSO USES SPECIAL CHARACTERS
                TO MAINTAIN SUNCHRONIZATION BETWEEN THE TWO DEVICES WHEN
                THE LINE IS IDLE. THERE IS ANOTHER SPECIAL CHARACTER TO 
                SIGNAL THE END OF THE DATA. AFTER THE TRANSMISSION IS OVER,
                SYNCHRONIZATION CHARACTERS ARE SENT OUT AGAIN UNTIL THERE
                IS ANOTHER TRANSMISSION.

                FOR LONG MESSAGES, SYNCHRONOUS COMMUNICATION CONSIDERABLY
                REDUCES THE NUMBER OF BITS THAT ARE SENT, SINCE THERE ARE ONLY
                TWO SPECIAL CHARACTERS FOR EACH MESSAGE, RATHER THAN START
                AND STOP BITS FOR EACH CHARACTER. IT REQUIRES MORE COMPLEX
                AND EXPENSIVE MODEMS AND IS USUALLY USED FOR COMPUTER-TO-
                COMPUTER LINKS, AS IN TYMNET NETWORK.


                   3. SIO (SERIALLY INPUT OUTPUT)
                THIS IS A BOARD THAT PROVIDES CONTROL OF HIGH SPEED SYNC.
                AND ASYNC. LINES.  THE SIO CONTROLLER BOARD CAN CONTROL
                UP TO 16 ASYNC. LINES AT THE MAX. SPEED OF 480,000 BPS.
                IN SYNC. MODE, THE CONTROLLER BOARD SUPPORTS EITHER THE 
                BIT STUFFING(SDLC/HDLC) PROTOCOLOR BYTE SYNC.(E.G. BSC)
                PROTOCOL.
                EACH MOTHER BOARD CAN CONNECT TO UP TO 8 DAUGHTER BOARDS.
                THERE ARE CURRENTLY 4 TYPES OF DAUGHTER BOARDS APPLICABLE
                TO THE SIO BOARDS.
                3.1 V.24 ASYNC.
                   - HANDLES 2 LINES USING THE V.24/RS232 STANDARD INTERFACE
                   AT SPEED UP TO 9600 BAUD.
                3.2 OPTICALLY COUPLED
                   - FOR HARDWIRED CONNECTIONS BETWEEN MACHINES WITHIN A
                   FEW HUNDRED FEET OF EACH OTHER AT SPEEDS UP TO

               NAD
                -- Node Assembler and Debugger
                   ---> Is a progran used to assemble TYMFILES and
                   general software into Object files or Node 
                   Image Binary (NIB) files. The process prepares
                   the software for loading into the engine via
                   the LOADII program.
                   NAD is also used to load software directly for 
                   slots in nodes that are already in the network.
                   ---> The NAD program executes command files to
                   assemble the various pieces of software.
                   When assembling files:-
                        1) Put all the files together in a Command file
                           (CMD file)
                        2) Assemble each file individually

                   1. To invoke NAD
                      -R NAD
                      ----> It returns the current version number.
                            NAD gives no user prompts.
                      -%Q or esc-esc
                      ----> Is used to exit NAD
                   2. To assemble text
                      ;@ or ;A
                      ----> Is used to assemble a file
                      %@ or %A
                      ----> Is used to assemble a file with listing.
                            The listing will be in  File.lst
                      2.1 Input to the assembler comes from a file which
                          consists of engine instruction mnemonics or
                          NAD assembler directives.
                      2.2 Delimeters used to separate statements are :
                             A> carriage return (C/R)
                             B> semicolon (;)
		
		  3. Statements
		     -- a string of symbols,fields, and expressions that
		        end with a <CR> or ;
		        
		  4. Numbers
		       4.1 default is hex.
		       4.2 the first digit must be between 0 and 9
		           A000 ----> Nad will see this as a symbol
                           0A000----> a number
                       4.3 value of number depends on the radix
                             0  ---  normal hex radix
                             2  ---  binary
                             8  ---  octal
                             A  ---  decimal
                           ex. $A 130 ---->  decimal 130
                           
                   5. Symbols (labels)
                       5.1 a string of 1 to 6 alphanumeric and may
                           include embedded periods.
                           ex. timedown and timedown1 are the same.
                       5.2 first character must be a letter
                       5.3 "." symbol is an exception.
                           it means the current program counter.
                    
                   6. Computed symbols
                       6.1 The expression between two '|' embedded
                           in a symbol is evaluated, according to
                           the current radix.
                       6.2 The value of this expression replaces the
                           original expression.
                           ex.
                                Q    EQ   0
                                     RE   9
                            SYM|Q|   HS   1
                                Q    EQ   Q+1
                                     ER
                            These create the following halfword symbols
                                   SYM0
                                   SYM1
                                    |
                                    |
                                    |
                                   SYM8
                                   
                       7. Operators
                           7.1 no blanks between the operator and the value
                               they operate on.
                           7.2 the higher precedence (priority) operations
                               are performed before the lower precedence
                               operations.
                               'R'  stand for an expression
                               +R   (7) ---> value of R
                               -R   (7) ---> negative value of R
                               @R   (7) ---> one's complement of R
                               \R   (7) ---> used to determine if the label
                                             R has been defined
                                             - the value is 1 if defined
                                             - the value is 0 if not
                               L^R  (6) ---> shift R times left on positive
                                             & R times right on neg.
                               L*R  (5) ---> L times R
                               L+R  (4) ---> L plus R
                               L-R  (4) ---> L minus R

               ----------
               
               ----> The Opcode field may contain assembler directives
               1.  Symbol Control
                   1.1  Label      EQ       <Expression>
                        -->  The expression is evaluated & placed in
                        symbol table at that address.
                        (ie. equates the address of the label to expression)

                        another module may reference them.
                        Both modules must declare the symbol in their
                        global lists to be able to reference it.
                   
                   1.3             UN

                        from the symbol table.
                        *** If you are going to define a MACRO,
                            kill it first before redefine it.

                       first char. at the current PC is stored.
                       ex.

                       is inserted before the string.
                       ex.
                       Msg1       SC     /Host is up now "8d"8a/
                       What it does in memory:
                          (1) it puts in a byte of 00,
                              followed by the message, in hex.
                          (2) when incountering the '/', it
                              rewrites the 00 with the total no. of
                              character counts in the message.

               4.   Program Counter
                   ---->  The '.' (period) symbol is used as the lacation 
                   counter. (byte value in hex.)
                   4.1  Label    ORG   <Exp>
                        -- changes the program counter to an explicit
                        address,<Exp>
                        (only during assembly time)
                        In another word, ORG tells assembler where
                        to put something in core during assembly.
                        (set PC at an explicit address)
                        ex.
                        Start       ORG    10000
                                           |
                                           |
                                           ---> high order bit specifies
                                                segment in MAC

                    4.2  Label    BND    <Exp>
                        -- changes word boundary
                           forces the PC(.) to the next <exp>,word boundary
                                  BND    0-1  :  force to byte boundary
                                  BND    2    :  force to halfword
                                  BND    4    :  force to fullword 
                                  BND    8    :  force to double-word
                                  BND    10   :  force to quadword
                                  BND    100  :  forceto page
                                  BND    1000 :  force to segment
                                  
                         What happens is :-
                           NAD takes the value in BND, adds it to where 
                          you are, then ANDS off the two low order bits.
                          ( increments PC to the next boundary specified)

  p.87              4.3  Label    SEG    <exp>
 ISIS-II                 -- changes segments,allowing defferent parts           
                            to have their own segment (0-15d)
                            Note :
                            This is to set the PC to segment <exp>

                                 A.BUFF  =  2
                            Seg. tells which segment you are assembling on.

               5.  Modules
                   -- These directives allow the program to be broken 
                   into modules. And permits user to define a set of
                   symbols that only exist in that module.
                   (although the same symbols might be used in other
                   modules , as well)
                    5.1          MO     orgexp,Ascnam

                        the name Ascnam.
                        Orgexp is usually defined as the current PC., 
                        this is to prevent you not to accidentally
                        write over other codes.   (Default is .MAIN )
                        There are 32 out of 36 modules available to user.

                        undefined symbols for the module ending.
                        ( at this time, assembler would go back to the
                        MAIN until another MO directive is encountered)
                        
                    5.3          LO     Ascnam                        
                        -- used when the user wants to reference symbols
                        in another module, the LO command makes them 
                        local to him.

                    5.4          FO     Ascnam
                        -- makes a list of symbols in module Ascnam
                        foreign to that module.
                        
                        Note :- LO & FO are generally used for
                                debugging purposes.
                                
                        Example :-
                        
                            MO    Sync   :  starting of the module Sync
                            GL    ....   :  if you need labels within module

                        As a result, on the terminal would print :-

_______________________________________________________________________________

               Definition of a MACRO:-
                  The idea of a MACRO arises from the fact that there are
                 certain instruction sequences which are repeated
                 often.  The basic patterns of these sequences can be 
                 defined as MACROs, & the minor variations can be
                 accomplished by use of parameters to the
                 MACROs and by the conditional assembly feature.
                  In NAD, we have both the pre-defined MACROs,
                 as well as the user-defined MACROs.
                 
                 1. MACRO definition
                 
                 <name>   MACRO(<arg1>,<arg2>,...<argn>)[<text>]
                 
                 <name>  --->  name of this MACRO,
                               it follows the rule for NAD symbols.
                 <arg1>,<arg2>.....
                         --->  optional,
                               - must be surrounded by parentheses
                               - can have up to 16 arguments
                               - must be separated by commas.
                 <text>  --->   MACRO body              
                                has to start with a [ and end with a ]

                 2. Calling a MACRO
                    A MACRO call takes place when the following
                    statement appears.

                        <name>   (<arg1>,<arg2>,     <argn>)	
                        where :
                        <name>  -->  name of the already defined MACRO.
                        arguments --> symbols or constants from the 
                                      calling program.

                    example :-
                        LKNUM     EQ     0
                        TIILNK    MACRO(Neig,Ngrp,Ws,Typ,Speed)[

                 Nneig|Lknum|     EQ     $8  Neig
                 Nngro|Lknum|     EQ     $A  Ngrp  		
                   Nws|Lknum|     EQ     $A  Ws
                          IF      \Typ
                   Ntp|Lknum|     EQ     $A  Typ
                          EI
                          IF      \Speed
                   Nsp|Lknum|     AC     /Speed/
                   Lknum          EQ     Lknum+1
                                  KILL   Neig,Ngrp,Ws,Typ,Speed
                                     ]
               Note :  Labels used within MACRO should not be the same as in 
                     MACRO definition, else you will have a conflict.

    Lab One :
        
        The purpose of this lab exercise is to familiarize the student
    with the process of communicating with the ISIS Dispatcher rings.
    It will also acquaint the student with the use of NAD, ISIS libraries
    and establishing the memory conventions required in a slot.
    
    Write code for a slot that will bring a host up & answered.
    Allow one, and only one, circuit to be built to the host.
    Once the login is received, output a welcome message to the port
    that identifies your slot & host.
    After that, look at the data coming in for a 'P' or 'Q'.
    If it is a 'P', output the value of the slow clock (SLOWC).
    If it is a 'Q', send a logoff message to the port , then ZAP
    the circuit and look for a new login to repeat the process.

    The student may ignore backpressure, all data messages with
    a length greater than one, & the Ball logic or terminal
    characteristics.
    Remember not to 'hog' the CPU, DISMISS if possible.

                1.1  Required parameters to be defined
                -   Most library packages require certain parameters to be
                pre-defined.
                -   Standard ones to all interfaces :

                :  MMxxxx.T0n         name of this file, with n=slot number
                Maxhst     EQ     1    :  max. no. of hosts for this slot
                Maxprt     EQ    $A 32 :  max. no. of ports for this slot
                Ntout      EQ     5    :  no. of timeout list entries
                                       :  not required if not using 
                                       :  Timeout package

                Orsize     EQ    200   :  size of ISIS output ring, in bytes
                Cntrl      EQ    1     :  first word of CTA area,
                                       :  controlling Dispatcher bits
                Maxchar    EQ    14    :  no. of chars. to input before break
                Echo       EQ     1    :  set up for Tymsat echo
                Engine     EQ    1     :  set to 1 if Tymnet engine
                
                THIS IS A SLOT TYMFILE.

                1.2    Start.Lib
                
                ---->  This is an essential file that MUST be assembled
                right after the slot Tymfile.
                ---->  1)  define 15d  locations
                           ex.  Fastc,Slowc,GMT,etc.
                       2)  define registers
                           ex.   R0  EQ  0
                                 R1  EQ  1
                                     |
                                     |
                                 R15 EQ  15
                       3)  define segments default if not defined by the
                           programmer.
                       4)  define SVC's
                       5)  define global symbols to be referenced by
                           all modules.

                1.3  Finish.Lib
                ---->  This file should always be assembled last.
                    (1) checks if any segments overflow
                    (2) sets up CTA tables
                    (3) tells memory requirements
                        and fives final sizes
                    (4) lists out all undefined symbols.

                1.4  Fring.Lib
                ---->  This file is the ISIS ring handlers.
                This package has the following constraints
                    R15 __  Output Ring Index
                    R14 __  Input Ring Index
                Remember that :-
                    1. once started, reg. 14 or 15 is dedicated
                to that operation. until it is 'ended'
                    2. if a new operation is started before the
                previous operation is 'ended', the previous 
                operation is aborted, and the appropriate
                ring is effectively left unchanged.

                     A. Utility Routines
                         -  link   R5
                         -  preserve R6-R14
                OCS    Output Canned String
                       R2  =  port #
                       R3  =  poiter to string (SC format)
                       OCS will output string as a data message to the 
                       specified port.
                       No interrupt for this operation.
                OCM    Output Canned Message
                       R2  =  port #
                       R3  =  pointer to string (SC format)
                       OCM will output the string as a message to the

                ISIS  DDT :
                ---------

                1. DDT is a  separate background job under ISIS, operating
                   in a slot. It is under the control of the kernel and
                   permits a user to log in to the Kernel and load or
                   examine the contents of a slot.
                   It also permits the user to change the contents of 
                   memory locations within the slot and perform various
                   special diagnostic operations.

                2. To log in :-
                   2.1  Thru the network, by directing the log-in to
                   that machine's host 0. (host no. of the kernel)
                   2.2  Using NAD
                   2.3  On site, using Tty.

                3. Licenses are needed to allow people to access DDT.

                4. Processes in using DDT :
                   4.1 The kernel has what is called a Good-Guy list,
                   used to verify the status of the username logging in.
                   If the user is valid, login may proceed, otherwise dropped.
                   4.2 when valid, slot assignment is checked;
                   if none, the kernel will ask for a slot no.
                   4.3 if the slot is available, the user is connected to DDT.

                5. Good-Guy List
                   - goes at the bottom of the Tymfile.
                     (defined by the Macro XGG)
                   - this is a list of usernames with their access licenses,
                     which permit access to certain special slots.
                   - every valid user has access to the normal "application"
                     slots (slot no. > 0)

                     Example of some access licenses:-
                       L.S0A --> license to log in to slot 0
                       L.SYA --> license to lot in to slot FF (the ISIS kernel)
                       L.SUA --> license to log in to slots associated with
                                 the Supe.(only matters when there is a Supe
                                 on this machine.)
                       L.S0P --> slot 0 patch access
                       L.SYR --> system read access (reading out of kernel)
                       L.SYP --> system (kernel) patch access
                       L.S0R --> slot 0 read only
                       L.P   --> normal patch access(permits patching a 
                                 running slot)
                       L.L   --> load slot
                       L.R   --> slot read
                       L.H   --> halt slot
                       L.DISC -> license to format a disc. for a slot

                        !  ---->  'OR' operation
                       -1  ---->  means 'all' slots accessibility

                NAD Debugger

                1. commands are used to the NAD system thru the Debugger.
                   For ex.,   ;x  is a Debugger command.
                2. the Debugger allows you to assemble different modules
                   into a single assembly & to examine the contents of
                   the assembly, as well as change values in the assembly.
                3. works with the file just assembled.
                4. allows to look at the core memory.
                5. allows to access DDT.


                <CR>   sets the current type-out mode to the standard
                       type-out mode , and sets the current radix to the
                       standard radix.

                Current Type-out mode                       
                       - is the form in which memory contents or addresses               
                       are displayed; it can be one of the following:-
                           (1)  magnitude
                           (2)  (signed) numeric
                           (3)  Ascii
                           (4)  Symbolic
                           (5)  Instruction
                       Different Type-out modes assist in understanding
                       the contents of a memory location or an address,
                       for example:
                            -  magnitude,numeric, or Ascii may be desired
                               whenlooking at a data location.
                            -  instruction mode would be desired when
                               looking at 'locations containing code'.


                 Command       Description
                 -------       -----------

                 <LF>          - causes consecutive reading of the memory.
                               - advances PC to PC + 2 (or 4, depending on
                               whether in halfword or fullword mode),
                               and displays memory from new PC, according
                               to the current Type-out mode.
                               This will change old memory if a value has been 
                               entered.

                 ;^            same as <LF>, except that it decrements PC.

                  1.2  Contents of Tymfile and other files
                       1.2.1  Tymfile
                          A)  Tymfiles are the files that contain the                   
                              description of the network configuration and
                              its interfaces. Each file contains statements
                              which are set according to the chosen config.
                              When a Tymfile has been completed, it will be 
                              assembled with the source and initialization 
                              files to provide the network software. Each 
                              node must have its own Tymfiles configured to
                              indicate its unique capabilities and interfaces.
                              *  Tymfiles for programs running in ISIS slots
                              will define the choices made for each of the
                              available options in these programs.
                          B)  it is recommended that a master copy of each 
                              basic type of Tymfile be maintained, as every
                              node in the network may be so unique that the 
                              user may forget all the available options or 
                              find it difficult to reconstruct a set of
                              preferred choices.
                          C)  Most of the ISIS initialization files are under
                              the SOURCE directory.
                           D) what has always been done with Tymfiles, is                                                          
                              that , we would read in an existing Tymfile 
                              applicable to our needs, & make changes as 
                              neccessary, before writing it into our own
                              named Tymfile.
                              (following the naming conventions)
                           E) Tymfile is basically a file that will be
                              processed by the NAD assembler and is
                              used to define a set of variables. These 
                              definitions are either in the form of
                              EQUATE statements or a MACRO call.
                              All programs (node code,slot code,ISIS kernel)
                              require Tymfiles to establish which options
                              are desired and what physical (or logical)
                              resources are available.
                              In this way, the user describes the physical 
                              config. of the Engine on which the code is
                              to run.

                         1.2.2 Command file (.CMD file)
                           A) designed to execute a series of NAD commands
                              to create a NIB file.
                           B) certain files must be specified in every 
                              command file for any product or job ;-
                              1.  initialization file(s)
                              2.   a Tymfile

                           C) command files for assembling specific slots 
                               on a node have
                                  Css  instead of CMD file
                                  Tss  instead of Tym specified,
                                  and Nss instead of NIB specified,
                                  where ss =  slot number
                                  
                           D) explanation of CMD file
                              -  This is the command file for the Kernel

                                  of the Tymfile.
                              5.  actual Kernel source code
                              6.  a small source code telling ISIS that it 
                                  runs in T2 environments.

                      - Slot 0 is always designated for node code
                      - A slot Tymfile depends on the function of the slot,
                      for ex., slot used for Tymsat would have different 
                      parameters than slot used for Gateway or Tymcom.
                      *In a node that contains the Supe, the slots are used for:-
                      RAM, VAL,and may be with other functions needed for that
                      particular Supe.(Supe might also be a gateway)

                1. Timout.Lib
                - This is a package containing the standard timeout routines.
                - Some parameters MUST be defined on entry:
                  1.1 NTOUT
                  ---> no. of timeout entries which may be active at any 
                  one time.

                  1.5 TOPUT
                  ---> any code may call this to place an entry on
                  timeout list
                  ---> link on R5, with R6-R15 preserved

                       R1  =  next time to call routine
                       
                  1.6 TOGET
                  ---> called to delete an entry already on timeout list
                  ---> link on R5, with R6-R15 preserved
                       R0 = routine address
                            entry with this address will be deleted
                            
                  1.7  TONOW
                  ---> called to flush an entry, &executs it NOW!
                  ---> link on R5____no registers preserved.
                       routine address in R0
                       
                       
                  NOTE:
                  ----
                      1. when a routine is called from timeout list, it is 
                      removed from list,&must call TOPUT to be called again.
                      2. TOGET & TONOW both do normal returns,
                      even if no entry is found.

                  2. Buffer.Lib                      
                  - this package contains all code &storage allocation needed
                  for bufferlet usage.
                  - bufferlet is a chained list, with pointer pointing to the
                  nest buffer.
                  Normally, when you get some data:-
                    FG is used to maintain the ring & store in bufferlets,
                  but so not process.
                    The Bg reads the bufferlets & processes them.
                    FG will actually do some echoing.
                    --> in passing data :-
                        BG will also put data in bufferlets,
                        and FG will get them & send them 
                  - uses routines in Timout.Lib -- requires one timeout
                  list entry, may JAL   R10,CRASH on certain conditions.
                  - each routine is called with :
                     link on R4
                     R0  =  argument
                     R1  =  buffer index (buffer number*2)
                     
                  - routines are :-
                     1.  IZBF
                     ----> link on R5, used to initialize buffers
                     2. GCI
                     ----> get a character from buffer
                     3.  WCI
                     ----> write a character into buffer
                     4.  WCD
                     ----> back up a buffer to restore last character
                     5.  EMPTY
                     ----> empty (flush) buffer
                     
                     6. zap a BFR in order to reserve tank up to 1/8
                     of total BFR storage.
                     
                 3. Crash.Lib
                 - this is a generalized crash package.
                 - handles both hardware & software crashes.
                    On any crash, the registers are saved in CRREG.
                    and CRSHCT is incremented.
                    1. software crashes occur via  JAL    R10,CRASH
                    CRASH  saves (R10) in CPOINT.
                    Software crashes may be 'good' or 'bad'.
                    If 'good', the calling sequence is :
                        JAL     R10,CRASH
                         HC     0         : this key distinguishes a good
                                          : crash from a bad one.
                         BC     4*L,Y     : first byte is 4*register
                                          : linked to routines,
                                          : Y is the reason.
                    then,register (L) is saved in CFROM                      
                    & Y is saved in CRASHC
                    2. hardware failure :
                       CPOINT contains the instruction address at the time
                       of failure,
                       CRASHC contains the failure reason,
                       & CFROM is set = -1
                       
                       * on completion of crash, transfers to label START,
                       defined in the user code.
                       
                       * entering  :RCRAT,4B in NAD will dump the  crash table..
                       
                 4. Front.Lib
                 - this package is used to service the ISIS input & output 
                 rings, & to activate user code whenever a break (user 
                 defined) is encountered.
                 - it activates user code when a user-processable (user 
                 defined) non-data message is encountered, if excessive
                 data is input without a break, or if a timeout occurs
                 for a port.
                 
                 - all ISIS special messages are placed in the buffer for 
                 port 0, & each breaks automacally.
                 - for non-text messages,
                 the escape convention applies only to the message type 
                 ...the body of the message is unescaped.
                 All such messages handled by the user cause a break.
                 5. Frntnd.Lib
                 - this package is an ISIS front end interface to Tymnet.
                 - it is used to service the ISIS input ring, & to
                 activate user defined routines whenever a message is found 
                 for a port & optionally for output service when output
                 requests are pending.
                 - it is designed to permit the activation routines to be 
                 defined on an individual port basis if desired.
                 - it is also designed so that context within a process 
                 can be indicated by dynamically changing to a different
                 set of activation routines.
                 
                 In brief :-
                 1. automatic handling the dispatcher
                 2. used for many circuits coming into a slot
                 3. causes automatic backpressure application
                 & release for a port based upon comparing number of
                 characters in input buffer & Maxchar
                 4. works with Bfflet Package
                 5. tears down needle
                 6. does all the dirty work

                Supervisory calls :
                1. Kernel sets up an SVC table with starting address for 
                each SVC lookup in table as to where to begin
                2. whenver an interrupt occurs the PC and PSW are stored
                away. You get a new PSW & PC from table.
                3. you may get the results of hardware interrupts from
                some of these SVC's.
                
                ** System SVC's provide system functions, common to 
                many processes.
                
                
                -- Syscall            SVC   SYS<2>,Sysop
                - performs many operations for user
                - Sysop specifies operation to perform
                - if there is a parameter to be passed, it is passed in R0
                  (unless otherwise specified)
                - TRAP BLOCKS : Common form
                * if trap occurs, old PSW is stored at ADDR
                * R0 & R1 are saved at ADDR + 8 and ADDR + 0C
                * control is transferred to some crash routine at ADDR+010
                   In this event, special info. may be placed in R0 or R1,
                  depending on Trap condition

                1.  Restart Syscall    -    SVC   Sus,0
                    - used with own crash routine
                    - the Restart SVC causes all hardware and system traps
                      to be taken by the kernel and passed to the job,
                      rather than crashing the job
                      * Trap block adress is in R0,
                      a non-valid ADDR causes a non skip return (inst  
                      following SVC exec.),
                      valid ADDR causes skip return.
                      
                      
                Note :
                    1. to reenable Restart, user code should later execute
                    another Restart SVC,
                    ie. only good for 1 crash __  must reset.
                    If a 2nd trap occurs before the 2nd Restart SVC executes,
                    then the user program is removed from RUN queue permanently.
                    2. the crash/trap reason is in R1 
                    3. if either FG or BG crashes, they both get bumped off
                    4. the execution of a Restart Syscall will have the 
                    same effect on a running BG job as if that job had 
                    taken a system-detected crash; all Dispatcher circuits
                    will be disconnected, the FG will be halted,
                    host will be set down,
                    and the slot will be dismissed for 4 secs.




                2. Connect Foreground Syscall     SVC   Sys,1
                -- use if you want a process to run in foregraound
                -- must be called from the background.
                -- start ADDR of foreground code in R0,(first inst in FG),
                   if R0 = 0, the foreground is halted.
                   
                   
                3. Turn-on-Debug-mode  Syscall    SVC   Sys,2
                -- sets slot to debug mode
                -- can be executed from DDT,FG, or BG
                -- any crash (thru the kernel) will cause the slot to be 
                   frozen

                4. Turn-off-debug-mode Syscall      SVC    Sys,3
                -- subsequent crashes taken in normal fashion

                5. Test-debug-mode Syscall          SVC  Sys,4
                -- to test if the debug mode is on or not,
                   R0  =  0, if in debug mode
                   R0  =  0, if debug mode is not on.

                6. Freeze slot syscall            SVC   Sys,5
                -- causes BG &  F  to be frozen
                -- executable from DDT, FG or BG
                Note :                
                This freezes the slot & saves registers,
                use instead of Crash routine because it does not loop
                like the crash routine does.
                
                7. Thaw-slot Syscall              SVC   Sys,6
                -- turns off FREEZE__BG &FG will continue w/ execution
                -- can use in BG job when you detect a condition
                in your code that is not right.
                
                8. Test Freeze Syscall            SVC  Sys,7
                --  returns
                    R0  =  0, if the slot is frozen
                    R0  =  0,  if the slot is not.
                    
                9. Read-DDT-Register Syscall       SVC  Sys,8
                -- used to address one DDT register & put it in R0
                (explain Modulo)
                
                10. Read-DDT-PSD      Syscall      SVC  Sys,9

                   |
                   |
                   
                11. (27)  Set/Clear Alarm          SVC   Sys,26
                -- a timed interrupt : based on slots execution time that
                insures that a process will be trapped after a given 
                amount of time__ if it does not cancel the request.
                -- process loads a value into R0

                * request is cancelled if R0  =  0
                * tick is the number of clock ticks to be taken 
                before trapping

                Sync. I/O Control
                -----------------
                -- all I/O devices are initiated & ccontrolled by the Kernel
                -- use an SVC call to tell the kernel you are ready to 
                initiate an SVC I/O operation.
                
                
                Sync. Input control
                -------------------
                - input is via an input Ring buffer
                - you must have separate buffer for each sync. line that 
                you want to connect
                - Ring is always an even # of bytes
                - you tell slot where and how long the buffer is
                - the first halfword of the buffer will be used by the
                kernel as the next area to fill
                - the kernel updates the fill index
                - user must define & update an empty index
                - in your program:-
                    you will compare fill & empty index,
                    when they are different, you must read data.
                - the structure of the Ring
                   -----------------
                  |                 |
                  |  fill index     |

               loopback such that anything you output will be looped 
               back into your input.
               You will continuously output a 200 (hex) byte output
               buffer & you will count the zero bits you receive from
               the sync. input & continue to store this count from
               a circuit, output the zero bit count instead of 'slowc'.

                Asynchronous I/O
                ----------------
                
                - Async. is allocated in groups (of 16)
                - Async. is driven by rings (very similar to IRING & ORING),
                  handled by the Kernel.
                - Ring array :
                   1. 16 port blocks, 1 block for each port.
                   2. each block contains 2 data rings, Input & Output.
                   ---> Input ring is for input TO the slot (from the port)
                        Output ring is for output FROM the slot (to the port)

              Procedures to handle Output ring :-

                1. Filling in data
                2. Update BCT & Fill Index
                3. Add the values of BCT & TAM
                   ( TAM is initialixed to a negative number)
                   ( for 300   :-   -3,-4
                        1200   :-  -4
                        4800   :-  -8  )
                   If it is negative, keep on doing
                            positive, stop sticking data in the ring.

                  Note:
                       TAM bit array :-
                            0 bit - backpressure applied
                            1 bit - backpressure not applied
                         Tam stands for Trinsmitter Active Mask

                  1.2  Contents of Tymfile and other files
                       1.2.1  Tymfile
                          A)  Tymfiles are the files that contain the                   
                              description of the network configuration and
                              its interfaces. Each file contains statements
                              which are set according to the chosen config.
                              When a Tymfile has been completed, it will be 
                              assembled with the source and initialization 
                              files to provide the network software. Each 
                              node must have its own Tymfiles configured to
                              indicate its unique capabilities and interfaces.
                              *  Tymfiles for programs running in ISIS slots
                              will define the choices made for each of the
                              available options in these programs.
                          B)  it is recommended that a master copy of each 
                              basic type of Tymfile be maintained, as every
                              node in the network may be so unique that the 
                              user may forget all the available options or 
                              find it difficult to reconstruct a set of
                              preferred choices.
                          C)  Most of the ISIS initialization files are under
                              the SOURCE directory.
                           D) what has always been done with Tymfiles, is                                                          
                              that , we would read in an existing Tymfile 
                              applicable to our needs, & make changes as 
                              neccessary, before writing it into our own
                              named Tymfile.
                              (following the naming conventions)
                           E) Tymfile is basically a file that will be
                              processed by the NAD assembler and is
                              used to define a set of variables. These 
                              definitions are either in the form of
                              EQUATE statements or a MACRO call.
                              All programs (node code,slot code,ISIS kernel)
                              require Tymfiles to establish which options
                              are desired and what physical (or logical)
                              resources are available.
                              In this way, the user describes the physical 
                              config. of the Engine on which the code is
                              to run.

                         1.2.2 Command file (.CMD file)
                           A) designed to execute a series of NAD commands
                              to create a NIB file.
                           B) certain files must be specified in every 
                              command file for any product or job ;-
                              1.  initialization file(s)

                           C) command files for assembling specific slots 
                               on a node have
                                  Css  instead of CMD file
                                  Tss  instead of Tym specified,
                                  and Nss instead of NIB specified,
                                  where ss =  slot number
                                  
                           D) explanation of CMD file
                              -  This is the command file for the Kernel

                      - Slot 0 is always designated for node code
                      - A slot Tymfile depends on the function of the slot,
                      for ex., slot used for Tymsat would have different 
                      parameters than slot used for Gateway or Tymcom.
                      *In a node that contains the Supe, the slots are used for:-
                      RAM, VAL,and may be with other functions needed for that
                      particular Supe.(Supe might also be a gateway)

                1. Timout.Lib
                - This is a package containing the standard timeout routines.
                - Some parameters MUST be defined on entry:
                  1.1 NTOUT
                  ---> no. of timeout entries which may be active at any 
                  one time.

                  1.5 TOPUT
                  ---> any code may call this to place an entry on
                  timeout list

                  ---> called to flush an entry, &executs it NOW!
                  ---> link on R5____no registers preserved.

                  NOTE:
                  ----
                      1. when a routine is called from timeout list, it is 
                      removed from list,&must call TOPUT to be called again.
                      2. TOGET & TONOW both do normal returns,
                      even if no entry is found.

                  2. Buffer.Lib                      
                  - this package contains all code &storage allocation needed
                  for bufferlet usage.
                  - bufferlet is a chained list, with pointer pointing to the
                  nest buffer.
                  Normally, when you get some data:-
                    FG is used to maintain the ring & store in bufferlets,
                  but so not process.
                    The Bg reads the bufferlets & processes them.
                    FG will actually do some echoing.
                    --> in passing data :-
                        BG will also put data in bufferlets,
                        and FG will get them & send them 
                  - uses routines in Timout.Lib -- requires one timeout
                  list entry, may JAL   R10,CRASH on certain conditions.
                  - each routine is called with :
                     link on R4
                     R0  =  argument
                     R1  =  buffer index (buffer number*2)
                     
                  - routines are :-
                     1.  IZBF
                     ----> link on R5, used to initialize buffers
                     2. GCI
                     ----> get a character from buffer
                     3.  WCI
                     ----> write a character into buffer
                     4.  WCD
                     ----> back up a buffer to restore last character
                     5.  EMPTY
                     ----> empty (flush) buffer
                     
                     6. zap a BFR in order to reserve tank up to 1/8
                     of total BFR storage.
                     
                 3. Crash.Lib
                 - this is a generalized crash package.
                 - handles both hardware & software crashes.
                    On any crash, the registers are saved in CRREG.
                    and CRSHCT is incremented.
                    1. software crashes occur via  JAL    R10,CRASH
                    CRASH  saves (R10) in CPOINT.
                    Software crashes may be 'good' or 'bad'.
                    If 'good', the calling sequence is :
                        JAL     R10,CRASH
                         HC     0         : this key distinguishes a good
                                          : crash from a bad one.
                         BC     4*L,Y     : first byte is 4*register
                                          : linked to routines,
                                          : Y is the reason.
                    then,register (L) is saved in CFROM                      
                    & Y is saved in CRASHC
                    2. hardware failure :
                       CPOINT contains the instruction address at the time
                       of failure,
                       CRASHC contains the failure reason,
                       & CFROM is set = -1
                       
                       * on completion of crash, transfers to label START,
                       defined in the user code.
                       
                       * entering  :RCRAT,4B in NAD will dump the  crash table..
                       
                 4. Front.Lib
                 - this package is used to service the ISIS input & output 
                 rings, & to activate user code whenever a break (user 
                 defined) is encountered.
                 - it activates user code when a user-processable (user 
                 defined) non-data message is encountered, if excessive
                 data is input without a break, or if a timeout occurs
                 for a port.
                 
                 - all ISIS special messages are placed in the buffer for 
                 port 0, & each breaks automacally.
                 - for non-text messages,
                 the escape convention applies only to the message type 
                 ...the body of the message is unescaped.
                 All such messages handled by the user cause a break.
                 5. Frntnd.Lib
                 - this package is an ISIS front end interface to Tymnet.
                 - it is used to service the ISIS input ring, & to
                 activate user defined routines whenever a message is found 
                 for a port & optionally for output service when output
                 requests are pending.
                 - it is designed to permit the activation routines to be 
                 defined on an individual port basis if desired.
                 - it is also designed so that context within a process 
                 can be indicated by dynamically changing to a different
                 set of activation routines.
                 
                 In brief :-
                 1. automatic handling the dispatcher
                 2. used for many circuits coming into a slot
                 3. causes automatic backpressure application
                 & release for a port based upon comparing number of
                 characters in input buffer & Maxchar
                 4. works with Bfflet Package
                 5. tears down needle
                 6. does all the dirty work

                Supervisory calls :
                1. Kernel sets up an SVC table with starting address for 
                each SVC lookup in table as to where to begin
                2. whenver an interrupt occurs the PC and PSW are stored
                away. You get a new PSW & PC from table.
                3. you may get the results of hardware interrupts from
                some of these SVC's.
                
                ** System SVC's provide system functions, common to 
                many processes.
                
                
                -- Syscall            SVC   SYS<2>,Sysop
                - performs many operations for user
                - Sysop specifies operation to perform
                - if there is a parameter to be passed, it is passed in R0
                  (unless otherwise specified)
                - TRAP BLOCKS : Common form
                * if trap occurs, old PSW is stored at ADDR
                * R0 & R1 are saved at ADDR + 8 and ADDR + 0C
                * control is transferred to some crash routine at ADDR+010
                   In this event, special info. may be placed in R0 or R1,
                  depending on Trap condition

                1.  Restart Syscall    -    SVC   Sus,0
                    - used with own crash routine
                    - the Restart SVC causes all hardware and system traps
                      to be taken by the kernel and passed to the job,
                      rather than crashing the job
                      * Trap block adress is in R0,
                      a non-valid ADDR causes a non skip return (inst  
                      following SVC exec.),
                      valid ADDR causes skip return.
                      
                      
                Note :
                    1. to reenable Restart, user code should later execute
                    another Restart SVC,
                    ie. only good for 1 crash __  must reset.
                    If a 2nd trap occurs before the 2nd Restart SVC executes,
                    then the user program is removed from RUN queue permanently.
                    2. the crash/trap reason is in R1 
                    3. if either FG or BG crashes, they both get bumped off
                    4. the execution of a Restart Syscall will have the 
                    same effect on a running BG job as if that job had 
                    taken a system-detected crash; all Dispatcher circuits
                    will be disconnected, the FG will be halted,
                    host will be set down,
                    and the slot will be dismissed for 4 secs.




                2. Connect Foreground Syscall     SVC   Sys,1
                -- use if you want a process to run in foregraound
                -- must be called from the background.
                -- start ADDR of foreground code in R0,(first inst in FG),
                   if R0 = 0, the foreground is halted.
                   
                   
                3. Turn-on-Debug-mode  Syscall    SVC   Sys,2
                -- sets slot to debug mode
                -- can be executed from DDT,FG, or BG
                -- any crash (thru the kernel) will cause the slot to be 
                   frozen

                4. Turn-off-debug-mode Syscall      SVC    Sys,3
                -- subsequent crashes taken in normal fashion

                5. Test-debug-mode Syscall          SVC  Sys,4
                -- to test if the debug mode is on or not,
                   R0  =  0, if in debug mode
                   R0  =  0, if debug mode is not on.

                6. Freeze slot syscall            SVC   Sys,5
                -- causes BG &  F  to be frozen
                -- executable from DDT, FG or BG
                Note :                
                This freezes the slot & saves registers,
                use instead of Crash routine because it does not loop
                like the crash routine does.
                
                7. Thaw-slot Syscall              SVC   Sys,6
                -- turns off FREEZE__BG &FG will continue w/ execution
                -- can use in BG job when you detect a condition
                in your code that is not right.
                
                8. Test Freeze Syscall            SVC  Sys,7
                --  returns
                    R0  =  0, if the slot is frozen
                    R0  =  0,  if the slot is not.
                    
                9. Read-DDT-Register Syscall       SVC  Sys,8
                -- used to address one DDT register & put it in R0
                (explain Modulo)

                11. (27)  Set/Clear Alarm          SVC   Sys,26
                -- a timed interrupt : based on slots execution time that

                Sync. I/O Control
                -----------------
                -- all I/O devices are initiated & ccontrolled by the Kernel

                Sync. Input control
                -------------------
                - input is via an input Ring buffer
                - you must have separate buffer for each sync. line that 
                you want to connect
                - Ring is always an even # of bytes
                - you tell slot where and how long the buffer is
                - the first halfword of the buffer will be used by the
                kernel as the next area to fill
                - the kernel updates the fill index
                - user must define & update an empty index
                - in your program:-
                    you will compare fill & empty index,
                    when they are different, you must read data.
                - the structure of the Ring
                   -----------------
                  |                 |
                  |  fill index     |

               Bring up host & allow only 1 login  as in the previos lab.
               
               You will also connect a sync. line. It will be wired in
               loopback such that anything you output will be looped 
               back into your input.
               You will continuously output a 200 (hex) byte output
               buffer & you will count the zero bits you receive from
               the sync. input & continue to store this count from
               a circuit, output the zero bit count instead of 'slowc'.

                Asynchronous I/O
                ----------------
                
                - Async. is allocated in groups (of 16)
                - Async. is driven by rings (very similar to IRING & ORING),
                  handled by the Kernel.
                - Ring array :
                   1. 16 port blocks, 1 block for each port.
                   2. each block contains 2 data rings, Input & Output.
                   ---> Input ring is for input TO the slot (from the port)
                        Output ring is for output FROM the slot (to the port)

                       FRONT CONSOLE OPERATION




This section describes the operation of the front console.  It assumes
that the Engine is stopped, that is, the WAIT bit in the PSW is set.



2-1    UTILITY OPERATIONS


2-1.1    STOPPING THE COMPUTER

There are a number of keys which will stop the processor.  The easiest
is the [PSW] key.  Pressing the [PSW] key will stop the  computer, and
cause the console to display  the current PSW, with the WAIT  bit set,
and the current  memory address, that of  the instruction about  to be
executed.  Note that the Engine  can only be stopped if  the Keyswitch
is set to RUN mode.  If it  is in the Lock position, the keys  have no
effect.   See  "Additional  Console  Operating  Procedures"  for  more
information.


2-1.2    CLEARING THE SWITCH REGISTER

The Switch Register may be  cleared by pressing the [DTA] key.   It is
also cleared when the first digit  of a new number is entered  after a
function key is pressed.  For example, if [ADR] was pressed  to select
an address, entering the first digit of the data for that address will
clear the register.


2-1.3    ENTERING DIGITS INTO THE SWITCH REGISTER

Simply key the numbers in.  If the console was in some other mode when
the first digit is entered, it will clear, and display the contents of
the Switch Register.   The right half of  the display, along  with its
label, will flash, indicating a pending operation.


2-1.4    REPEATING AN OPERATION

Pressing [RPT] will repeat the  previous operation for as long  as the
key is pressed.

Example:  [RD] and [RPT] will repeat the read data operation  from the
          same memory  address.  [RD],[INC] and  [RPT] will  read data
          from successive memory locations.

2-2    MEMORY OPERATIONS


2-2.1    SELECTING AN ADDRESS

1.  Enter the digits of the address into the Switch Register.

2.  Press [ADR].  The console will display the address and the PSW.


2-2.2    READING FROM MEMORY

1.  Select the address as described above (Section 2-2.1).

2.  Press [RD].  This  will cause the  current memory address  and the
    data in it to be displayed.


2-2.3    WRITING INTO MEMORY

1.  Select the address as described above (Section 2-2.1).

2.  Enter the data into the Switch Register.

3.  Press [WRT].   The console will  display the selected  address and
    the data  written in.  To  check on the  correctness of  the data,
    press [RD].


2-2.4    INCREMENTING OR DECREMENTING THROUGH MEMORY

It is  possible to  read or  write to  successive memory  locations in
either ascending or descending order using the [INC] and [DEC] keys by
simply pressing [INC] for  incrementing or [DEC] for  decrementing the
current address after performing a Read or Write operation.  Each time
the key is depressed, the  current address will be decremented  by two
to  the  next half-word,  and  the  Read or  Write  operation  will be
performed again.  If either  key is pressed after any  operation other
than a Read  or Write, the console  will display a DEAD  0BAD message,
indicating that a disallowed sequence has occurred.

NOTE:  Remember that while performing an increment or decrement during
a Write operation, you are writing the contents of the Switch Register
into each successive memory location, filling the memory with the same
number.

2-4    REGISTER OPERATIONS


2-4.1    SELECTING A REGISTER SET

1.  Enter the number of the  register set you wish to select  into the
    third digit of the Switch Register.

2.  Press [SET].

NOTE:  This procedure changes the PSW.


2-4.2    SELECTING A GENERAL REGISTER

1.  Press [REG].

2.  Press the number  of the register you  wish to read from  or write
    to.  The console will display the register number and the contents
    of the register.  If [PSW] or [SET] is pushed first, the number of
    the register  set will  be displayed  on the  extreme left  of the
    console.


2-4.3    WRITING INTO A GENERAL REGISTER

1.  Select the  desired register set  and general register  within the
    set.

2.  Enter the first four (left-most) digits of the desired number into
    the Switch Register.

3.  Press [WRG].  The right-most  four digits of the  general register
    will shift left four places, and the Switch Register contents will
    copy into the right half of the general register.

4.  Enter  the  second  four  digits of  the  number  into  the Switch
    Register.

5.  Press  [WRG]  again.   The complete  new  32-bit  general register
    contents will be displayed at the console.

2-6    ADDITIONAL CONSOLE OPERATING PROCEDURES

        The  procedures above  are for  normal console  operation, are
obvious and can be  quickly learned.  There are  additional procedures
which are more  subtle, but which can  be of immense help  in hardware
trouble-shooting   or  software   debugging.   These   procedures  are
described below.


2-6.1    STOPPING THE COMPUTER

        As  previously  mentioned,  the  computer  may  be  stopped in
several ways.  Each method stops the CPU in a slightly different way.

1.  Press [PSW].  The  computer will stop IMMEDIATELY,  displaying the
    current memory address and the PSW.

2.  Press  [SGL].   The   computer  will  execute  the   next  machine
    instruction, then stop and display the current memory  address and
    data.

3.  Press [REG][N].  Select a Register.  The computer will immediately
    stop, and display  the contents of  the selected register  and its
    number.

4.  Press [RD].  The console  will display the current  memory address
    and data.  The address will not be off by two.


2-6.2    MAKING THE COMPUTER PAUSE

        Press [RPT] while the computer is running.  The  computer will
stop (pause) and the light bar  will light.  As long as [RPT]  is held
down, the console will indicate the current PSW and memory  address at
the instant [RPT] was pressed.


2-6.3    TAKING A  SAMPLE (SNAP) OF  A RUNNING MACHINE'S  LOCATION AND
         STATUS

        Press [RUN] while the  computer is running.  The  console will
show  the current  memory address  and PSW  at the  instant  [RUN] was
pressed.  The processor will  continue to run and the  console display
will change on the next console output instruction.

2-7    CONSOLE DIAGNOSTICS

        Certain console error diagnostics have been  incorporated into
the microcode in order to assist in determining the more  common types
of machine  or operator  errors.  These codes  and their  meanings are
shown in  Table 2-1.  Note  that, except  in the case  of the  Sync up
when it  should be down  and operator error  messages, that  the first
four digits are the microcode addresses of the error routines.

                        Console Error Messages


     CONSOLE CODE MEANING

     001A DEAD       Illegal  second   decode.   Possibly   caused  by
                     MAPSEL, bit 44 of the microcode, not being reset.

     0160 DEAD       Illegal ATN0 interrupt.  Usually caused by having
                     an enhanced Multi-Function Card in a machine that
                     does not have async-enhanced microcode.

     01A0 DEAD       Illegal  ATN 1  interrupt.  Caused  by  having an
                     enhanced  sync card  in a  machine that  does not
                     have sync-enhanced microcode.

     01E9 DEAD       No  SYNC  response  to  ATN2  interrupt.  Usually
                     caused  by a  broken RACK0/TACK0  chain,  or some
                     device holding ATN2  active.  In the  first case,
                     check the RACK0/TACK0 lines.  In the second case,
                     remove the I/O boards from the machine, one  at a
                     time, until the problem goes away,  thus locating
                     the offending board.

     0100 DEAD       No response to address on boot function.

     02XX DEAD       Bad status (boot function), XX= status.

     0060 DEAD       Early power down.

     01A8 DEAD       SYNC up when it should be down.

     DEAD 0BAD       Console operator error.

     0020 DEAD       Caused by  a bad interrupt  decoder on the  ROM &
                     I/O Board.

     0201 DEAD       Device unavailable.

                       THE PROGRAM STATUS WORD




The Program Status Word  (PSW) is a 16-bit  register on the ROM  & I/O
Card,  which is  used  to control  and/or  describe the  state  of the
machine.  The functions and meanings of the various bits are  shown in
Table 3-1:

program  execution  until a  new  PSW  is loaded,  with  bit  0 reset,
allowing the processor to execute instructions.

BIT 1
I/O INTERRUPT ENABLE

When  set, this  bit allows  the CPU  to acknowledge  and  service I/O
interrupts,  in conjunction  with bits  8 and  9, which  determine the
levels of  I/O interrupts  enabled.  The selection  is shown  below in
Table 3-2.

If bit 1 is reset, all I/O interrupts are disabled.

     SET     SET     SET             ATN0,ATN1, & ATN2

BIT 2
MACHINE MALFUNCTION INTERRUPT ENABLE

This bit, when  set, allows the  machine to recognize  and acknowledge
machine malfunction  interrupts.  When such  an interrupt  occurs with
bit  2  set,  the machine  enters  the  appropriate  interrupt service
routine.  If the bit is reset, the interrupt is ignored.

BIT 3
TRACE BIT

The Trace Bit is a debugging tool for software.  It can be  enabled by
a UPSW instruction (opcode D5), which is not a privileged instruction.
When  it  is  enabled,  it  causes  the  program  to  enter  a special
subroutine,  analogous to  an interrupt  service routine,  before each
jump instruction is executed.

When a jump instruction is read  in and the Trace Bit is on,  the Jump
address is stored in memory  address 14, subject to relocation  by the
MAC.  The PSW in  effect at the time  is stored in memory  address 10,
also  subject to  relocation.   The Trace  Bit  is turned  off,  and a
fullword  pointer  from user  memory  address 18  is  loaded  into the
Program  Counter.   This  address  is  the  beginning  of  the special
subroutine, whose  function is  completely up  to the  programmer.  It
might  check program  conditions, store  program addresses,  or simply
display something  on the  console.  At  the end  of the  routine, the
programmer should put in a UPSW instruction from address 10 to restore
the old PSW  and jump address, reset  the Trace Bit and  continue with
the original program.  Each  time a jump instruction is  executed with
the Trace Bit on, the above sequence will occur.

BIT 4
ASYNC-ENHANCED MICROCODE ENABLE

When Bit 4 is set,  it allows the use of the  async-enhanced microcode
instructions **SBOD, **XMIT, **SPM,  and **GCHAR.  If bit 4  is reset,
these instructions are treated as illegal instructions.

BIT 5
MEMORY RELOCATION/PROTECTION ENABLE

When set, this bit turns on the relocation and protection circuitry in
the  MAC.  All  memory accesses  are then  subject to  relocation, and
validity  checks  by the  protection  circuitry.  It  also  allows the
processor to recognize and service interrupts from the MAC.   When the
bit is reset, all relocation and protection is turned off, and  no MAC
interrupts are recognized.

BIT 6
SYNC-ENHANCED MICROCODE INTERRUPT SERVICE ENABLE

When  this  bit  is  set, it  allows  the  processor  to  service ATN1
interrupts with  the routine  in the  sync-enhanced microcode,  if the
machine has it.  If the  bit is not set, a machine  with sync-enhanced
microcode receiving an ATN1 interrupt treats it as an  ATN2 interrupt.
If a machine doesn't have sync-enhanced microcode, the setting  of bit
6 is immaterial.  If ATN1 is received the machine will die.

BIT 7
PRIVILEGED INSTRUCTION DISABLE

When this bit is set, no privileged instructions will be executed.  If
one  is  encountered, it  is  treated as  an  illegal  instruction and
creates an Illegal Instruction interrupt.  When the bit is  reset, all
privileged instructions can be executed.  The  privileged instructions
are listed below in Table 3-3:

BITS 8-11
REGISTER SET SELECT

Bits 8-11 of  the PSW are used  to select which of  the 16 sets  of 16
general registers is to be used in that portion of the  program.  Bits
8 and 9 are also used in  conjunction with bit 1 of the PSW  to enable
the various levels of I/O  interrupts, as described in the  section on
bit 1.

BITS 12-15
CONDITION CODE

The Condition  Code is  used to give  the programmer  some information
about the results of  instructions and to determine whether  jumps are
executed.  Most  user instructions change  the Condition Code  in some
way.  See the description of the instruction in Chapter 5  for details
on how it is changed.  The usual meaning of each bit in  the Condition
Code is explained below:

        BIT 12
        CARRY FLAG

        This bit is set whenever the result of an operation  is longer
        than 32 bits.

        BIT 13
        OVERFLOW FLAG

        This flag  corresponds to the  Overflow Flag on  the Interdata
        7/32, so it has the same name in the write-ups.   However, its
        function is different in the Engine.  Following any arithmetic
        instruction, the flag is set to zero.  The flag is set  when a
        false sync timeout occurs  after an I/O instruction.   A false
        sync  timeout  occurs  when an  I/O  device  is  addressed and
        doesn't respond with SYN0.

        BIT 14
        GREATER THAN ZERO FLAG

        This flag is set whenever the sign bit (most  significant bit)
        of the result is zero and there is at least one bit set in the
        result, indicating a result greater than zero.  It is also set
        when a memory parity error interrupt occurs.

        BIT 15
        LESS THAN ZERO FLAG

        This flag is set when the  sign bit of the result is  one.  If
        neither the G flag nor the L flag is set, the result was zero.

                         CHAPTER 1

                       ISIS MESSAGES



          1.1  INTRODUCTION

               ISIS was defined in order to develop, debug, and deploy
          new interfaces on network nodes while protecting these nodes
          from  possible  faults  that  might  take  place  in   these
          interfaces.

               ISIS is a system, not a programme.   It  is  a  set  of
          rules  as  to  how the interfaces are to be constructed, and
          how they are to communicate with each other.  ISIS is not  a
          TYMNET node or implementation of TYMNET technology.

               ISIS divides the machine  into  partitions,  or  SLOTS.
          Slot 0 is expected to have special properties and abilities,
          including the routing of circuits within  the  machine,  and
          the collection of diagnostic and accounting information.

               To this end, ISIS treats the TYMNET node code  as  just
          another   interface.   The  TYMNET  node  code  has  special
          properties only when executing in slot 0.  These include the
          routing  and  monitoring  functions  relating  to the TYMNET
          supervisor.  When executing in a slot other than slot 0, the
          TYMNET  interface  performs  the  function  of  a gateway to
          TYMNET.



          1.2  THE KERNEL

               The control center of ISIS is  the  KERNEL,  a  process
          which  provides  ultimate control of hardware, including the
          scheduling of other processes.

               Interrupts  have  absolute  priority  in  the  machine.
          During  intervals  when  no  interrupts  are  active,  other
          processes are active.  These are either the kernel, or  some
          process  to  which  the  kernel has temporarily assigned the
          machine.
          PART II - ISIS MESSAGES                             Page 1-2


               These processes are, for the  purposes  of  scheduling,
          independent  jobs,  even  though  a  set of processes may be
          working together, as a SLOT.  These processes  fall  into  a
          hierarchy of levels.

               The  top  level  consists  of  Foreground  (or  Quasi-)
          processes.   The  kernel  schedules  all  active  foreground
          processes to execute once every 25 milliseconds  (nominally;
          40 scheduled activities/second is guaranteed), for a maximum
          period dependent upon the number of devices  which  must  be
          serviced.  Periods are in clock ticks (1/600 second), with a
          minimum of 2 ticks, and  one  additional  tick  for  each  3
          logical  units.   These are intended to communicate with the
          interrupt level processes, and thus  must  be  scheduled  at
          frequent  intervals,  to  permit  timely responses.  To this
          end, each time the kernel tries to schedule a job, it  first
          searches  the  queue  of  foreground jobs, to find which one
          should  run  next.   If  none  should  go  immediately,  the
          time--until  the  next foreground process is to run--is made
          available to a background process.

               At the bottom level are the Background jobs.  These are
          the  work-  horses,  which  perform  the  major effort of an
          interface.   Background  jobs  actually  fall  into  several
          categories, which the kernel's scheduler treats identically.
          The Kernel divides the time-domain into  timeslices,  of  50
          milliseconds;    these  timeslices  are  interruptable  (for
          foreground execution).  A job may dismiss at any time during
          it's  timeslice  and  new  timeslice is then created for the
          next job.  If the job doesn't dismiss itself, the machine is
          taken  away  from  it  at  the end of the timeslice, and all
          other jobs are given a chance to execute  their  timeslices.
          As  a  result,  a  job  may  get  as  many  as  500  or more
          timeslices/second  (in  a   lightly-loaded   machine,   with
          well-behaved  jobs)  to  as few as 2-4, if there are several
          pathologic jobs active.

               The true background job,, is the main effort of a given
          interface.   In addition, there are a set of DDT jobs.  Each
          of these can be logged into through the network, and be used
          to  control,  modify,  debug,  or  reload  a  given  set  of
          processes (a SLOT).

               Each slot has an DDT, a foreground,  and  a  background
          job associated with it (note--not all jobs associated with a
          slot need be active concurrently).

               An intermediate  level  job  is  the  DISPATCHER.   The
          dispatcher  is run each time a true background job runs, and
          is used to set up that background job for it's next  use  of
          the  machine.   In  particular,  the dispatcher switches the
          output which was produced by that slot  to  the  appropriate
          destination slots.

               The communications center of ISIS  is  the  DISPATCHER.
          The  primary  function  of  the  dispatcher  is  to act as a
          switching center, talking to several interfaces.  Subsidiary
          functions  are to perform network accounting, and such other
          functions which it is convenient to centralize.  It does NOT
          have any knowledge of the properties of specific interfaces,
          except that the interface associated with  slot  0  has  the
          capability  to  perform  routing,  and is the repository for
          diagnostic, accounting, and other messages.

               Each interface has a set of descriptors which  it  uses
          to  talk  to  the  dispatcher,  and may have a translator to
          convert its requests and messages to  the  standard  format.
          Each  interface  runs  as one or more independent jobs under
          the  KERNEL,  sharing  time-slices  with  the  rest  of  the
          interfaces.   The  MAC  (Memory  Access Controller) prevents
          each interface from destroying another interface because  of
          illegal  memory stores.  The dispatcher checks the data flow
          to insure that, if the interface is  in  error,  it  damages
          only its own subset of circuits.

               Under the MAC, a job slot can have up to  16  segments.
          By   ISIS   convention,  segment  15d  is  readable  by  all
          processes, and contains system variables  (such  as  clocks)
          which  may  be  of interest to al processes.  Segment 14d is
          the slot's Control Table Area (CTA), which is protected from
          inadvertent  modification  by  the  slot  itself,  and which
          contains  the  descriptors  necessary  and   sufficient   to
          describe  the slot's running configuration, such as pointers
          to variables, memory layout,  etc.   The  dispatcher  shares
          segment  14d  with  the  slot, and uses these fixed cells to
          communicate with the individual jobs.  This segment is used,
          by the dispatcher, to maintain records of ongoing events.



          1.4  ISIS MESSAGE FORMAT AND STRUCTURE

               Independent processes communicate with  the  dispatcher
          via  input and output rings.  Each ring contains a string of
          MESSAGES, each of which has a  HEADER  of  standard  format.
          Each  message  starts  on  a  word  boundary.   Each ring is
          described by a collection of DESCRIPTOR cells, to permit the
          driver   and   receiver  to  synchronize  with  each  other.
          Requiring  that  messages  start  on  word  boundaries  also
          insures   that   the   header   can  be  referenced  without
          consideration of ring folding.


               Each ring descriptor has the following parameters :

                               It is the character index of the
                               next message to be filled.
                           
                          CEI  is the current empty index
                               and is half word long (2 bytes).

          Refer to the (netdvdoc:33)ISIS2.DOC for a full description
          of the message format and message types. The following is
          an abstract from that document for field debugging purposes.

              -  = Input only to slot
              +  = Output only from slot
              *  = Can be either way
          
              The first halfword is ALWAYS the port number (RPORT)
              except for Intra-ISIS communication, when the RPORT
              is ALWAYS zero.

          COMMANDS AND DEFINITIONS
          NAD is used to read  and  write  image  binary  files  which
          contain information necessary to load and dump memory images
          for TYMNET ENGINES.  These files  may  also  contain  symbol
          table  and  macro  information  so  that a user may save and
          reconstruct NAD environments for debugging purposes.
               The following is a summary of commands frequently  used
          when working on a XCOM type communication interface.
               ;X<FILE.CMD>   Will cause  subsequent  commands  to  be
                              read  from FILE.CMD.  This is especially
                              useful for assembling a series of files.
               ;;             This command allows comments in  command
                              files   or   at   command   level.   All
                              characters after the ";;" and up to  but
                              not  including  a  carriage  return  are
                              ignored except that they  are  typed  if
                              the  command  is  in a command file.  An
                              example can be found in the  first  four
                              lines of above XCOM slot command fil.
               n[SYMBOL       Sets  the  current  type-out   mode   to
                              magnitude.   It  also opens and displays
                              memory from the current program  counter
                              and leaves the memory open.
               ;@<filename>   Cause an assembly to take  place.   This
                              command is equivalent to ";A".  
               n;P<filename>  A new file, <filename>  is  created  and
                              becomes   the   current  NIB  file.   If
                              <filename> exists and n is equated to 1,
                              the  existing  file  is deleted.  If the
                              file already exists and n is zero or not
                              present,  then  the  user  is  given the
                              option of deleting the existing file  or

                              aborting the command.
               ad,cnt;P       This command appends a range  of  memory
                              image data into the NIB file.  ad is the
                              beginning address and cnt  is  the  byte
                              count.   A  typical example in the above
                              slot command file is SEG7,S7SIZE;P where
                              SEG7  is  the  address for segment seven
                              and  S7SIZE  is  the  number  of   bytes
                              assigned for the segment.
               %P             Puts state information and  all  symbols
                              except opcodes on NIB file.
               %Q             Exits NAD to  the  monitor.   Exit  also
                              occurs  if  two  successive  escapes are
                              typed.
               GL             This is a NAD symbol  control  found  in
                              the  slot  command file.  This directive
                              marks a symbol as global to all modules.
               n%F<filename>  An  existing  file  with  the  specified
                              filename  becomes  the current NIB file.
                              If n is 1 (1%F) then new information may
                              be  appended  to the file.  If n is zero
                              or not present then the file may be read
                              from   but   not  written  to.   If  the
                              <filename> does  not  exist,  a  warning
                              comment  is  issued  and  a  new file is
                              opened.
               %G             Get state information  and  all  symbols
                              from  last "%P" record of all symbols on
                              NIB file.
               ;G             Get entire NIB  memory  image  into  NAD
                              local image.
               ;C             This command is  used  to  construct  an
                              auxiliary    circuit.     It    requires
                              additional argument  consisting  of  the
                              username   string,   a   ":",   and  the
                              destination host.
               ;R             This is a hex-relay command used in  the
                              NAD     debugger-DDT     communications.
                              Succeeding pairs of  hexidecimal  digits
                              are   transmitted  as  characters.   The
                              command is  terminated  when  the  first
                              non-digit  is  entered.   An example for
ISIS__TTE.442
                              relaying the slot number to the DDT when
                              logging  into  slot  3  of  a particular
                              machine is ;R03\ where 03 is the desired
                              slot number and \ is the terminator.
               :R Addr,Cnt    Read Engine slot memory  and  print  Cnt
                              bytes    starting   a   location   Addr.
                              Example, :R Crat,4C where  Crat  is  the
                              beginning address of the crash table and
                              4C is the number of bytes in hex  to  be
                              read in the table.
               ::RR Reg,Cnt   Reads contents of Cnt registers starting
                              at Register Reg.  These are the register
                              values  at  the  time  the   last   user
                              instruction  was executed.  Example, ::R
                              R0,0F to read all sixteen  registers  in
                              this slot.
               ::H            Halts the job associated  with  a  slot.
                              This  is  a  fatal command and should be
                              used with discretion.               ::E            Execute the job associated with  a  slot
                              and starts execution independent of DDT.
                              This command initializes all  table  and
                              traces  and  should not be used during a
                              debugging session on a crashed slot.
               ::?HOST        Query host command, the  DDT  outputs  a
                              table  of  host(s)  in use by that slot.
                              Each message  gives  the  relative  host
                              number  for that slot, i.e.  0 being the
                              first relative host number.  It is  then
                              followed  by  the  actual host number in
                              decimal radix and the  number  of  ports
                              configured.   Each message is terminated
                              by one of the four  possible  states  of
                              the host.  It can be gone, down, shut or
                              answered.
               ::?USE         Query  dispatcher  buffer  usage.   This
                              command causes the DDT to output a table
                              of the ports currently  active  and  the
                              maximum  number  of  characters that the
                              dispatcher needed to buffer  because  of
                              full rings in each direction.
               ::?SLOT        This command causes the  DDT  to  output
                              the  current  slot number.  This command
                              should be used  to  ascertain  the  slot
                              connected during initial logon.
ISIS__TTE.442
               ::?Vern        This command causes the  DDT  to  output
                              the ISIS version number, followed by the
                              slot's version.  This command is used to
                              determine  if  the right version of code
                              is loaded.
               ::?HIST        This command causes the DDT to list  all
                              diagnostics  in  the  system  diagnostic
                              queue, starting  with  the  oldest,  are
                              dumped to the terminal making the query.
                              This  command  is  used   to   determine
                              historically  if  and  when the slot was
                              restarted,  crashed   or   reloaded   in
                              days:hours:minutes:seconds.
               ::?PORT        This command causes the DDT to list  the
                              users  of  the  Kernel  ports.  The port
                              sending this query command should have a
                              * adjacent to the port number printed.
               ::?HANG N      From time to time, it  is  necessary  to
                              enter  into  a  slot  which  is  already
                              connected to another kernel port.   This
                              is  likely  to happen when another field
                              consultant is logging into  the  desired
                              slot  without your consent or if the aux
                              circut to  this  slot  was  accidentally
                              broken  previously.   To  re-gain access
                              into   desired   slot,   log   into   an
                              unoccupied  slot  in the same Engine and
                              enter the ::?PORT command  to  find  out
                              the  kernel  port  number other than the
                              one with the * adjacent  to  it.   Enter
                              ::?HANG  N  where  N is the other kernel
                              port number in order to  break  the  aux
                              circuit  for  this  port.   It  is  then
                              possible to re-enter the desired slot by
                              doing  ::^M  where M is the desired slot
                              number.
               ::^M           A command to transfer control  from  the
                              DDT  of  the slot currently logged into,
                              to the slot specified by M as  explained
                              above.

               ^Z^Z           A Zap command to log off from the  slot.
                              Where  ^Z  is  control key + key Z.  The
                              second ^Z is a confirmation to  the  DDT
                              of the intention of logging off from the
                              slot.
               :\             This  is  a   NAD-Kernel   communication
                              command     to     recover    from    an
                              unrecognizable command.  It is therefore
                              used effectively to restart a DDT.  
               NUM_           Underscore sets  the  current  type  out
                              mode  to  symbolic  mode.  It is used to
                              determine  the  symbol  associated  with
                              NUM.   Where  NUM  is  a location in the
                              slot.  Example, 1A65A_  gives  TRC010+08
                              which   is  a  location  in  the  Record
                              teardown logic module.
               SYM[           Sets  the  current  type-out   mode   to

                              in hex.   Example,  SECN2B[  gives  7310
                              where   SECN2B   is   a  symbol  in  the

                Basically , there are two ways to get the contents of the 
                slot crash information.

                1.  If the engine is still running, but the slot is crashed.
                
                  1. get into the slot with NAD.
                  2. if there is any message printed out upon entering the slot,
                     write it down for later reference.
                  3. do a ::?VERN to get the version number of both the 
                     slot and of ISIS.
                  4. do a ::?HIST to see if the slot has been crashing 
                     frequently in the recent past.
                  5. try to determine what esternal circumstances preceded                     
                     the crash.
                  6. record the results.
                  7. if CRSTOP has been set, dump the slot with LOADII and 
                     restart the slot. always attach the symbol table from the 
                     corresponding NIB file to the dump file soon after
                     the dump is complete.
                  8. if CRSTOP has not been set, look at the crash table.
                  9. if the crash code is 10 (dispatcher crash).
                      1. try to determine the circumstances preceding the
                      crash.
                      2. try to reproduce the crash.
                      3. if the crash cannot be reproduced, enable CRSTOP 
                      and BUFTRC and get a dump of the slot after the next
                      crash.
                  10.if the crash code is 14 (protection violation), or if
                     the crashes occur frequently, see if the cause of the 
                     crash can be determined solely from the crash table.
                     
                     Things that you should be getting from the crash
                     table :
                      1. crash count,
                      2. crash type,
                      3. crash location, specified as a label plus displacement,
                      4. locations of executable code contained in the reg.,
                         specified as a label plus displacement.



                  IF THE SLOT SHOWS NO RESPONSE:
                      ---> user and/or host receives no response,
                      IRING/ORING pointers do not move, even though user/host
                      claims to be sending data,
                      
                      1. get into the slot with NAD.
                      2. if a message is printed out upon entering the slot,
                         write it down for later reference.
                      3. use DDT to check CPU usage to see if the slot is 
                         using an abnormally large amount of CPU. The slot
                         may be caught in a loop.
                      4. check IRING/ORING pointers to see if they are 
                         unequal. If they are unequal and remain so,
                         the code may be caught in a loop.
                      5. check the background and foreground PSD to see if 
                         the address changes. If things are moving slow 
                         enough to see the address change, you've located 	
                         the code area caught in a loop.
                      
                         1. take some sample readings of the PSD that is 
                         moving and determine the locations (label plus
                         displacement) to which they refer.
                         
                         2. go to the appropriate source listing and examine 
                         the area of code that is having the problems. 
                         Try to determine what could be causing the code to 
                         loop.
                         
                         3. submit your findings to your tech sup. rep.
