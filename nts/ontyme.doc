                ONTYME TRANSFER

THIS PROGRAM IS USED TO TRANSFER FILES FROM A PDP10 HOST TO AN
ONTYME MESSAGE SWITCH SYSTEM. ALL TEXT IS TRANSFERED WITHOUT
TRANSLATION. IN THIS MANNER THE FILE CAN CONTAIN BOTH TEXT AND
COMMANDS.

THE PROGRAM IS LOCATED ON SYSTEMS 25,28,29,33,34,39,65.

TO RUN THE PROGRAM TYPE:

-GO (CES)ONTYME <CR>

THE FIRST QUESTION IS:

ENTER ONTYME NAME:

ANSWER WITH A VALID ONTYME NAME. IF THERE IS NO PERIOD IN THE INPUT
STRING TYPE CHARACTERS 'TYM.' WILL BE INSERTED IN FRONT OF THE NAME.
ALSO IF A SEMI-COLON IS FOUND IN THE INPUT STRING, IT AND ALL PRECEDING
CHARACTERS WILL BE USED AS THE USERNAME IN PLACE OF 'EMSAA;'.
(EXAMPLE: EMSBB;USER   WILL USE 'EMSBB;' TO LOGIN AND USE 'TYM.USER'
AS THE ONTYME NAME.

THE SECOND QUESTION IS:

ENTER PASSWORD:

ANWSER WITH THE VALID PASSWORD. (PASSWORDS MAY NOT CONTAIN TRAILING
SPACES!!!)

THE ONLY QUESTION ASKED AFTER THIS IS:

ENTER FILE NAME:

ANSWER WITH A VALID FILE NAME (UPPER CASE CHARACTERS ONLY). THE FILE
WILL BE TRANSFERED. WHEN COMPLETE, THE FILE NAME WILL BE REQUESTED
AGAIN. WHILE THE THE FILE IS BEING TRANFERED THE PROGRAM WILL COUNT
LINES IN THE FILE. AFTER EVERY 25 LINES THE MESSAGE:

SENT: XXXX

WILL BE PRINTED. XXXX = NUMBER OF LINES TRANSFERED. WHEN THE FILE IS
COMPLETED A MESSAGE WILL BE PRINTED CONTAINING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF
LINES IN THE FILE.

A SECOND OPTION IS TO ENTER A PERCENT SIGN (%) FOLLOWED BY A TEXT
STRING. THE TEXT FOLLOWING THE PERCENT WILL BE SENT TO THE ONTYME
SYSTEM. THIS IS USEFUL FOR SENDING COMMANDS NOT CONTAINED IN
