               VADIC OUTDIALER MODEM TESTING PROCEDURE
**************************************************************************

      THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS ARE FOR THE TESTING OF THE OUTDIALER
BY USING A TERMINAL.
     AFTER IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED WHICH OUTDIALER IS SUSPECTED TO BE BAD
DO THE FOLLOWING;
***************************************************************************
     YOU WILL NEED A TERMINAL THAT COMMUNICATES AT 300 BAUD ASCII WITH
EVEN PARITY.
     THE CABLE TO CONNECT THE TERMINAL TO THE MODEM NEEDS TO BE A
STANDARD EIA TO MODEM TYPE. THIS WOULD BE AN ASC 140-02.
***************************************************************************


     1.WITH DTR ON AND NO RING INDICATE (RI) PRESENT THE MODEM IS IN DIAL
MODE. THE MODEM WILL TURN ON CTS TO THE TERMINAL. (IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT
THE MODEM IS NOT OFF HOOK AND COULD ATTEMPT TO ANSWER IF RI GOES TRUE.)
     2.THE TERMINAL SENDS AN ASCII "1" WHICH CONDITIONS THE MODEM TO 
RECEIVE A TELEPHONE NUMBER. IF DIALING OUT ON AN EXTENSION AN ASCII "9"
WILL NEED TO PRECEED THE NUMBER. IF ANY CHARACTER OTHER THAN CONTROL "A"
OR THE TELEPHONE NUMBER IS RECEIVED BY THE MODEM AN ERROR MESSAGE WILL
OCCUR (ERR 1). THE CONTROL "A" CAUSES THE MODEM TO PRINT THE SETTINGS OF
ITS OPTION SWITCHES. THESE ARE THE MODEM CONFIGURATION SWITCHES.
     3.NOW ENTER THE TELEPHONE NUMBER TO BE DIALED FOLLOWED BY A CARRIAGE
RETURN. THE CHARACTER "K" EMBEDDED IN THE TELEPHONE NUMBER WILL INDICATE
A TANDEM DIAL TONE. SUCH AS HAVING TO DIAL "9"" TO GET OUT. THIS SIMPLY
INTRODUCES AN ADDITIONAL DELAY. AN EXAMPLE OF THIS WOULD BE
9K4461470, VERSUS 4461470 IF YOU WERE ABLE TO DIAL OUT DIRECTLY. ANY
CHARACTER OTHER THAN "K" OR THE TELEPHONE NUMBER WILL CAUSE AN ERROR (ERR 4).
IF THIS OCCURS RETURN TO STEP 2 AND PROCEED FROM THERE AGAIN.
     4.AFTER DETECTING A CARRIAGE RETURN THE MODEM WILL ECHO THE
REQUESTED TELEPHONE NUMBER TO THE TERMINAL.
     5.IN ORDER TO READ THE OPTION SWITCH SETTINGS ON THE MODEM AN ASCII
"1" IS ENTERED AS IN STEP 2 BUT IS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY A CARRIAGE
RETURN. THESE SWITCHES CONTAIN THE PREPROGRAMMED TELEPHONE NUMBER.
     6.AFTER SENDING THE NUMBER TO BE DIALED BACK TO THE TERMINAL THE
MODEM GOES OFF HOOK AND DIALS THE NUMBER. DIALING CAN BE TERMINATED
HERE BY ENTERING AN ASCII "1" AT THIS TIME. IF THIS IS DONE THE
MODEM GOES BACK ON HOOK AND RETREAT TO STEP THREE.
     7.ONCE THE MODEM DETECTS ANSWER TONE FROM THE REMOTE IT WILL SEND
A "CONN" MESSAGE TO THE TERMINAL AND TRANSFER TO THE DATA MODE. THE
MODEM WILL REMAIN IN THE DATA MODE AS LONG AS DTR STAYS TRUE, OR IF THE
LOSS OF CARRIER OPTION IS ON UNTIL  CARRIER IS LOST FOR 1 SECOND. IF THE
MODEM DROPS BECAUSE OF CARRIER LOST IT WILL SEND A "LOC DISC" MESSAGE TO
THE TERMINAL.
     8.IF THE MODEM DETECTS A BUSY SIGNAL WHEN CALLING IT WILL SEND A
"BUSY" MESSAGE TO THE TERMINAL.
     9.IF THE MODEM DID NOT DETECT EITHER ANSWER TONE OR A BUSY SIGNAL
IT WILL SEND AN "ACR" (ABANDON CALL RETRY ?) MESSAGE TO THE TERMINAL AFTER
A PREPROGRAMMED DELAY OF FROM 9 TO 90 SECONDS. THIS DELAY IS SWITCH
SELECTABLE IN THE MODEM. IF AN "ACR" MESSAGE IS RECEIVED REMEMBER
THE MODEM IS STILL OFF HOOK. TO GO BACK ON HOOK EITHER ENTER AN ASCII
"1" OR DROP DTR.
     10.IF THE MODEM ATTEMPTS TO DIAL IN A MODE WHERE DIAL TONE
DETECTION IS REQUIRED (SWITCH OPTIONAL) AND DIAL TONE IS NOT DETECTED
WITHIN 8 SECONDS THE MODEM WILL SEND A "CANT" MESSAGE TO THE TERMINAL.
     11.IF THE SINGLE NUMBER AUTO DIAL FEATURE HAS BEEN DISABLED BY
SWITCH OPTION AND THE TERMINAL ATTEMPTS TO DIAL THE PRE-PROGRAMMED NUMBER
STORED IN THE OPTION SWITCHES BY ENTERING "1 CR", THE MODEM WILL
RESPOND BY SENDING A "NUMBER?" PROMPT TO THE TERMINAL,
REQUESTING THE NUMBER BE LOADED VIA THE TERMINAL KEYBOARD.
     12.IF THE ANALOG LOOPBACK SWITCH ON THE MODEM CHASSIS HAS BEEN
TURNED ON AND THE TERMINAL ATTEMPTS TO EXECUTE AN AUTO DIAL SEQUENCE
THE MODEM WILL SEND A "PORT BUSY" MESSAGE TO THE TERMINAL.
     13.IF THE TERMINAL INTERROGATES THE MODEM TO DETERMINE THE STATUS
OF THE OPTION SWITCHES BY SENDING A CONTROL "A" BEFORE PROCEEDING TO DIAL
THE MODEM WILL RETURN A"SW=(#,#,...#)" MESSAGE TO THE TERMINAL LISTING THE
SETTING OF ALL 16 OPTION SWITCHES.

           THIS IS A TABLE OF THE MODEMS MESSAGES AND THEIR MEANINGS

  MESSAGE                           MEANING

CONN       ANSWER TONE DETECTED, MODEM NOW IN DATA MODE.

ACR?       NEITHER ANSWER TONE NOR BUSY SIGNAL DETECTED ON CALL.

BUSY       A BUSY SIGNAL HAS BEEN DETECTED.

CANT       DIAL TONE HAS NOT BEEN DETECTED WHEN REQUIRED.

LOC DISC   LOSS OF CARRIER DISCONNECT.

PORT BUSY  MODEM IS IN MANUAL ANALOG LOOPBACK WHEN AUTO DIAL SEQUENCE
           IS ENTERED.
SW=        RESPONSE GIVEN TO AN INQUIRY ON OPTION SWITCH STATUS.

NUMBER?    RESPONSE GIVEN WHEN THE SINGLE NUMBER DIALER IS DISABLED
           AND THAT SEQUENCE IS ENTERED.
ERR 1      RESPONSE GIVEN TO AN INCORRECT START DIGIT.

ERR 2      RESPONSE GIVEN TO A BUFFER OVERFLOW CONDITION.

ERR 3      RESPONSE GIVEN TO A PARITY ERROR.

ERR 4      RESPONSE GIVEN TO AN INVALID CHARACTER RECEIVED.
****************************************************************************
               BUSY OUT CONTROL

     THE BUSY OUT INTERFACE LEAD (EIA PIN 25) IF TURNED ON BY THE TERMINAL
WILL CAUSE THE MODEM TO GO OFF HOOK AND PRESENT A CIRCUIT BUSY CONDITION
TO THE TELEPHONE NETWORK. IF DTR IS ALSO TURNED ON THE MODEM WILL ENTER
ANALOG LOOPBACK AS WELL AS BUSY OUT.
