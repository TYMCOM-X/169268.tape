
  I have up-graded the following Dialog Trirock Rotaries to Version
2.06:
	Palo Alto		63 modems	6-29-88
	San Francisco		15 modems	7-9-88
	San Jose		10 modems	7-7-88
	Oakland			13 modems	7-8-88

  I have tested all the sites and had dialog run their Rotary test
program to confirm all the modems are working. All the sites look good.
Dialog acknowledges this also.
