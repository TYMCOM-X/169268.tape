          IMPLEMENTATION CHANGES
          Tymnet understands the addition of Hong Kong as a major node in  Phase
          I.   There  will  be no change in delivery schedule.  The only pricing
          change will be to move the cost of the Hong Kong node to Phase I.


          MANDATORY FEATURES

          Tymnet notes that these features are now considered mandatory.  As was
          previously  stated  in  the  proposal submitted to CITIBANK by Tymnet,
          Tymnet is in  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  each  of  these
          features.

          DESIRABLE FEATURES

          Tymnet  understands  the  following  features   are   now   considered
          desirable.

               F.1.16.7.5.C Auto Disconnect

          This is generally a host function, however, there is a  "time  out  on
          inactivity"  option  available  for  the  Asynchronous  TYMCOM, and an
          inactivity time is under development for X.25.


               F.1.16.7.5.G Camp-on

          Tymnet does not currently support Camp-on.  However, Tymnet is willing
          to  enter  into  negotiations  with  CITIBANK  for development of this
          feature.


               F.1.16.7.10.J Multi-Destination Broadcast

          Multi-destination/broadcast routing is not a network feature except to
          the  limited  extent  that  a  remote  messages  feature  is possible.
          Remotes (TYMSATS) may have a canned messages which are sent  to  users
          when  they  log  in.   Short of this limited feature, only the message
          switch has broadcast message capabilities.


          FEATURES ELIMINATED

          Tymnet understands that the following features have been eliminated.

               F.1.16.8.2.2     Synchronization
                     -8.2.3     Equalization
                     -10.2      WIN Performance Sensitivity

          Terminal to terminal communication will be supported  by  the  end  of
          1982.  Async ASCII support is currently available in speeds down to 75
          baud.  50 baud ASCII is not currently supported, it could be  provided
          with  enhancement to existing hardware.  Hence, if terminal speeds are
          compatible, or if higher speed terminals can accept backpressure  from
          the  network,  Tymnet does not forsee any difficulty in supporting the
          FEXNET/MEXNET application as described.

          I.  Management


          1.  Question:  How many people are  actively  engaged  with  (Identify
          independently for hardware and software):

                                             Software          Hardware
               Product Maintenance               53               130
               New Product Development           95                41
               Product Enhancement
               Product customization
               Customer Support

          Answer :  Tymnet's Network Technologies Division (NTD) is  responsible
          for  product  development and enhancement.  A staff of 95 develops and
          supports software products;  a staff of 41 is  dedicated  to  hardware
          development.   In  all  cases,  NTD  continues product enhancement and
          support for the life of the product.

          Field  support  of  the  hardware  is  the  responsibility  of  Tymnet
          Communications  Maintenance, currently a staff of 130 located in field
          offices throughout the Continental U. S..

          Field support  of  network  software  consists  of  53  Communications
          Consultants  located  in  various  offices  throughout the Continental
          U. S..

          Product customization  can  be  performed  by  NTD  or  Communications
          Consultants  depending upon whether the customization requires changes
          in the code or selection of one or  more  of  a  range  of  acceptable
          parameters applicable to each interface.


          2.  Question:  Please identify by name  project  manager  and  include
          detailed resume.

          Answer:  The individual tentatively selected as the project manager is
          Larry  Snyder.   Larry  has  been  with  Tymnet two years where he has
          gained considerable experience in Tymnet technology while  serving  as
          Technical  Manager  for the Atlantic Area.  This area encompasses most
          of the geographical area east of the Mississippi River  and  south  of
          New York City, and includes New York City.  In this capacity Larry was
          responsible for coordinating  all  new  installations  on  the  public
          network,  the  correct operation of all software, and coordinating the
          activities of software personnel with hardware maintenance  personnel.
          A detailed resume will be provided under separate cover.


          3.  Question:  What are your staffing plans for this project (break it
          out  by  geographical  regions),  and  how  soon  will  you be able to
          assemble the team?  Do current corporate commitments require  external
          recruiting or will only in-house personnel be used.  

          Answer:  Appendix A describes the support plan for CITIBANK.  Most  of
          the  staffing  requirements  can  be  met  by  existing resources with
          external recruiting being done only where necessary.  The team will be
          assembled within 30 days of contract award.

          4.  Question:  If you have not already done so please supply the  name
          and   telephone   number  of  a  senior  level  person  on  a  similar
          installation  using  the  proposed  equipment.   Two  references   are
          required.

          specified as mandatory requirements in Section F are:

               - Off The Shelf
               - Require Fine Tuning/Customization
               - Require New Development

          Answer:  The following features proposed for WIN and specified as
          mandatory requirements are "Off The Shelf" features within the limits
          described in Tymnet's original RFP.

               -10.10.4  Failure Recovery

          There are no mandatory features proposed for WIN  which  require  fine
          tuning/customization.   It  is  noted  that  in  generating code for a
          specific interface  several  options  may  be  set  that,  in  effect,
          customize  that interface for that application.  This does not require
          development effort however.

          Those features described as mandatory requirements  proposed  for  WIN
          which require new development are listed below.

               F.1.16.3.4       Directory Look-up Facility
                     -5.5       DEC's DDCMP
                     -5.6       FAP Protocol
                     -5.7       SWIFT, BANKWIRE, CHIPS, FEDWIRE
                     -9.4.2     Automatic Loss-of-Crypto Synchronization or
                                Failure Detection
                     -9.4.3     Automatic Cryptographic Resynchronization
               F.6              Asynchronous to 3270 protocol conversion
                                   for some terminals 
                                CASE DCX850 emulation
                                Log-on Menu Facilities

          The mandatory features required in  F.1.16.7.9  "Queueing  Dispatching
          and  Congestion  Control"  are  not  applicable  to Tymnet technology.
                                                                          Page 6


          Store-and-Forward Lock-up is  not  applicable  to  Tymnet  technology.
          With  respect  to  Inter-nodal Throttling, traffic is backpressured as
          necessary.

          Tymnet does not permit log off at  the  application  level.   However,
          when  a  user  logs  off  one  host  the  network  will  prompt for an
          additional log in, without  requiring  the  user  to  redial  a  call.
          (Section F.1.16.3.3)

          6.  Question:  Based upon your experience what  do  you  view  as  ob-
          stacles to the successful implementation of WIN.

          Answer:  Based  on  past  experience  several  problem  areas  can  be
          identified that will require careful coordination between the CITIBANK
          project team and the Tymnet project team.   These  problem  areas  are
          summarized below.

               -LOGISTICS/SCHEDULING

               Logistical and scheduling problems will arise.  Typical of  these
               are  ensuring  that  equipment,  facilities, and associated items
               such as modems, telephone lines, etc.  are ready and available at
               the  proper  place and time.  These problems will be magnified by
               the fact that WIN is an international network.

               -COMMUNICATIONS

               An effective means of, and channels for,  communication  must  be
               established.   In  addition,  it  is  essential that CITIBANK and
               Tymnet understand the full requirements for WIN and its impact on
               CITIBANK.   CITIBANK  must learn about Tymnet, TYMNET technology,
               what TYMNET can and cannot do, and how best to use TYMNET to meet
               CITIBANK'S networking needs.

               Tymnet must become more familiar with all  CITIBANK  applications
               so as to properly advise CITIBANK concerning the WIN.

               -DEVELOPMENT

               Tymnet  must  develop  some  interfaces   to   support   specific
               requirements  for CITIBANK.  Cooperation will be required by both
               parties  in  order  to  ensure  timely  development  of  suitable
               interfaces.   In  addition,  CITIBANK should consider alternative
               means that may eliminate the requirement for  development;   e.g.
               use of DEC X.25 in lieu of DDCMP.

               -SOFTWARE

               Tymnet software has been designed to support a  wide  variety  of
               requirements.   The  full  impact  of  these requirements must be
               investigated in order to generate the interfaces to meet CITIBANK
               requirements.   Insofar  as possible a standard interface profile
               should be developed for all WIN applications.  Procedures must be
               developed   that  will  expedite  the  introduction  of  improved
               versions of code to the WIN.  

               -HARDWARE

               The installation and  maintenance  of  hardware  is  of  concern.
               Tymnet hardware has proven itself reliable in public network use,
               however, from time to time problems are encountered that  require
               time  to  resolve.   Coordination  is  essential.   In  addition,
               hardware upgrades to add capacity or improve performance must  be
                                                                          Page 7


               anticipated so that the necessary hardware is available where and
               when required.

               -NETWORK EXPANSION

               Future growth of the network must be  anticipated  and  carefully
               planned  and coordinated.  This is a joint effort.  CITIBANK must
               understand various options and their impact  on  network  growth.
               An overall expansion strategy and plan must be developed early in
               the project and reviewed periodically.  


          7.  Question:  What is the life  cycle  of  this  product?   Will  you
          continue  support  of  this  product  during  the  WIN  life  cycle of
          approximately ten years?

          Answer:  Tymnet's networking technology and its concept of  modularity
          provide  an unlimited life cycle for the network proposed to CITIBANK.
          This product is designed to be upward compatible.  (See Section  F.1.6
          'Modularity/Expandability'   of   the  proposal.)  Tymnet  support  is
          on-going.  Tymnet will support this product during the WIN life  cycle
          of approximately ten years.


          8.  Question:  What is your corporate commitment to WIN in  particular
          if any subcontractor is delinquent or becomes financially insolvent?

          Answer:  Tymnet will  provide  suitable  relief  to  CITIBANK  if  any
          subcontractor becomes delinquent or financially insolvent.


          II.  TECHNICAL


          1.  Question :  Do you support a centralized or a decentralized NMC?

               If decentralized, can an NMC from another region or the main  NMC
               take  control  upon  failure  of a regional NMC?  Can you support
               back-up for the main NMC?

               If centralized, do you support a back-up NMC?

               If you support back-up, please outline procedures and  switchover
               time.  Is the back-up hot, warm, or cold?

          Answer :  Tymnet supports a centralized NMC with a hot  back-up.   The
          Tymnet  network  is  controlled  by  a  software  package  called  the
     Supervisor.  Supervisors have been proposed in New  York  and  London.
          Either  Supervisor  may  control  the  network.  Should one Supervisor
          fail, the other Supervisor automatically takes control of the network.
          The  average  takeover time is ten to twenty seconds for a network the
          size of WIN.  During the takeover, no new  logins  can  be  processed.
          However,  existing  users  continue  to  function  normally.  Operator
          intervention is not required.  For more details see Tymnet's  response
          to Section G.9.1 following.


          2.  Question :  If you have not already done so, please quote a  price
          for win network FAP emulation as specified in Appendix 1 of RFP.

          Answer :

          FAP may be introduced  in  WIN  as  a  simple  asynchronous  permanent
                                                                          Page 8


          virtual  circuit,  with  all specific protocol handling and end-to-end
          considerations left to the attached FAP host processors.   The  Tymnet
          transport  technology,  augmented by the rebuild feature, will provide
          reliable FAP message delivery.

          Performance concerns may dictate implementation of FAP  as  a  network
          protocol with local acknowledgements.  There is technical concern over
          the end-to-end processing of a "fatal nack" message, and definition of
          the criteria for a "well formatted" message.

          Assuming that the "fatal  nack"  and  "well  formatted"  criteria  are
          reasonably  constrained,  Tymnet proposes to implement FAP as a native
          mode transport protocol through WIN, using custom  FAP  job  slots  in
          appropriate  Tymnet  Engines  in  WIN.  End-to-end connections will be
          established  using  permanent  virtual  circuits  defined  at   system
          generation time.

          Development will be firmly scheduled  upon  completion  of  a  General
          External  Design document by NTD and approval of that GED by CITIBANK.
          Prior to initiation of the design effort,  CITIBANK  must  supply  the
          message   format   criteria   and   a   sample  Datascope  tape  of  a
          representative FAP protocol exchange.

          Development will be done on a time and materials basis, not to  exceed
          eight  development  months  including  design.  Development months are
          priced  at  $15,000  per  month,  including  all  Tymnet   development
          resources.   CITIBANK  must  supply the unique FAP testing environment
          and specification approvals.  A beta test version of the FAP interface
          will  be delivered within eight months of approval of the GED.  Tymnet
          will endeavor to accelerate this development to  the  extent  possible
          without compromising normal development standards.


          3.  Question :  When do you plan to support the OSI Level 4  Transport
          Layer as recently recommended in Tokyo by the ISO?

          Answer :  

          The design and implementation of Tymnet technology is fully compatible
          with the OSI Reference Model.  Specific implementation through level 3
          (e.g.  1980 CCITT X.25) is currently  offered  as  a  standard  Tymnet
          product.

          Particular products and features may be  used  to  illustrate  partial
          implementation of function at higher levels.  Current examples include
          the OnTyme message switch,  and  the  3270  Virtual  Host  capability.
          Tymnet  is  committed  to  enhance  and  expand  the implementation of
          network products which interface with and  directly  support  the  OSI
          model, and specific implementation standards within the model.

          We have reviewed the Level 4 Transport recommendation from Tokyo,  but
          have  not  evaluated  its  implementation in the context of a specific
          application.  We are anxious to  discuss  with  CITIBANK  the  network
          requirements for such a service in a commercial application framework.
          Additional input will be solicited  from  the  Tymnet's  European  PTT
          customers, focused on their basic error recovery needs.

          Within Tymnet, data integrity is  entrusted  to  the  network.   Thus,
          implementation  of  basic services, and possibly of multiplexing, will
          be considered.  Classes 0 and 1  are  likely  candidates  for  network
          implementation,  classes  2  and  3  may  be most appropriate for host
          implementation (ECMA interest) but may involve network components, and
          class 4 clearly applies to attached computer systems (special interest
                                                                          Page 9


          of U.S.  computer manufacturers).

          It is anticipated that a transport service will be  implemented  as  a
          Tymnet  product,  though  no one recommendation has gained approval or
          predominant acceptance.  An external design or implementation schedule
          have not yet been established.  


          4.  Question :  Specify your support or lack thereof of V.35, V.36.

          Answer :  Tymnet supports V.35.  Tymnet provides  for  circuit  number
          108  (DTR), but not number 106 (CTS).  Tymnet does not provide for use
          of the 37-pin connector required for V.36.   However,  as  allowed  by
          CCITT  recommendation  V.36, by use of an adapter cable to convert the
          V.35 34-pin connector to the V.36 37-pin  connector,  support  can  be
          provided  for  V.36.  Tymnet does not provide for circuit numbers 106,
          140, 141, or 142.


          5.  Question :  Please outline staffing requirements for each node and
          for the NMC.  Indicate required level of expertise.

          Answer :  Nodes, other than the NMC, do not require staffing since all
          network  activities  are centrally controlled.  In order to provide 24
          hour, 7 days-per-week coverage 15  personnel  are  recommended.   This
          will  provide  for  three  shits  of three personnel each plus a spare
          three person shift to cover weekends, vacations, holidays,  etc.   The
          remaining  three  personnel would be the NMC supervisor, assistant NMC
          supervisor, and an administrative aid.  Each shift would have a  shift
          supervisor, one of the three persons per shift.

          The NMC supervisor should be  an  experienced  person  with  extensive
          knowledge  of  data communications in general and Tymnet technology in
          particular.   Two  to  three  years  experience  is  preferred.    The
          assistant NMC supervisor should have data communications knowledge and
          experience and some knowledge of Tymnet.  One to two years  experience
          is  desired.   The  administrative  assistant  should be knowledgeable
          concerning Tymnet;  in particular the accounting and  user  validation
          functions and procedures.  The shift supervisor should understand data
          communications and have experience with  Tymnet.   One  to  two  years
          experience  is  desired.  The remaining personnel on each shift should
          have some data communications knowledge and experience.  At least  one
          should  have  some  experience with a Tymnet network.  One could be an
          entry level person with data communications experience.


          6.  Question :   Are  subscriber  passwords  stored  in  the  network?
          Where?  In the clear and under whose control?

          Answer :  Subscriber passwords are stored  in  the  network  on  disks
          attached  to  each Supervisor node.  The validation program writes the
          user name and password to the Controlling User  Directory  (CUD)  then
          copies  the  user  names  to  the  Master  User Directory (MUD) on all
          network Supervisors.  Passwords are stored in an encrypted form.  When
          a  user  name is initially set up control of the password may be given
          to the user or control may be restricted to the group responsible  for
          performing validations.


          7.  Question :  Can network operation privileges be assigned?

          Answer :  Network operation privileges can be assigned.  Users needing
          network  operation  privileges  can be validated to use PROBE or TMCS.
                                                                         Page 10


          Different status levels can be assigned depending on the user's  need.
          Assignment  of network operation privileges should be under control of
          a select group of personnel at the NMC.  The PROBE manual, provided in
          Tymnet's  response  to  the RFP, provides a list of PROBE commands and
          the status level  needed  to  use  that  command.   The  TMCS  manual,
          provided  with  this  response,  lists  the  TMCS  commands and status
          levels.


          8.  Question :  CITIBANK requires that WIN subscribers be  capable  of
          accessing  the  WIN  network at any access point.  This implies that a
          given subscriber who normally accesses WIN at node X is  also  capable
          of accessing WIN at node Y.  Does your proposal allow for this?

          Answer :  Tymnet's validation program permits users  to  be  validated
          such  that  they  may  access the network from any node.  In addition,
          users may be permitted access from only certain nodes.


          III.  MAINTENANCE/SUPPORT


          1.  Question :  Clarification of Maintenance

               What type of maintenance is available:

               -  Local
               -  Remote, from where_______
               -  Direct (Vendor)
               -  Subcontractor
               -  Area of maintenance geographic responsibility

          Answer :

               - Local 

                    See page 10 to Part 5 of Tymnet's response to the RFP.

               - Remote

                    Remote support is provided from the nearest local city.

               - Direct (vendor) support

                    Provided for Continental U. S..

               - Subcontractor

                    Provided in most international locations other than Europe.

               - Geographic Responsibility

                    Provided by nearest local office.  In the Continental  U. S.
                    service  is  divided  into  three major areas, each with 2-4
                    sub-areas.  In Europe, there  is  one  major  area  and  one
                    sub-area.  Other areas are third-party agreements.

          In addition, see Section 5.2 to Appendix A.


          2.  Question :  MTTR 

          Mean Time To Repair, the commitment to the maximum time  to  repair  a
                                                                         Page 11


          fault on site.

          Answer :  From the time the field engineer arrives on-site, four hours
          is  usual  with  most  repairs taking around two hours.  Site arrival,
          from time of notification is 2-4 hours if within a local service  area
          (50-75 miles) and 24 hours if outside the local service area.


          3.  Question :  Maintenance Staffing 

          Please  outline  the  number  of  packet  switch  network  maintenance
          personnel, and the number of existing systems being maintained at each
          location.

          Answer :  Number of maintenance personnel and major items of hardware.

               Eastern U. S.         36 field engineers     356 nodes
               Central U. S.         29 field engineers     250 nodes
               Western U. S.         29 field engineers     407 nodes
               Europe                 5 field engineers      30 nodes

          See pages 12 and 13 to Part 5 of the Tymnet response to  the  RFP  for
          the number of personnel at third-party locations.


          4.  Question :  Contractual Obligations -  What  type  of  contractual
          agreements are available:

               -  9 A.M. to 5 P.M.
               -  Extended 
               -  24 Hours, on/off site
               -  Special / other

          Answer  :   The  following  maintenance  options  are   available   on
          installations within the Continental U. S.  by Tymnet's Communications
          Maintenance Group.   Similar  coverage  is  offered  in  international
          locations.

               Option B1 - Service provided for eight consecutive working  hours
               (exclusive  of  one  hour intervening meal period) Monday through
               Friday, Tymnet holidays excepted, between  0800  and  1800  local
               time.

               Option B2 - Service  0800  -  2400  local  time,  Monday  through
               Friday, Tymnet holidays excepted.

               Option B3 - Service provided  24  hours  a  day,  Monday  through
               Friday, Tymnet holidays excepted.

               Option B4 - Service provided  24  hours  a  day,  Monday  through
               Sunday.

          Special maintenance requirements for CITIBANK can be negotiated.

          In Europe, maintenance is provided by TNSC, a subsidiary of  Tymshare,
          Inc.    All   other  locations  outside  the  Continental  U. S.   are
          maintained through third party agreements.  At CITIBANK proposed sites
          which  are  not  presently  covered  by  such  agreements, Tymnet will
          establish agreements as needed.  In all cases, pricing  is  determined
          on  a  per  site  basis in accordance with CITIBANK's requirements for
          time and parts availability.
                                                                         Page 12


          5.  Question :  Hardware Delivery Policy - What is your present policy
          for hardware delivery:

               -  Local, whereby you will assure responsibility for 
                  export/import, customs, etc.
               -  PTT, resulting in CITIBANK assuming responsibility 
                  for import and customs.
               -  Other, please specify.

          Answer  :   In  general  it  is  preferable   that   CITIBANK   assume
          responsibility for import/export and customs.


          6.  Question :  Repair Procedure 

          When a node or network  component  requires  repair,  where  will  the
          repair delivery point be:

               -  Locally, within the immediate area.
               -  Internationally, where by the component is shipped to
                  the US
               -  Other, please specify

          Answer :  It is Tymnet's normal policy to  replace  a  defective  part
          from  a  pool  of  locally  available parts.  Defective parts are then
          returned to a central repair depot for repair and return to the  parts
          pool.   This  applies regardless of whether the location is within the
          U. S.  or  an  international  location.   If  a  repair  part  is  not
          available  locally,  new  parts  will  be  air-shipped to the location
          requiring the part.


          7.  Question :  Warranties 

          What are the hardware warranty commitments:

               By category:
               -  On-site
               -  Off-site
               -  Other, please specify

          Answer:  Warranty and Maintenance:

          Warranty:

          TYMNET warrants the equipment purchased hereunder against  faulty
          workmanship  or  the  use  of defective materials for a period of
          ninety (90) days from the date of acceptance of the equipment  by
          Customer.  The liability of TYMNET under this warranty is limited
          to replacing, repairing, or issuing credit (at  TYMNET's  option)
          for  any  items of equipment which are determined to be defective
          during such period, provided that (i) TYMNET is promptly notified
          in  writing  upon  discovery of any defects by Customer, (ii) the
          defective equipment is repaired or replaced at  the  installation
          site  or returned to TYMNET, and (iii) such defects have not been
          caused by misuse, neglect, repair, alteration  or  accident.   No
          warranty shall apply to any item of equipment which is installed,
          modified, maintained, or repaired (in whole or part)  by  persons
          other than TYMNET.

          Limitations:

          THE WARRANTY SET FORTH IN THE SECTION ABOVE IS  IN  LIEU  OF  ALL
                                                                         Page 13


          OTHER  WARRANTIES, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
          TO ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY  OF  MERCHANTABILITY  OR  FITNESS  FOR  A
          PARTICULAR  PURPOSE.   IN  NO  EVENT SHALL TYMNET BE LIABLE UNDER
          THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL  DAMAGES  WITH
          RESPECT  TO  THE  EQUIPMENT  OR  SERVICES  PURCHASED  OR SUPPLIED
          HEREUNDER.

          Maintenance After Warranty Expiration:

          Maintenance not covered by the warranty set forth in the  section
          above  shall  be  provided  by  TYMNET  at Customer's request and
          expense  pursuant  to   TYMNET's   standard   network   equipment
          maintenance agreements and policies as then in effect.


          8.  Question :  Spare Parts/Stock Piling 

          Please outline:

               -  If the spare parts are locally stock piled.
               -  If the stock piling facility is remote, or 
                  internationally.

          Answer :  Tymnet maintains all spare parts locally at the service
          centers,  including  third-party  maintenance  locations.  If the
          customer so  desires,  a  full  complement  of  repair  could  be
          provided  on-site.   The  cost  of this full complement of repair
          parts is approximately $30,000.00 per machine.


          9.  Question :  Hardware Approvals 

          Is the hardware proposed:

               -  Locally installed
               -  Pending PTT Approval
               -  PTT Approved

          Answer :  The hardware Tymnet has proposed is installed by  local
          resources.   Domestically  over  700  TYMNET  Engines  have  been
          installed.  In addition, TYMNET hardware is used by, and approved
          by, most PTT's .


          10.  Question :  Maintenance Back-Up 

          If for whatever reason the resources dedicated to maintenance are
          unavailable,  is  there  back-up  support,  and  where will it be
          provided from?

          Answer  :   Within  the  Continental  U. S.   backup  support  is
          provided  from  the  second  nearest  maintenance service office.
          Internationally, back-up support is  provides  from  the  nearest
          U. S.  location.


          11.  Question :  Working Agreements 

          What is the present operating/working agreements/experience with:

               -  BTI/BPO
               -  Telcom Singapore
               -  C&W Hong Kong
                                                                         Page 14


               -  C&W Bahrain
               -  AT&T
               -  New York/Local 3

          Answer :  Tymnet maintains contractual agreements with  AT&T  and
          C&W  in  a customer/vendor relationship.  Tymnet, on a continuing
          basis,  interfaces  with  all   PTT's   currently   involved   in
          telecommunications   in   developing  world  wide  teleprocessing
          capabilities.  There is no Tymnet  hardware  presently  connected
          with   BPO,   but  Tymnet  meets  regularly  with  BTI/BPO.   New
          York/Local 3 is responsible for installations in New  York  City.
          The  working relationship between Tymnet and individuals of Local
          3 has been excellent.  


          12.  Question :  Maintenance Flexibility 

          Utilizing your existing/proposed resources, outline the depth  of
          support available, I.E.:

               -  Hardware
               -  Software
               -  Terminals
               -  Modems
               -  MDF
               -  Diagnostic
               -  Other, please specify

          Answer :  

               - Hardware:  Local personnel are trained to the board level.
                 In   addition,   high-level   support  is  available  from
                 corporate resources.  See also Section 3.0 of Appendix A.

               - Software:   Complete  support   is   available   for   all
                 applications.   There are three levels of back-up support,
                 two for supervisor code, leading to the development  group
                 (NTD).   The  first level is the communication consultant,
                 the second level is the Headquarters Technical Group,  and
                 the  third  group is the developer in NTD.  In the case of
                 supervisor code the back-up support is direct to  the  NTD
                 developer.  See also Section 3.0 of Appendix A.

               - Terminals:  Support is provided  by  the  manufacturer  or
                 their designated representative.

               - Modems:  Within the U. S., if modems are provided by  AT&T
                 they  are  repaired  by  AT&T.   If modems are provided by
                 Tymnet they are repaired by Tymnet,  usually  by  swapping
                 boards or the modem.  Internationally, modems are normally
                 repaired by the serving PTT or modem supplier.

               - MDF:   Assuming  this  to  mean   maintenance   diagnostic
                 facility,  such  facility  would normally be maintained by
                 the supplier.

               - Diagnostic:  Tymnet performs diagnostics  for  all  Tymnet
                 supported hardware and software.


          13.  Question :  Maintenance Log 

          An important maintenance tool is  the  on-site  maintenance  log.
                                                                         Page 15


          Please  clarify  if  your maintenance staff will provide a log at
          each site on the network.

          Answer :  Tymnet will provide maintenance logs.


          14.  Question :  Environmental 

          In  order  to   effectively   evaluate   the   site   preparation
          requirement, please provide the following:

               -  Power consumption
               -  Type of HVAC required (forced/floor).
               -  Thermal requirements/heat dissipation
               -  Type of outlets required, standard or twistlock.
               -  If each node requires separate circuits
               -  The start-up power consumption
               -  Is the hardware susceptible to external electromagnetic
                  interference?     Will     the     hardware's     emitted
                  electromagnetic  radiation  interfere  in  any  way  with
                  colocated equipment?
                  If so, will you provide EMI shields?  

          Answer :  A Site Preparation Guide  was  provided  with  Tymnet's
          response  to  the RFP.  This Guide contains most of the requested
          information.  In addition, the following are provided.

               - A raised floor is not required although it is preferred.

               - EMI certification is scheduled for 1983.  To  date  Tymnet
                 has   not  experienced  an  EMI  problem  with  co-located
                 devices.  Disk and tape drives and modems operate in close
                 proximity  to  the Tymnet Engine and no problems have been
                 experienced.


          15.  Question :  Cost -  Overseas  installation  -  provide,  and
          where  indicated,  does  it  include  importation,  customs,  and
          shipping.

          Answer:

          The  following  installation  pricing  is  provided  by  Tymshare
          Network  System Consulting (TNSC), a subsidiary of Tymshare, Inc.

                           QUESTIONS FOR TYMNET


          GENERAL

          1) Question :  Describe Internodal Link Protocol


          Answer :  Each network node  contains  routines  to  perform  the
          function  known  as  the  Node  Code.   The Node Code handles the
          internode protocol, the tearing down  and  building  of  packets,
          modification  of  the  permuter  tables  upon  the command of the
          Supervisor, and the flow control of data across network links.


               A) Internode Protocol

               TYMNET has developed its own internal node-to-node  protocol
               for  intra-net  data  transfers.   The  protocol  is  a full
               duplex, error checking, ACK-with-data design which  is  much
               like X.25 level 2 only highly tuned and more efficient.  The
               protocol is described in detail in supporting documentation.

               Data travels in the form of packets between  network  nodes.
               Each  packet  may  contain  data  for several of the network
               circuits using the link.  Each packet is checksummed with  a
               32  bit  checksum.   When  a  packet is received with a good
               checksum, a corresponding acknowledgement is sent along with
               data  in  the  next  packet  transmitted back over the link.
               This TYMNET technology tends to reduce the overhead of  data
               packets by multiplexing data traveling in the same direction
               into single packets.

               The TYMNET II packet format is indicated  below.   A  packet
               can consist of several logical records relating to different
               users.  The maximum packet size in TYMNET II is  128  bytes.
               The  maximum  logical record size in TYMNET II is 121 bytes.
               Both packets and logical records are variable size.

               The logical records size determination is the same  for  all
               application  types.  Logical records are of variable length,
               the RMAKE procedure (See Appendix F of proposal.) determines
               the  length  of  each logical record by use of the following
               criteria:

                  A) BCT - data count     (from buffer descriptor)
                  B) Packet size         (physical limitation)
                  C) Backpressure        (quantity limitation)

               Incoming blocks such as  2780  or  SDLC  are  enveloped  and
               transported via the TYMNET II protocol.  The incoming blocks
               must be split up to accommodate the maximum  logical  record
               size of 121 bytes plus other protocol limitations.

          A TYMNET II packet arriving at a node has the format:

            (number of bits:)
            4    4   8   8    8       8  variable   8      8  variable  32
          |    |   |   |   |      |       |     |      |       |     |    |
          |BORI|CNT|ACK|REC|Length|Channel|DATA |Length|Channel|DATA |    |
          |    |   |   |   |      |       |     |      |       |     |    |
           ---------------------------------------------------------------
              H E A D E R  \                                       /Check-
                                                                         Page 18


                            \                                     / sum
                                L O G I C A L       R E C O R D S

               B) Buffer and Channel Allocation

               A circuit going into a network node is allocated one logical
               channel on the link it uses to "enter" the node.

               In  TYMNET  II,  the  number  of  channels  is   dynamically
               allocated.   A  channel  is  assigned  to a circuit when the
               circuit is built, and the circuit retains the exclusive  use
               of  that  channel  until  the  circuit  is  torn down.  If a
               circuit passes through a node, it is also assigned a channel
               on  the link it uses to "exit" the node.  Enter and exit are
               misnomers in that the circuit is full duplex.  They are used
               here simply for descriptive purposes.

               Additionally, each circuit in a network node is allocated  a
               pair  of  buffers  when  the  circuit is built.  Each buffer
               handles the data flowing in one direction over the  circuit.
               These buffers are dynamic and require no space when empty.

               In  TYMNET  II,  the  Node  Code  allocates  its   resources
               dynamically.   The  Supervisor  simply  indicates  the nodes
               through which the circuit must pass.

               C) Tearing Down and Building Packets

               When a packet is received with a good checksum, it  is  torn
               down  by  the  Node  Code,  and the data for each circuit is
               placed into the buffer dedicated to that circuit.  Likewise,
               when  a  packet  is  being assembled for transmission over a
               link, data is removed from the buffers which contain data to
               be transmitted across the link.

               A round robin algorithm is used to build records.  That  is,
               once  a  logical  record  is  made for a given channel, that
               channel will not be serviced again until all other  channels
               with data present have been serviced.

               Channels can be given priority for  data  transfers.   These
               channels  will  receive  (collectively)  up  to  80%  of the
               available bandwidth.  This priority is used in TYMNET II for
               control circuits.

               D) Flow Control

               Flow  control  in  a  TYMNET  network  is  performed  on   a
               per-channel  basis.   Periodically,  each  node examines the
               buffers associated with each input  process.   If  a  buffer
               exceeds  a  threshold,  the  process  is  informed  to  stop
               inputting for that port until further notice.

               For  the  link  control  process,  a  passive  flow  control
               technique  is  used.   Periodically,  each  node informs its
               neighbors on which channel it is permitted to transmit data.
               Each time permission is given, a fixed amount of data (based
               on the throughput class of this circuit) is  allowed  to  be
               transmitted.


          2) Question :  Provide a bid price on Phase V.
                                                                         Page 19


          Answer :  Appendix B provides a budgetary quote for Phase  V  for
          hardware  and  software  only.   Development  effort is needed to
          develop the necessary protocol conversion and to develop the CASE
          DCX850  emulation.   This  development  may,  or  may not, affect
          hardware and software  configuration  and/or  cost.   Development
          costs  cannot  be provided at this time since Tymnet has not been
          provided the data needed to determine the  level  of  development
          effort   needed.    Specifically,   Tymnet  needs  the  following
          information:

               - The synchronous protocol that will interface to the London
                  host, X.25 was assumed for the budgetary quote.

               - What log-on menu facilities are to be provided.

               - The protocol used by the CASE DCX850.


          3) Question :  Provide an implementation schedule for Phases II -
          V.

          Answer  :   Appendix  C  provides  a  tentative  list  of   major
          milestones  for  Phases  I  through  IV.  A firm schedule will be
          developed upon receipt of a contract.  A  schedule  for  Phase  V
          cannot  be  provided at this time since the total requirement for
          this phase are not  fully  understood.   See  the  answer  to  2)
          preceeding.


          4) Question :  Answer questions in section G.9 of RFP.

          Answer:  G.9.1 - NETWORK CONTROL FACILITIES

          The overall operation of a Tymnet network is greatly  facilitated
          by  various  network  control  features.   These  special network
          control facilities include the following:


          Centrally Controlled Supervisor

          Every Tymnet network is controlled by a software  package  called
          the Supervisor.  The Supervisor is, in turn, centrally controlled
          through an operator console which may be located anywhere on  the
          network.   From  the  operator  console, the network operator has
          access to a variety of information about the network, such as the
          status  of any node (up or down), the status of any host (open or
          shut) and network load and traffic conditions.

          The Supervisor resides in a job slot in one of the network nodes.
          A  back-up Supervisor resides in a different node.  (There may be
          multiple back-up Supervisors  in  larger  networks;   the  Tymnet
          public network has three back-ups.) This structure is illustrated
          in Figure 1 on the following page.

          The Supervisor's primary responsibility is to route data  traffic
          in  an  efficient  manner.   As  the routing begins at login, the
          Supervisor controls all logins  to  the  network.   When  a  user
          initiates  a  login, the Supervisor receives a message indicating
          that the user wishes to connect to the network.   The  Supervisor
          assumes  control  of  the  login  at  that  point, and begins the
          process of establishing a virtual circuit for  the  user  to  his
          destination.    The   Supervisor  creates  the  path  by  sending
          appropriate information to each node along  the  selected  route.
                                                                         Page 20


          If  a  path is interrupted after it is established, the user logs
          in again, and the Supervisor establishes a new  path,  using  the
          most current information it has regarding the status of the nodes
          and  lines  in  the  network.    This   rerouting   will   happen
          automatically  (that  is, without a new login) in networks having
          the  new  automatic  rerouting  feature  of  the  the  Tymnet  II
          technology.

          In the  event  of  a  failure  of  the  Supervisor,  the  back-up
          Supervisor  takes  control  of  the  network  automatically.  The
          take-over process happens in the following manner:   as  part  of
          its  normal  operation, the primary Supervisor sends a continuous
          series of messages to the back-up Supervisor  which  indicate  to
          the back-up that its services are not needed.  These messages are
          known as "sleeping pills." If the Supervisor fails, the "sleeping
          pill" is not received by the back-up Supervisor;  this causes the
          back-up Supervisor to "wake up", and begin to assume  control  of
          the network.  It assumes control by establishing contact with the
          node nearest to it, and determining the connections to that node.
          It   then   branches  out,  interrogating  each  node  about  the
          connections to it until it has a complete view of the topology of
          the  network.   In the public network, the process of taking over
          the 900 nodes takes a few minutes;  in  a  private  network,  the
          length  of time will depend on the size of the network, but it is
          generally a matter of seconds.

          Established circuits are not necessarily interrupted  during  the
          failure  of  a  Supervisor  and  the takeover of the network by a
          back-up Supervisor.  Normally, the only disruption in service  is
          the  inability of the network to process new logins until the new
          Supervisor has taken over all nodes required  to  create  a  path
          from a given origin to a given destination.


          Network Control Software Packages

          Figure 2 depicts a typical Network  Control  Engine  -  the  node
          where the network Supervisor resides.  Some of the other software
          components that may  occupy  this  node  include  the  following.
          NOTE:   all  network control software packages cannot reside in a
          single node.


                 ISIS Kernel.

                 The Kernel serves as the operating system of the node  and
                 controls the remaining software components in the Engine.


                 Node Code.

                 This is the software that handles internode communications
                 and packeting of data.

                 RAM.

                 The name is an acronym for Raw  Accounting  Merger.   This
                 software  product  handles  accounting data collection and
                 reporting for each user session.  The data it gathers from
                 the  Supervisor's  on-line  disk  for each session include
                 information such as the number of characters  transmitted,
                 the  speed of the terminal, the host to which the terminal
                 is connected, and the particular application of  the  host
                                                                         Page 21


                 which  is being utilized.  The accounting records from all
                 Supervisors which have been up during a session (including
                 back-up  Supervisors)  are  merged, and the information is
                 consolidated on a single magnetic tape.  The tape  can  be
                 run  off-line  in  a  customer's  own  computer  system to
                 generate accurate billing for network use.


                 VAL.

                 This is a user validation facility which provides  network
                 access  control.   VAL  can enforce restrictions regarding
                 user origin, and can limit user access to designated hosts
                 and  nodes.   Some  aspects  of network access control are
                 achieved  by  means  of   network   passwords;    VAL   is
                 responsible  for  verifying  passwords  and for processing
                 password changes.


                 ELF.

                 Eclectic Load Facility is a software package that provides
                 automatic  loading  of software into a node.  If an Engine
                 failure  demands  that  software  be  reloaded,  ELF  will
                 down-line  load it automatically.  (The reloading can also
                 be initiated  by  a  command  from  the  network  operator
                 console.)  Tymnet  networks  are  designed  to  avoid  the
                 necessity of software reloading following certain types of
                 failures.   For example, a short power loss will not cause
                 a  loss  of  software,  as  memory  is  either   core   or
                 semi-conductor  with a battery back-up.  In addition, even
                 if one software component in an Engine fails, the software
                 in  the  other  partitions  will  continue  to run, as the
                 partitions are protected by the hardware memory protection
                 feature of the Engine.


                 PROBE.

                 PROBE is the network access and control program which runs
                 on   the  active  network  Supervisor.   It  interactively
                 monitors all conditions existing in a  Tymnet  network  as
                 they occur.  PROBE allows an approved set of users to have
                 manual inquiry and intervention capabilities at any  time.
                 The functions performed by PROBE include the following:

                      - determine network usage
                      - determine node status, host status and line status
                      - prevent new use of poor quality communications
                      lines and route
                        new circuits over alternate paths


                 PROBE shares common memory  with  the  Supervisor  and  is
                 constantly  in a position to access the Supervisor without
                 depending on  any  external  communications  links.   This
                 gives PROBE a secure position in the network from which to
                 solve problems.

                 Because  PROBE  is  such  a  powerful  tool  for   network
                 operation  center and maintenance personnel, access to the
                 program is restricted by several classes of user status.
                                                                         Page 22


                 TMCS.

                 The Tymnet Monitoring and Control System,  also  known  as
                 NET  PATROL,  is  an  interactive  system  which  provides
                 multiple users with selective access information regarding
                 the  status  of  a  Tymnet  network.   This  access may be
                 limited to a specific subset of the network, and a  subset
                 of  the  network events.  Both the current status, as well
                 as the status at a particular time in  the  past,  may  be
                 displayed.    TMCS  also  provides  access  to  PROBE  for
                 controlling  the  network,  subject  to  a  user's  access
                 profile  and license.  In addition, the system maintains a
                 list of nodes, hosts and lines  not  in  a  normal  state;
                 this  list is known as an exception display.  TMCS runs on
                 an Engine and does not require Supervisor  resources.   It
                 automatically   tracks  the  active  Supervisor  during  a
                 Supervisor change, so that the user does not have  to  log
                 in to a newly activated Supervisor again.

                 TMCS may be used to monitor three aspects of the status of
                 the  network.  First, the user may log directly into PROBE
                 through TMCS to monitor the current status of the network.
                 Second,  the  user  may get a comprehensive listing of all
                 Supervisor log messages to trace the recent history of the
                 status of the network.  Lastly, the user may get a display
                 of current network exceptions such as the nodes, hosts  or
                 lines that are down, shut or missing.


          NETWORK CONTROL CENTER

          The operation of a network  is  overseen  by  a  special  Network
          Control  Facility  staff.   The function of Network Control is to
          monitor the condition of  the  network  and  to  dispatch  system
          resources  to  solve  problems.   Network  Control  consoles  can
          display color-coded network status information.  In the event  of
          a  node failure, the operator can, by a series of commands at his
          terminal, try to ascertain the reason for  the  failure  and  can
          attempt  to  reload  the software.  If he is unsuccessful, he can
          dispatch maintenance people to repair  the  Engine  on-site.   If
          there  is  a  problem with a phone line, the network operator can
          contact the phone repair service.


          G.9.2 - Network nodes are loaded through the use of ELF (Electric
          Loading  Facility).   ELF  is  software  that  is  resident in an
          Engine, that is accompanied by at least one dedicated disk drive.
          The  ELF  software permits 1-6 simultaneous users to initiate the
          downline loading of any node in the network.  This loading can be
          initiated by any terminal on the network, by any operator who has
          the appropriate  username/password  combination.   Alternatively,
          network  nodes  may  be  downline  loaded using a loading program
          called LOAD II.  LOAD II runs on a Tymnet host computer connected
          to  the  Tymnet  public network.  Authorized users may access the
          LOAD II program and downline load or upline dump  network  nodes.
          LOAD II can perform its functions through a gateway.


          G.9.3 - The following statistical information is collected by the
          Raw  Accounting Merger (RAM) for each session established through
          a Tymnet network:  Not all fields enumerated  are  reported  from
          all interfaces.  If reported, they they are collected by RAM.

          see the "RAM User's Guide".


          G.9.4 - The Supervisor  collects  several  types  of  performance
          information  through  PROBE  and  TMCS.   Among  the  information
          collected is the following:  

               - Communication  line error rates (number of
                 retransmissions)
               - Communications lines out of channels (capacity)
               - Node failure - such as power failure
               - Communication lines inoperative (unable to pass
                 data correctly)
               - Login rate
               - Host conditions
               - Determination of where host users have originated a call,
                 and which nodes they pass through en route.

          These and many other reports are  generated  by  the  Supervisor,
          PROBE,  and  the  Supervisor utilities on a real time basis.  For
          more information  on  performance  measurements,  see  the  PROBE
          User's Guide and the TMCS User's Guide.
                                                                         Page 24


          G.9.5 - Supervisor utilities continuously report error conditions
          that  exist  within  the  network.   These  errors  are typically
          reported to a hard-copy terminal, or a CRT.  


          G.9.6,G.9.7 - All diagnostic and inquiry commands reside in PROBE
          and/or  TMCS,  and the Supervisor utilities.  For a comprehensive
          list of these commands, and  their  definitions,  see  the  PROBE
          User's Guide and the TMCS User's Guide.


          G.9.8  -  The  statistical  information  collected  by  the   Raw
          Accounting  and  Merger  (RAM)  provided  in  response to Section
          G.9.3.


          G.9.9 - Tymnet is a centrally controlled  network  and  does  not
          store   accounting  or  statistical  information  in  each  node.
          Accounting information is captured, buffered  briefly,  and  then
          forwarded  to the Supervisor.  At the Supervisor, accounting data
          is either stored on one of the Supervisor's disks,  or  processed
          by the RAM program.

          In addition to sending accounting information,  each  node  sends
          messages to the Supervisor concerning events at that node.  These
          messages are written to a circular file.  Messages  include  such
          things  as  duplicate hosts in the network, node takeover errors,
          host down, link  down,  link  retransmission  errors,  MUD  error
          found, etc.

          The modules that send messages to the Supervisor, as well as  the
          messages  themselves,  are described in Section 8.0 of the Tymnet
          II Principles of Operation manual (Appendix  F  to  the  original
          response  to  CITIBANK)  and  Supervisor  to  node  messages  are
          described in Section 11.3.4  of  the  same  manual.   Information
          concerning  the  collection  of  accounting  data is described in
          Section 1.0 of the RAM User's Guide (Appendix J to  the  original
          response),   and   in  Section  3.2.2.H  of  the  Tymnet  Network
          Specification (Appendix B to the original response to CITIBANK).


          G.9.10 - Trouble reports are not processed by the  nodes  or  the
          NMC.  Section 4.0 of Appendix A discusses the recommended trouble
          reporting system.


          G.9.11,G.9.12 - TMCS is a tool that permits authorized persons to
          receive  both  real time, and historical, network status reports.
          For more information concerning  these  features,  see  the  TMCS
          User's Guide.  


          G.9.13 - See the response to Section G.9.1.


          G.9.14 - See Section 2.3.5 of Appendix A.


          G.9.15 - Tymnet does not maintain a  global  network  picture  in
          each  node.   Tymnet  is  a  centrally  controlled  network.  The
          network supervisor maintains the total picture.  The net topology
          is updated automatically when a node is added.  
                                                                         Page 25


          G.9.16  -  Node  shutdown  is  not  required   for   "data   base
          housekeeping chores".


          G.9.17 - When a slot in  an  Engine  (or  Mini-Engine)  is  being
          reloaded,  only  those  interfaces  associated with that slot are
          inoperative.  All other slots continue to function normally.  The
          exception  to  this  is  the Node Code slot.  If the code in this
          slot is being changed the entire node is inoperative  during  the
          time the slot is being reloaded.


          G.9.18 - The languages that are used in the  development  of  the
          network  software are an assembly language peculiar to the Tymnet
          engine and PASCAL.


          G.9.19 - Users are validated through the User Validation  Program
          (VAL).   Any authorized individual posessing the correct username
          and password may log into VAL  and  validate  a  new  user.   VAL
          writes  the new user name and password, the password in encrypted
          format, to the controlling User Directory (CUD).  VAL then copies
          the  CUD  to  the Master User Directory (MUD) on all supervisors.
          VAL access the disc used by the supervisor.  In addition, a  tape
          drive can be used to back-up the CUD on tape.


          G.9.20 - Tymnet utilizes several  programs  that  operate  in  an
          "off-line"  manner.   Such programs include RAM and ELF.  Each of
          these programs  utilize  peripheral  equipment.   For  a  further
          description of these programs, see the response to G.9.1.


          G.9.21 - In the past  all  report-generation  software  has  been
          developed by the customer.  


          G.9.22 - There are  several  test  tools  available  for  use  by
          private network customers:

                 Hardware Tools.

                 The Tymnet Engine has, as an integrated tool,  a  powerful
                 front  panel.   This  front  panel  drives Engine resident
                 software which is capable of exercising the hardware.   In
                 addition to this, Tymnet has down-line loadable diagnostic
                 software  that  is  loaded  into  an  Engine  when   first
                 deployed.

                 Software Tools.

                 With regard to the testing of  software  products,  Tymnet
                 offers  the  service  of  duplicating  code that exists in
                 private networks in Tymnet's own  lab  engines.   In  this
                 way,   software   can   be   observed   and  tested  in  a
                 non-production environment without affecting the operation
                 of  the  network.   It  should  be noted however, that all
                 software deployed by  Tymnet  to  a  private  network  has
                 previously  undergone extensive testing during the staging
                 process.


          5) Question :  What is  your  maximum  packet  size  and  logical
                                                                         Page 26


          record size?  Is this the same for all traffic/application types?
          For 3270 and 2780, do you split incoming blocks?  If so, what  is
          the size?

          Answer :  See discussion in Internodal Protocol.


          6.  Question:  How large are your Hunt  Groups?   How  many  hunt
          groups  can  you  support  per  node?   Can  synchronous ports be
          supported?

          Answer:  Tymnet assumes "Hunt Group" is used with regard to  Host
          interfaces.  Network host numbers and subhost process identifiers
          may be associated with a particular username such  that  a  "Host
          port   rotor"   effect  may  be  achieved.   A  username  may  be
          multi-targeted to a number of host addresses.  Under  Tymnet  II,
          asynchronous host interfaces allow up to 128 hosts, and up to 128
          subhosts may be specified for  each  network  host  number.   The
          number  of  subhost  process  identifiers may be greater than the
          total number of ports.


          REFERENCE PROPOSAL:

          1.  Question:  How can you support X.3 and X.29 but not X.28?

          Answer:  The X.28 PAD function  is  provided  with  a  TYMSAT  in
          Tymnet  tchnology.   The  TYMSAT  is,  for  most  capabilities, a
          functional superset of the X.28 capabilities.  In particular, the
          TYMSAT is much more user-friendly.  Tymnet will provide a version
          of the TYMSAT witin six months which also  includes  the  literal
          X.28 PAD capability.


          F.1.16.7.12 Network Recovery Resynchronization

          At the time a node goes down, all messages are  purged  from  the
          system.   The  node  will  resume operation in less than 1 minute
          from the time it has been restored.  Should the  Circuit  Rebuild
          feature of Tymnet II be enabled, then following a transit node or
          link outage, Rebuild will reconstruct a new circuit  path  around
          the outage, with no loss of data.

                           CITIBANK SUPPORT PLAN




          1.0 GENERAL

          Tymnet  is  committed  to  providing  full-service   support   to
          CITIBANK.   This  support will be provided for all five phases of
          the WIN network.  As CITIBANK becomes self-sufficient in  certain
          areas,  support  in  those  areas will be phased out at CITIBANKs
          request.  Of necessity,  the  number,  names,  and  locations  of
          Tymnet  personnel  involved  will  vary  with the level of effort
          needed to support CITIBANK.


          2.0 FUNCTIONS

          There are many functions needed to plan,  stage,  install,  test,
          and  support a private network such as CITIBANK.  These functions
          fall into three general areas:  control,  hardware  support,  and
          software support.  Each is discussed in greater detail below.

          2.1 CONTROL FUNCTIONS

          2.1.1 NETWORK ANALYSIS AND DESIGN

          This  function  incorporates  those  tasks  needed  to  initially
          configure  a  network  to  meet  the  operational requirements of
          CITIBANK.  One task is to configure each TYMNET Engine to meet  a
          specific   requirement  of  CITIBANK.   Several  Engines  may  be
          co-located  in  a  cluster  in  order  to  meet  the  total  data
          communication requirements of a given location.  The second task,
          performed  in  parallel  with  the  first,  is  to   design   the
          communication  line  layout  to  handle  the  traffic  loads  and
          patterns projected by CITIBANK.  

          As part of this function, traffic from  the  operational  network
          will  be analyzed to determine patterns and obtain data to be fed
          into design tools.   These  patterns  and  data  will  assist  in
          determining if changes in the network are needed.  See Figure 1.

                            NETWORK DESIGN FLOW

                                 FIGURE 1
          APPENDIX A                                                      Page 4


          2.1.2 CONFIGURATION CONTROL

          Once the network design, including engine configuration, has been
          agreed  to by both CITIBANK and Tymnet personnel, the design will
          be frozen.  Changes to the network must be submitted in  writing,
          by  the party requesting or recommending the change and agreed to
          in writing, by the other  party  before  being  implemented.   An
          on-line  file  will  be  maintained  that consists of the initial
          approved network configuration, all requested changes, action  on
          the changes, and the current network configuration.

          2.1.3 NODE/HOST ASSIGNMENT CONTROL

          Node numbers and host numbers  will  be  assigned  based  upon  a
          mutually  agreed  upon  assignment  scheme.   A data base will be
          maintained that links assigned node numbers to host  numbers  and
          host functions.

          2.1.4 CODE VERSION/RELEASE CONTROL

          The network will initially  be  installed  and  tested  with  the
          latest  release  of  code.   As new versions are released, Tymnet
          will inform CITIBANK, in writing, of the new release and describe
          the  features  of  the  new  release.  CITIBANK has the option of
          accepting the new  release  or  continuing  to  use  the  current
          version  of  the  code.   Code  versions  will be supported for a
          maximum of nine months from the date of  release.   In  order  to
          ensure  uniformity  throughout  the  network, the same version of
          code should be running in all locations.  This does not  preclude
          the  use of new code in one or two locations in order to test new
          releases prior to general deployment.

          2.1.5 PROBLEM RESOLUTION CONTROL

          All problems and questions will  be  referred  to  one  location.
          Referral  must  be  in  writing,  via  ONTYME-II.   In  addition,
          telephone  calls  are  encouraged.   All  trouble   reports   and
          questions  will  be  entered  into  a  data  base.  The status of
          troubles and questions will be updated weekly until resolved.   A
          weekly  report will be generated that lists all open troubles and
          questions along with their current status.  Special  reports  can
          be generated as required and as agreed to by Tymnet and CITIBANK.

          2.1.6 DOCUMENTATION CONTROL

          At the time the contract is signed, CITIBANK will  be  given  one
          copy   of  all  documentation  for  the  TYMNET  Engine  software
          products.  Updates will  be  mailed  to  CITIBANK  upon  release.
          Additional copies may be ordered.
          APPENDIX A                                                      Page 5


          2.1.7 USER VALIDATION CONTROL

          CITIBANK is responsible for all user  validations.   Tymnet  will
          furnish  CITIBANK  a  list  of  Tymnet  personnel  who need to be
          validated to use the WIN network.  The reason(s)  for  validating
          this individual and the host number(s) will also be provided.  As
          needed, changes to this list will be requested.

          2.1.8 DIRECTORY CONTROL

          Tymnet will establish an OnTyme account to be  used  by  CITIBANK
          and  Tymnet personnel in exchanging information regarding the WIN
          network.   Two  user  names  will  be  validated   for   CITIBANK
          personnel.   In  addition,  Tymnet will establish a directory for
          CITIBANK to use in loading code from Tymshare hosts.

          2.1.9 NETWORK MONITORING

          In general CITIBANK is responsible for monitoring and controlling
          the  WIN  network.   Tymnet  must  have  access  to  all  network
          monitoring and control features in order to provide the requisite
          support services when the network is initially installed.  Tymnet
          will perform all control functions until such time as the network
          is  accepted  by  CITIBANK.   During  this time, Tymnet will also
          monitor the network  on  a  continuous  basis.   This  continuous
          monitoring  does  not  relieve CITIBANK of the responsibility for
          monitoring the network and for  reporting  problems.   It  is  an
          adjunct  that  will  be used to aid Tymnet in correcting problems
          and as a backup  to  CITIBANK's  monitoring  of  the  network  as
          CITIBANK  seeks  to  become  familiar with the network monitoring
          functions.  Once the network has been accepted  by  CITIBANK  the
          control function will be turned over to CITIBANK.

          2.2 HARDWARE SUPPORT FUNCTIONS

          2.2.1 SITE SURVEY

          The Tymnet sales representative  will  provide  Site  Preparation
          Guides  for  all  sites.   These  will  be completed, returned by
          CITIBANK,  and  forwarded  to  the  responsible  field   engineer
          district  manager.  Prior to installing hardware, a Tymnet senior
          field engineer, or a field engineering manager  will  visit  each
          site in order to ascertain suitability for installation of TYMNET
          hardware.  A written report, prepared by  the  responsible  field
          engineering manager, will be forwarded to CITIBANK.

          2.2.2 PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE

          As part of Tymnet's maintenance procedures, TYMNET hardware  will
          receive  preventative  maintenance semi-annually, except for disk
          and tape  drives  which  will  receive  preventative  maintenance
          quarterly.   A  written  record  of  all preventative maintenance
          actions will be provided to CITIBANK.

          2.2.3 FIELD CHANGE ORDER (FCO) CONTROL

          Tymnet will ensure that, upon  delivery,  all  hardware  has  the
          latest FCO levels.  Thereafter, emergency FCO's will be installed
          as soon as possible.  Routine FCO's will be installed at the next
          scheduled  preventative maintenance.  FCO revision levels will be
          verified as part of the preventative maintenance services.

          2.2.4 HARDWARE STAGING
          APPENDIX A                                                      Page 6


          All  hardware  will  be  operated  one  week  in   a   laboratory
          environment prior to shipping or undergoing software staging.  It
          is recommended that all  hardware  undergo  a  one  week  burn-in
          period  on-site  after shipping and before users are connected to
          the hardware.  During this one week burn-in period,  actual  code
          will  run in the hardware.  Limited user testing may be conducted
          by CITIBANK during this period.

          2.2.5 HARDWARE INSTALLATION

          Tymnet field engineers, or other designated representatives, will
          install all hardware on-site.

          2.2.6 PROBLEM DETECTION/CORRECTION

          Tymnet will provide personnel to correct  hardware  malfunctions.
          See  4.0  following  for  more  details  on trouble reporting and
          resolution.

          2.3 SOFTWARE SUPPORT

          2.3.1 SOFTWARE CHANGE REQUESTS

          Until such time as CITIBANK becomes self-sufficient, Tymnet  will
          provide  the  personnel  to  process software change requests and
          make the code available for CITIBANK personnel to load.  Requests
          for software changes will be submitted, in writing, to Tymnet via
          OnTyme.  Software change requests will be tracked as described in
          4.0  following Routine software change requests will be performed
          within five working days.   Emergency  software  change  requests
          will be performed as soon as possible.

          2.3.2 REQUIREMENT DETERMINATION

          Prior to generating code, Tymnet personnel will  coordinate  with
          CITIBANK  in  order  to  determine  the  values  for all variable
          parameters.  Wherever possible,  a  list  of  standard  parameter
          settings will be established for subsequent use.
          APPENDIX A                                                      Page 7


          2.3.3 SOFTWARE STAGING

          The supervisors, and such other nodes  as  considered  necessary,
          will be software staged after completion of hardware staging.  In
          this process, the software that will run in the network  will  be
          loaded  into  the  hardware  and,  to  the  extent  possible, all
          functions of the network will be tested.  After shipment,  it  is
          recommended  that  all  hardware  and  software  be  exercised on
          CITIBANK premises in order  to  verify  proper  operations.   See
          2.2.4 above.

          2.3.4 CODE GENERATION/INSTALLATION

          Until CITIBANK can become self-sufficient,  Tymnet  will  perform
          all  code  generation.   Once generated, code will be placed in a
          directory  accessible  by  CITIBANK  and  CITIBANK  will  be   so
          notified.   Except  under  emergency situations, all code loading
          will be done by CITIBANK  personnel.   The  following  procedures
          outline software generation and loading procedures.

          2.3.4.1 REPOSITORY FOR ALL MACHINE/SLOT CODE

          The following  directories  on  Tymnet  hosts  will  contain  all
          released network code.

          Directories "WINNET"  and  "WINCODE"  on  two  separate  Tymshare
          PDP-10  systems  will  contain  all  relevant machine/slot files.
          CITIBANK will have access to the WINNET directory.

               (ND, NW, BK)XXXX.BND
               (ND, NW, BK)XXXX.TYM     Kernal/Node Code
               (ND, NW, BK)XXXX.CMD
               (ND, NW, BK)XXXX.NIB

               (ND, NW, BK)XXXX.TYY
               (ND, NW, BK)XXXX.CYY
               (ND, NW, BK)XXXX.NYY     Slot code
               (ND, NW, BK)XXXX.MXX
               (ND, NW, BK)XXXX.LOD
               (ND, NW, BK)XXXX.LXX

          Where:

               ND represents software that has run  in  production  for  72
          hours.  It is a back-up file to the NW file.

               NW represents upgrades to existing a production  code  after
          running  successfully  for  72  hours  NW  code  will  become the
          production code.  (i.e.  ND).
          APPENDIX A                                                      Page 8


               BK represents the back-up for the production software ND.

               XXXX represents the node number.

               YY represents the  slot  number.   2.3.4.2  CODE  GENERATION
          REQUESTS (ROUTINE)

          CITIBANK will submit, a software change requests via ontyme in an
          agreed  upon  format, a minimum of five working days prior to the
          date the code is needed.  Tymnet will compile the code, place  it
          in the WINNET directory and notify CITIBANK via OnTyme.  CITIBANK
          is responsible for loading and testing the code.  Once  the  code
          has  been  tested  for  72  hours,  CITIBANK  is  responsible for
          renaming the files in the WINNET directory and  notifying  Tymnet
          so  that  the files in WINCODE can likewise, be renamed.  Routine
          software change requests will be handled as category 3  problems.
          See 4.2 following.

          2.3.4.3 CODE GENERATION REQUESTS (EMERGENCY)

          Emergency software changes requests will be handled as Category l
          or  Category  2  problems,  see 4.2 and 4.3 following.  Emergency
          software change requests may be made via telephone call, followed
          by  an  OnTyme.   Tymnet  will  respond as described in paragraph
          4.4.1 following.

          2.3.4.4 NETWORK CODE LOADS

          Network code loads fall into three categories:   standard,  test,
          and  emergency.   Whenever any new code is loaded, an OnTyme will
          be sent to an established  distribution  list.   This  list  will
          include,  among  others,  CITIBANK,  the Project Manager, Project
          Coordinator, Software and Hardware Coordinators,  and  the  field
          engineering operation centers.

               Standard - refers to a code load performed as per a schedule
          and does not require unusual assistance.

               Test - refers to  a  scheduled  load  of  field  test  code,
          requiring support and quality assurance monitoring.

               Emergency  -  refers  to  code  generation  and   load   not
          scheduled.  It is an emergency when:

               a.  The machine/slot is down and a code change is required.

               b.  The machine/slot  is  crashing  and  a  code  change  is
               required.

          2.3.4.4.1 STANDARD CODE LOAD

          Standard code loads fall into  two  categories:   production  and
          upgrade.

               Production - refers to a new installation of software  where
          there  is not an existing machine or slot in the network.  Tymnet
          will generate an NDXXXX.--- series of software.   An  NW  and  BK
          file series is not required.

               Upgrade - refers to any change associated with  an  existing
          machine/slot  in the network.  TYMNET will generate an NWXXXX.---
          series of software.  CITIBANK will load from the NWXXXX.--- file.
          When  the  software  has operated for 72 hours CITIBANK will move
          APPENDIX A                                                      Page 9


          the existing NDXXXX.--- series to a BKXXXX.---  series  and  move
          the NWXXXX.--- series to a NDXXXX.--- series.

          2.3.4.4.2 TEST CODE LOAD

          A test code load follows the procedures as outlined in  2.3.4.4.1
          with the following exception:  CITIBANK will designate test sites
          to be loaded.  An OnTyme will be  generated  listing  the  sites.
          CITIBANK will monitor the load and continue to be the contact for
          the test code.  If the machine/slot goes out of the  network  for
          any  reason  other than a scheduled outage, CITIBANK will contact
          Tymnet immediately.

          2.3.4.4.3 EMERGENCY CODE LOAD

          In an emergency code load, it will be the responsibility  of  the
          loader  to  immediately,  via  a RUSH OnTyme, notify CITIBANK and
          Tymnet of the emergency code  load,  the  location  of  the  load
          files,  which files were loaded and any changes that were made to
          the loaded files.  The loader will be responsible  for  the  load
          until  Tymnet has been notified, and all relevant files have been
          renamed into WINNET/WINCODE directories.  If the Engine/slot goes
          down  for any reason other than a scheduled outage, CITIBANK will
          contact  Tymnet.   Once  the   files   are   renamed   into   the
          WINNET/WINCODE  directories,  Tymnet is responsible for notifying
          CITIBANK via an OnTyme  message  and  updating  or  deleting  the
          corrected file.


          2.3.4.5 BACK-UP VERSION OF CODE

          In the event that the current load cannot  be  accomplished,  the
          following back-up scheme will be followed.

               The NDXXXX.--- series will be used as the back-up files  for
          an NWXXXX.--- series load.

               The BKXXXX.--- series will be  the  back-up  files  for  the
          NDXXXX.  series.

               Note:  BK series files will be deleted within 72 hours after
          an upgrade to reduce storage requirements.

          2.3.5 BASELINE

          Tymnet has an established system in place that serves to  control
          software  releases.   This  system  is  called "BASELINE".  Every
          three months (January 1, April  1,  July  1,  and  October  1)  a
          document  is  published  that lists the current versions of code.
          Software support  is  provided  for  the  current  plus  the  two
          previous  baseline  releases.   If,  before  the next baseline is
          released, a code version is upgraded to  add  new  features,  the
          code is released as an 'Epsilon' release.  CITIBANK will have the
          option of upgrading to the newest releases or continuing  to  run
          the  existing  version  of  code.   Tymnet  will  coordinate with
          CITIBANK to ensure that all  foreseeable  impacts  regarding  new
          code  are considered before a decision to upgrade to the Baseline
          version is made.   The  current  release  and  the  two  previous
          releases  of  Baseline  code  will be supported.  If problems are
          found in unsupported releases,  code  must  be  upgraded  to  the
          current release before the problem can be investigated.

          2.3.6 PROBLEM DETECTION/CORRECTION
          APPENDIX A                                                     Page 10


          Tymnet will provide personnel to correct  software  malfunctions.
          See  4.0  following  for  more  details  on trouble reporting and
          resolution.

          3.0 TYMNET SUPPORT ORGANIZATION

          3.1 GENERAL

          The organization shown in Figure 2 depicts graphically the  field
          organization  that Tymnet proposes to support CITIBANK.  Specific
          duties are discussed in the following paragraphs.  In addition to
          those   individuals  shown  in  Figure  2,  other  resources  are
          available that will be called upon as required.  These  resources
          are shown in Figure 3 and are also discussed below.

          3.2 PROJECT MANAGER

          The Tymnet Project Staff will work under  the  direction  of  the
          Tymnet  Project  Manager.   This  individual  will  have  overall
          responsibility for the project and will be  accountable  for  its
          success.  Project responsibilities will be delegated as necessary
          to achieve and  maintain  an  operational  network  system.   The
          Project  Manager will be the primary interface between Tymnet and
          CITIBANK.   Counseling  to  CITIBANK  personnel  on   significant

          APPENDIX A                                                     Page 13


          3.5 SOFTWARE COORDINATOR

          This  person  will  be  an  experienced   Tymnet   Communications
          Consultant  and will have responsibility for all software matters
          including code generation,  problem  resolution,  etc.   He  will

          project  staff.   This  person  will  have responsibility for all
          functions listed in 2.3 above.

          3.6 COMMUNICATIONS CONSULTANTS

          These will be several individuals, each of whom is  assigned  one
          or  more  interfaces to support.  They will be selected for their
          knowledge and expertise on the assigned interfaces.

          3.7 HARDWARE COORDINATOR

          This individual will be a field engineering District Manager  and
          will  have  responsibility  for  all  hardware  matters including
          installation and  problem  resolution.   He  will  supervise  the
          activities  of  the  field  engineers  and  will coordinate their
          activities with other members of the project staff.  This  person
          will have responsibility for all functions listed in 2.2 above.

          3.8 FIELD ENGINEERS

          These will be several people  geographically  located  so  as  to
          provide  support  to  the  installed hardware.  These individuals
          will  be  responsible  for  all   preventative   and   corrective
          maintenance  on  installed equipment.  See Section 5.2 for a list
          of geographical support centers for CITIBANK.

          3.9 TYMNET NETWORK SUPPORT AND OPERATIONS DIVISION

          This division provides both  software  and  hardware  support  to
          assist  the  field  Project  Team, see paragraphs 3.2 through 3.8
          above.

          3.9.1 SOFTWARE SUPPORT

          Software support is provided by a group that consists of  product
          specialists.  Problems that cannot be resolved in a timely manner
          by field communications consultants are referred to  the  product
          specialist  who has extensive knowledge and expertise in specific
          protocols such as 3270 and  the  TYMNET  implementation  of  that
          protocol.  With more specialized knowledge the product specialist
          can assist the field communication consultant in determining  the
          cause  of the problem.  Due to the nature of the TYMNET software,
          this assistance is normally provided remotely.  Once the  problem
          has  been  ascertained  the  normal  procedure  is  to generate a
          'patch' that is assembled into the code to correct  the  problem.
          Patches  are  forwarded  to  the Network Technology division, see
          3.10 following, for subsequent incorporation in a  later  version
          of  code.   The product specialist can call on NTD for assistance
          in resolving problems if needed.

          3.9.2 HARDWARE SUPPORT

          Hardware support  takes  the  form  of  providing  assistance  in
          resolving  technical  questions  beyond  the  scope  of the field
          maintenance organization, expediting delivery of urgently  needed
          repair  parts,  and providing the documentation needed to perform
          APPENDIX A                                                     Page 14


          hardware maintenance.

          3.10 NETWORK TECHNOLOGY DIVISION

          Essential functions performed by this division are listed below:

               *  Hardware manufacture.

               *  Development of new products, both hardware and software.

               *  Revision to existing software products.

               *  Resolution  of  problems  for  products   not   currently
          supported by the Tymnet Network Support and Operations Division.

               *  Hardware and software staging.

          4.0 PROBLEM REPORTING, RESOLUTION, AND ESCALATION

          4.1 GENERAL

          CITIBANK will report all  problems  to  Tymnet  via  OnTyme.   In
          addition,  questions  and  software  change  requests  are  to be
          submitted via OnTyme.  Telephone reporting is encouraged in order
          to  expedite  matters  and  is  to  be used in the event that the
          OnTyme system  cannot  be  accessed.   If  a  trouble  report  is
          initially  submitted  via  telephone,  then  a trouble report via
          Ontyme should be submitted  as  soon  as  possible.   A  mutually
          agreed  to  format  will  be  used  to  report  problems,  answer
          questions, and request  software  changes.   Tymnet  will  report
          changes  in  status  as  changes occur and will generate a weekly
          report  that  lists  all  outstanding  problems,  questions,  and
          software change requests along with the current status.  When the
          problem is resolved, the resolution will be reported to CITIBANK.
          Changes  in  status,  the weekly open trouble report, and problem
          resolution will be promulgated via OnTyme.

          4.2 PROBLEM CATEGORIES

          In general, there are three categories  of  problems,  questions,
          and software change requests:

               a.  Category 1:  A machine or slot is out of the network, or
          is crashing repeatedly.

               b.  Category 2:  A machine or slot is up in the network  but
          some aspect of performance is degraded.  Degraded performance may
          be that some ports are inoperative, that  a  software  option  is
          causing degraded service and a code change is required, etc.

               c.  Category 3:  This category includes  questions,  routine
          software  change requests, and other matters or problems, such as
          documentation that does not adversely affect users in  the  daily
          use of the network.

          4.3 PROBLEM REPORTING

          Tymnet will maintain a central reporting  center  to  handle  all
          reported  problems.  This center will be manned 24 hours a day, 7
          days a week.  All problems are to be reported to this center  via
          OnTyme  and/or  telephone,  see  4.1  above.   OnTymes  reporting
          Category 1 and Category 2 problems are to be sent using the  RUSH
          option  of  the  SEND command.  These OnTymes will be received in
          APPENDIX A                                                     Page 15


          the center and will be acted  upon  immediately.   During  normal
          working  hours,  the  center  will  refer problems to the Project
          Coordinator/Manager and  to  the  Hardware/Software  Coordinator.
          After working hours, the center will refer Category 1 problems to
          the designated on-call software or  hardware  person.   Once  the
          problem  has  been referred to the Hardware/Software Coordinator,
          that person assumes responsibility for problem  resolution  until
          the  problem  has  been resolved, or changed from a hardware to a
          software (or vice-versa) problem.  Even though a problem may have
          been   escalated,   it   remains   the   responsibility   of  the
          Hardware/Software Coordinator  to  ensure  that  the  problem  is
          resolved  in  a timely fashion.  Problems referred to the on-call
          software/ hardware person are the responsibility of  that  person
          until   resolved,   changed   from   software   to  hardware  (or
          vice-versa), or until the beginning of normal  working  hours  on
          the  next  work  day,  at  this time, the problem will become the
          responsibility of the Hardware/Software Coordinator.

          4.4 PROBLEM RESOLUTION AND ESCALATION

          4.4.1 RESOLUTION GOALS

          The following goals are established for responding  to  problems.
          Times  are from receipt of4 notification of the problem.  Repairs
          will normally be completed within 24 hours of notification.

               a.  Category 1:  Four working hours

               b.  Category 2:  Eight working hours

               c.  Category 3:  Resolution will  normally  be  within  five
          working days.  However, in some instances, such as documentation,
          and enhancements to software, resolution  may  take  longer  than
          five  working  days.   In  these  instances,  an  answer  will be
          provided within five working days as to how the problem  will  be
          resolved.  4.4.2 ESCALATIONS

          4.4.2.1 CATEGORY 1

               a.  Four    hour    escalation:     notify    the    Project
          Manager/Coordinator.

               b.  Eight hour escalation:  notify  Tymnet  Network  Support
          and Operations Division.

          4.4.2.2 CATEGORY 2

               a.  Eight  working  hour  escalation:   notify  the  Project
          Manager/Coordinator.

               b.  Sixteen working hour escalation:  notify Tymnet  Network
          Support and Operations Division.

          4.4.2.3 CATEGORY 3:

          If the matter has not  been  resolved,  or  an  answer  provided,
          within  five  work days, the Project Manager/ Coordinator will be
          notified.

                               CITIWIN IMPLEMENTATION


          The following pages illustrate a proposed implementation schedule
          for   the  CITIWIN  network  Phases  1  through  4.   The  actual
          implementation schedule is negotiable and should  be  defined  at
          the  time of contract signing.  Tymnet invites the opportunity to
          work with CITIBANK to develop a schedule that will be  acceptable
          to all parties involved.

          The implementation schedule for Phase 5 was not included in  this
          document.   Due  to  the  fact  that  this  phase  requires  some
          development,  it  would  not  be  practical  to   schedule   such
          installation  without further evaluation of CITIWIN's requirement
          by Tymnet's Development Group.
