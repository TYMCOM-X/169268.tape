            (ASYNCHRONOUS TERMINAL CONCENTRATOR)  


The TYMNET ATC (Asynchronous Terminal Concentrator) is a compact
communications processor providing terminal users with economical access
to a TYMNET packet switched data network.  The ATC concentrates data
from up to 8 remote or clustered asynchronous terminals and converts it
to TYMNET's synchronous internodal protocol on one network line using
multi-user data packets for efficient transmission.

The ATC is preconfigured with all program and confidence checking routines 
in non-volatile memory.  The self-configuring design of the ATC software
automatically selects operating parameters, eliminating specialized
procedures.  The ATC is designed to operate in typical office environments.


HIGHLIGHTS:

- Self-contained software in non-volatile memory
- Integral hardware self checks
- 8 terminal and 2 network ports
- Port-level session accounting 
- Operational visibility to Network Control Center
- Modem control signals available on all ports
- Automatic baud rate detection on all ports
- ASCII character code
- Compact office environment design

CAPABILITIES:

The ATC supports the following TYMNET value-added network functions:

- Remote asynchronous terminal interfacing
- Asynchronous terminal concentration
- Terminal protocol, speed, and code translation
- Variable length, multi-user data packets
- Virtual circuit network paths

DESCRIPTION:

The ATC is based on a VLSI 16 bit micro-processor.  Supplied complete
in an attractive desk-top mounting cabinet, the ATC contains power supply,
processor, memory and I/O interfaces.  Since the software is provided in
PROM memory, network management and expansion are simplified by eliminating
software downloading for reconfiguration and after power failures.
Installation is also as simple because each port automatically detects
communication speed and character code translation when the terminal
identifier is entered.  A hardware self-test is executed each time power
up occurs, providing operational status using visual indicators on the
front panel.

Two network ports are supplied as standard.  Applications requiring
extra network access reliability may use both network ports to
accomodate alternate network paths in case of line or modem failure.
Operations management software is provided which queries the ATC and its
network and terminal ports for operating status.  Session accounting 
information is available to the port level.

The transmission speeds for asynchronous ports are available from 110 to
9,600 bps and for synchronous network ports from 2,400 to 9,600 bps.
Asynchronous communication lines are supported in full- or half-duplex
mode.  All port signals conform to EIA RS-232C interface standards.

The maximum configuration of an ATC is dependent on the number and speed
of the ports and the device types.
