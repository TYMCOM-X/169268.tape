.SEC(ESCALATION/DEESCALATION PROCEDURES)
.SS(PURPOSE OF PROCEDURES)







The purpose of TECHNICAL SERVICE'S Escalation Procedures is  to provide
the field organization  with 24-hour per  day/7-day per week  access to
software/hardware support resources at headquarters.


Normal business-hour communications with Technical Servies will  be via
OnTyme  and  telephone,  with  off-hours  and  'emergency'  access made
through Network Control (see OFF-HOURS Support procedures, section 7)


This procedure outlines how to escalate a problem to  the headquarter's
technical suport  group.  It  describes the format  and content  of the
formal escalation,  and the method  used to report  status on  all open
escalations.   This  procedure  also  defines  how  de-escalations will
occur.
.SEC(ESCALATION TO HEADQUARTERS SUPPORT GROUPS)

All  software/hardware  problems  that have  existed  within  the
field support organization  for  48  hours,  and  have  not  been 
resolved,  MUST be escalated to Technical Services.


A network problem  is to be escalated  to Technical Services  by Tymnet
field personnel (this  includes a field Communication  Specialist (CS),
RTC, or project manager).


An  OnTyme  "EXEC" program  has  been  created to  prompt  you  for the
required information.  This Exec can be invoked by entering:
.begin box
                       ":EXEC *** FORMS.RFI/ESCAL"
.end

A generic username has been set-up for anyone who does not  have access
to  our Exec  file  through their  OnTyme  host.  Simply  login  to the
following ID:
.begin box
        please log in:  EMSNSS
                   ID?  NSS.ESCALATIONS
                  KEY?  FIELD.ESC
.end
A  problem is  considered 'ESCALATED',  only after  this form  has been
FULLY filled  out, completely  describing the nature  and scope  of the
problem  and  sent  via  OnTyme  to  the  appropriate  persons  in  the
headquarter's  technical  support  group.   [Incomplete  forms  will be
rejected.]


The distribution list, that an escalation will be directed  to, depends
upon the software type involved.   The files listed below will  be used
for  escalation  to  the  individual  responsible  for  supporting that
product, as well  as the appropriate  unit manager.  In  addition, your
ontyme will  be copied to  the appropriate Network  Technology Division
(NTD)  personnel,  responsible  for development,  and  to  the Hardware
Technical Support (HTS) personnel, responsible for hardware.  This will
enable  all three  divisions the  ability to  exchange  information and
problem history tracking between organizations.
.SKIP 1
.begin box
                            DISTRIBUTION FILE NAMES

        *** ALFRED           68K Engine Debugger
        *** CONSAT           ISIS Consats
        *** ISIS             ISIS-68K Operating System

.end

The OnTyme sender sould always  use the ":SEND CC" option, so  that all
receipients can verify that the appropriate people were copied.  If the
originator would like  to include other  individuals in the  routing of
the  OnTyme,  they are  free  to do  so.   It is  recommended  that the
originator, as well as  their manager, account representative,  and the
sales representative for the account, be copied on the escalation also.


If a problem reaches Technical Services, which requires  the assistance
of HTS, then Technical Services will immediately forward the escalation
to the appropriate HTS personnel.
.SKIP 1

The original  Ontyme message  number will  be the  escalation reference
number for further correspondence.  And, again,  whenever corresponding
in  ragards  to  the  escalation,  be  sure  to  use   the  appropriate
distribution file.
.SS(EXCEPTIONS TO FORMAL PROCEDURES CONCERNING "HOT" ESCALATIONS)


 A problem  often requires  a  more timely  response  than  the OnTyme-
required   communication   may   permit.    For    expediency,   verbal
communications are  accepted, but  MUST be  documented by  the "formal"
procedures as outlined.


In  the event  of  an Off-hour  escalation, Technical  Services  can be
accessed through a call  to Network Control, who will  dispatch through
an on-call paging system (to be discussed in section 7).















.SEC(ASSIGNING ESCALATIONS A PRIORITY)


The  priority  of  escalations,  within  Technical  Services,  will  be
established on a first-in/first-out  basis for each of  the established
priority levels.   All escalations  must be  assigned a  priority.  The
priority  will indicate  the severity  of the  problem  being reported.
This  priority  number  is  to  be  assigned  by  the  Field  CS,  with
concurrence of the customer.  This process establishes responsibilities
for  both  parties and  commits  the customer  to  certain  actions and
responsibilities.   This  allows  us  to  focus  on  the  most critical
problems  and manage  the  escalation and  its resolution  in  the most
efficient manner.


                    SOFTWARE/HARDWARE ESCALATION PRIORITIES

.SEC(TECHNICAL SERVICES ESCALATION TO NTD)


With  regard to  problems  escalated to  Technical  Services, Technical
Services will  become the focal  point for all  communication regarding
the  problem  escalation.   Technical  Services  will  also  assume the
function of problem management.   Technical Services may draw  upon the
resources of  (NTD), as  well as  other technical  groups, to  effect a
final solution to a problem escalation.


Problems  submitted to  Technical Services  for resolution  may  not be
solvable  by the  assigned  support person.   This  may be  due  to the
complexity of  the problem,  or to time  constraints.  In  these cases,
Technical  Services  will draw  upon  the resources  of  NTD  for final
resolution.  In all cases,  software problems that have  existed within
Technical Services  for more than  72 hours WILL  BE escalated  to NTD.
Depending on priorities, escalations may be forwarded to NTD as soon as
12 hours.  The  means of escalation will  be an OnTyme message  sent by
Technical Services to the triple-star product file, which  includes the
developer,  the  developer's  manager,  the  Technical  Service's  Unit
Manager,  and the  submittor of  the original  escalation.   The OnTyme
Message  will  contain  all  information  provided  with  the  original
escalation,  as  well  as  any  information  gathered  while  technical
services was working to resolve the problem.

.SEC(TECHNICAL SERVICES ESCALATION TO HTS)
In the event a  software escalation submitted to Technical  Services is
subsequently determined  to invovle a  hardware anomaly,  the following
steps are taken:
.begin box
1.  The HQ Network Consultant must inform the initiator of the 
    escalation, via Ontyme, of the following:

    a.  Escalation number and customer name.
    b.  Findings relating to the escalation.
    c.  Instructions for the CS to contact the local FE to take 
        appropriate action.
    d.  Statement that the escalation is being forwarded to HTS for
        follow-up on the hardware problem.
    The HQ Network Consultant will copy the appropriate
    (***) distribution file, in addition to the field CS.


2.  The HQ Technical Administrator, upon receipt of the above OnTyme, 
    will formally escalate to HTS.  For administrative purposes, the
    priority of the escalation will be reduced to a level '5' during
    the time the escalation is with HTS.  Information to be included 
    will be the following:

    a.  Original escalation number, customer name, and related
        information.
    b.  All subsequent findings of the field and HQ Tech Svc's staff.

    This escalation to HTS should be copied to the appropriate (***)
    file and the field CS, who originated the escalation.

 3.  An acknowledgement via Ontyme will be made by HTS within 24 hours
     to the field CS and the approprite (***) file.  This OnTyme will
     contain the following information:

     a.  escalation number and customer name.
     b.  The name of the HTS person assigned to resolve the escalation.
     c.  The action which will be taken towared resolution.

 4.  HTS will follow-up with OnTymes sent to field CS and appropriate
     (***) file as to the progress/findings/resolution.

.end
NOTE:   THIS  PROEDURE ONLY  APPLIES  WHEN A  "SOFTWARE"  ESCALATION IS
SUBSEQUENTLY DETERMINED, BY TECHNICAL SERVICES, TO INVOVLE A 'HARDWARE'
ANOMALY.  PROBLEMS "KNOWN"  TO BE HARDWARE ANOMALIES,  EXCLUSIVELY, ARE
TO FOLLOW NORMAL 'HARDWARE ESCALATION PROCEDURES'.
