             GENTLEMEN,

I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO HAVE CABINETS SENT TO 7 SITES
THAT WILL BE GETTING T1 LINES FOR THE FIRST PHASE OF
THIS PROJECT BUT DO NOT HAVE CABINETS AVAILABLE FOR
THIS EQUIPMENT. THESE SITES ARE:

        NEWARK          NEW YORK
        CHICAGO         SAN FRANCISCO
        DETROIT         NEWPORT BEACH
        ATLANTA

THE PROBLEM I AM RUNNING INTO IS WITH THE PART NUMBERS
FOR THESE CABINETS. I MET WITH MIKE DOWNEY OF MANUFAC-
TURING AND HE HAD BEEN IN THE PROCESS OF CHANGING PART
NUMBERS. I DESCRIBED THE CABINETS NEEDED AND HE GAVE ME
THE FOLLOWING AS PART NUMBERS: 

        170023          BARE CABINET
        57006-001       FRONT DOOR, BACK DOOR, POWER STRIPS

I GAVE THIS INFO TO DEAN SPEILLER AND WHEN DEAN TRIED
TO PLACE THE ORDER WITH FRANK TROGLIONE FRANK STATED
THESE WERE THE INCORRECT NUMBERS. WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR
IS THE FULL SIZED PERIPHERAL CABINET WITH ADJUSTABLE
RACK MOUNTING. MY SUGGESTION IS TO HAVE FRANK AND MIKE
COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON WHAT PART NUMBERS WILL BE USED
AND THEN HAVE THE EQUIPMENT ORDERED ASAP. I HAVE BEEN
TRYING TO CONTACT FRANK AND WILL BE TRYING AGAIN ON MON-
DAY, 02/10/85. IF ANYONE ELSE CAN HELP GET THIS PROBLEM
RESOLVED PLEASE DO. THANKS.
                            TIM
