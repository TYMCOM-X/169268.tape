HARDWARE:  ENGINE
SUBJECT:  INITIALIZATION OF TYMSAT SLOT UNDER ISIS


MACHINES AFFECTED: ALL 7/32 AND ENGINES RUNNING TYMSAT SLOT UNDER ISIS.

SYMPTOM:       THE PROBLEM HAS OCCURRED IN ISIS CONFIGURATIONS IN
               AUSTRALIA, JAPAN, SWEDEN, AND MOST RECENTLY IN SWITZERLAND
               AS WELL AS IN AN ISIS LAB ENVIRONMENT. THE INDICATIONS ARE
               AFTER LOADING OR RESTARTING THE ISIS CODE, TRANSMIT DATA
               LEADS FOR THE LOW-SPEED PORTS (ASYNCHRONOUS) ARE IN THE
               WRONG STATE. I.E. IN A SPACING STATE INSTEAD OF A
               MARKING STATE.(GREEN LED'S ARE LIT FOR TRANSMIT DATA ON
               MONITOR PANEL). THIS CONDITION DOES NOT NECESSARILLY APPLY
               TO ALL PORTS, BUT IF ANY PORTS INITIALIZE TO THIS
               CONDITION - YOU GOT THE BUG. ONLY DATA TERMINAL READY (DTR)
               SHOULD BE ACTIVE AFTER THE TYMSAT SLOT IS RUNNING AND NO
               LOG-INS ARE YET PRESENT.


               IT APPEARS TO BE A SOFTWARE BUG WHICH IS CONFIGURATION
               DEPENDENT, SO DON@T EXPECT THE SYMPTOM TO MANIFEST ITSELF
               IN ALL MACHINES RUNNING TYMSAT SLOT UNDER ISIS.

ACTION:        UNTIL THE BUG IS FIXED, THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURES SHOULD HELP
               IN RELIEVING THE SYMPTOM:-

       (1)     DEPRESS 'INIT' BUTTON ON CONSOLE WHILE THE CODE IS RUNNING.
               THIS CAUSES SYSTEM CLEAR TO BE GENERATED AND THE CODE TO
               RE-INITIALIZE.
         NOTE: IT IS MANDATORY THAT ECO'S 79-53 AND 79-54 BE INSTALLED
               IF YOU PERFORM ACTION ITEM #1. ATTEMPTING THIS, WHILE
               NOT HAVING THESE ECO'S INSTALLED, WILL RESULT IN CAUSING
               A MEMORY PARITY ERROR AT THE LOCATION OF EXECUTION AT THE
               TIME THE "INIT" BUTTON WAS DEPRESSED. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE
               THESE ECO'S IN A MACHINE WHICH IS EXHIBITTING THIS
               PROBLEM YOU ARE ADVISED TO ATTEMPT ACTION ITEM #2 AS AN
               ALTERNATIVE PROCEDURE.

       (2)     HALT THE CODE, AND RESTART FROM ADDRESS '70'.

       (3)     HALT THE TYMSAT SLOT AND RESTART THE SLOT.

NOTE:          DO NOT USE ALL THREE METHODS - IT APPEARS THAT DIFFERENT
               SOLUTIONS ARE APPLICABLE TO THE PARTICULAR CONFIGURATION.
               (HOPE YOURS IS AMONGST THOSE ABOVE)

               ALSO, AFTER YOU GET TRANSMIT DATA IN THE CORRECT STATE IT
               APPEARS TO REMAIN CORRECT UNTIL THE MACHINE IS EITHER
               RESTARTED OR RELOADED.

               TO ASSIST IN GATHERING INFO FOR DEBUGGING - IF YOU SEE THIS
               SYMPTOM PLEASE SEND ME INFO RE. NODE # AND CODE.

RESOLUTION:    THE ISIS DEVELOPMENT GROUP HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THIS
               PROBLEM AND HAVE MANAGED TO RECREATE IT IN A LAB ENVIRONMENT
               IT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A BUG DURING INITIALISATION OF
               THE CODE DUE TO HAVING INTERRUPTS DISABLED FOR SUFFICIENT
               TIME TO INTERFERE WITH THE ASYNC RING HANDLING.
               IF TESTING OF THE NEW CODE IS SUCCESSFUL A NEW VERSION WILL
               BE RELEASED IN APPROXIMATELY TWO WEEKS TIME.

SUBJECT:  ENGINE MICROCODE DIAGNOSTIC DISPLAYING "1E9 DEAD"



               THERE APPEARS TO BE RECURRING INCIDENTS IN THE FIELD OF
               CRASHES ON ENGINES RESULTING IN A CONSOLE DISPLAY OF
               '1E9 DEAD'.
               WHAT EXACTLY DOES THIS MEAN? -
               THE CPU HAS SEEN (VIA THE ATN0 LINE GOING ACTIVE) THAT
               A DEVICE ON THE I/O BUS WANTS TO INTERRUPT. AS THERE
               MAY BE MULTIPLE DEVICES ON THE I/O BUS ALL INTERRUPTING
               THE CPU, THE CPU SENDS OUT TACK0/RACK0 TO LATCH UP THE
               HIGHEST PRIORITY INTERRUPT.
               RACK0 IS TRAPPED BY THE DEVICE AND IT WILL THEN PUT ITS
               ADDRESS ON THE I/O BUS. WHEN THE ADDRESS IS STABLE THE
               DEVICE SENDS SYN0 BACK TO THE CPU AND THE CPU THEN
               TAKES THE ADDRESS OFF THE BUS AND UTILISES IT TO ENTER
               THE APPROPRIATE INTERRUPT ROUTINE.

               A CRASH OF '1E9 DEAD' MEANS THAT THE CPU TIMED OUT
               AWAITING THE SYN0 REPONSE AFTER SENDING RACK0.

               THIS CAN BE DUE TO A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS:

          (1)  THE RACK0/TACK0 CHAIN IS BROKEN ABOVE THE SLOT
               CONTAINING THE INTERRUPTING DEVICE. I.E. THE DEVICE
               WILL NEVER RECEIVE RACK0, AND HENCE WILL NEVER
               RESPOND WITH SYN0.

          (2)  NOISE ON RACK0 LINE CAUSES THE DEVICE TO THINK THE
               CPU HAS ALREADY SEEN SYN0 AND HAS TAKEN THE ADDRESS
               OFF THE BUS. THE DEVICE CLEARS ITS INTERRUPT AND DROPS
               SYN0 BEFORE THE CPU HAS ACTUALLY LOOKED AT SYN0.


ACTION:        SOLUTION TO PROBLEM (1) IS OBVIOUSLY TO ENSURE THE
               RACK0/TACK0 CHAIN IS CORRECT ON THE BACKPLANE.

               SOLUTION TO PROBLEM (2) IS DEPENDENT ON THE NOISE
               SOURCE FOR THE RACK0/TACK0 CHAIN.

           (A) POSSIBLE CAUSE IS IC AT LOCATION "C8" ON MULTIFUNCTION
               BOARD (ASB 252-1). IF THIS CHIP IS A 74LS244, CHANGE TO
               A 74S244. (REFER TO ECO 79-45).

           (B) ANOTHER SOURCE OF NOISE CAN BE THE I/O CONTROL SIGNAL
               RECEIVERS ON THE SYNC I/F (ASB 212-1). IC CHIP AT
               LOCATION D2 IS A 74LS04. IT CAN BE CHANGED TO A 7404
               BUT THIS IS NOT A STANDARD CHANGE AND IS NOT RECOMMENDED
               UNTIL AN ECO IS RELEASED. (AN ECO IS DUE FOR RELEASE FROM
               ENGINEERING. AS SOON AS IT IS, THIS BULLETIN WILL BE
               UPDATED).

         NOTE: CHECK ALSO THE FOLLOWING ECO'S ARE INSTALLED ON THE
               MULTIFUNCTION CARD-

HARDWARE:  INTERDATA7/32
SUBJECT:  3600 BAUD CLOCK OUTPUT FROM MULTI-FUNCTION CARD (ASB197-3)


PROBLEM:       A SCHEMATIC ERROR EXISTS ON PAGE 2 OF 12 FOR THE WIRE-WRAP
               MULTIFUNCTION CARD (ASB197-3). AT CO-ORDS G3, THE 3600
               OUTPUT OF IC E6 PIN 6 IS SHOWN GOING TO THE BACKPLANE PIN
               125 CONNECTOR 0. ON THE BOARD ITSELF, THE 3600 OUTPUT GOES
               TO THE BACKPLANE PIN 225 CONNECTOR 0. AN ECO IS BEING
               GENERATED TO CORRECT THIS SCHEMATIC ERROR.
               THE 3600 OUTPUT IS USED TO CLOCK THE TRANSMIT DATA LATCHES
               ON THE ASYNCHRONOUS INTERFACE. ON INTERDATA 7/32'S, THIS
               WAS INCORPORATED BY ECO'S 77-4, 77-5, & 77-6.
               ECO 77-4 REVISED THE MULTIFUNCTION CARD (ASB197-2) TO LEVEL
               3 BY PROVIDING THE 3600 OUTPUT.
               ECO 77-5 REVISED THE I/O BACKPLANE TO PROVIDE 3600 OUTPUT
               ON ALL SLOTS WHERE THE ASYNC CARD MAY BE INSTALLED.
               ECO 77-6 REVISED THE ASYNC I/F ITSELF TO INCORPORATE THE
               TRANSMIT DATA LATCHES.
               IT IS IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT ECO 77-5 WAS INSTALLED
               CORRECTLY ON INTERDATA 7/32'S TO PICK UP THE 3600 OUTPUT
               FROM PIN 225 AND NOT PIN 125 OF THE MULTIFUNCTION CARD SLOT.

               EVIDENTLY THIS ECO WAS INSTALLED INCORRECTLY IN SOME MACHINES,
               AS PER THE SCHEMATIC ERROR, RESULTING IN NO TRANSMIT DATA, AND
               THUS DEAD PORTS.

        NOTE:  THE NEW MULTIFUNCTION CARD (ASB252-1) ALSO OUTPUTS 3600 ON
               PIN 225 CONNECTOR 0.
               ON THE TYMNET ENGINE, FOR ALL I/O SLOTS:
               PIN 125 IS CONNECTED BY CHAIN DOWN BACKPLANE
               PIN 225 IS CONNECTED BY CHAIN DOWN BACKPLANE
               ALSO, THE ASYNC I/F (ASB211-1) ON BOARD JUMPERS PIN 125 TO
               PIN 225 ON CONNECTOR 0.
               HENCE, THE WIRE-WRAP MULTIFUNCTION CARD (ASB197-3) IN A TYMNET
               ENGINE, DOES NOT EXHIBIT THIS PROBLEM.
               IT WILL ONLY BE EVIDENT ON INTERDATA 7/32'S WHERE THE BACK-
               PLANE REVISION WAS INSTALLED INCORRECTLY BY PICKING OFF THE
               3600 OUTPUT FROM THE MULTIFUNCTION CARD SLOT ON PIN 125
               INSTEAD OF PIN 225 CONNECTOR 0.

               IF YOU CAN SEE A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF LIGHT THROUGH THE
               FILTER IT IS O.K. AND MAY BE REUSED. IF YOU CAN SEE ALMOST
               NO LIGHT THROUGH FILTER, DISCARD IT AND REPLACE GRILL
               WITHOUT ANY FILTER MATERIAL. (THERE IS A SECONDARY FILTER
               BEHIND THE GRILL WHICH WILL PREVENT EXCESSIVE DIRT OR
               PARTICLES FROM ENTERING THE MACHINE.)

       NOTE:   THE INCORRECT MATERIAL IS A DARK GREY FOAM WHICH CLOSELY
               RESEMBLES "PACKING MATERIAL" AS OPPOSED TO A POROUS FILTER

SUBJECT:  ENGINE REMOTE CODE ERROR HALTS/DISPLAYS


               THE FOLLOWING BULLETIN DESCRIBES THE ERROR HALTS THAT CAN
               OCCUR DURING ENGINE REMOTE CODE EXECUTION. THE HALT
               INDICATIONS SHOULD ASSIST IN UTILISING THE CODE TO
               DETERMINE MACHINE PROBLEMS.
               THE SOURCE INFORMATION FOR THIS BULLETIN WAS DERIVED FROM
               THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENT: (RFORKISH:33)FE422.DOC

               1. CODE HALTS AT LOCATION "81" OR "82" IMMEDIATELY AFTER
                 RESTART OR HALTS AT LOCATION "810" ANYTIME - MACHINE IS
                 GENERATING AN INTERRUPT ON A DEVICE NOT EXPECTED BY THE
                 REMOTE CODE. THE OFFENDING DEVICE ADDRESS IS IN REGISTER
                 2 OF REGISTER SET 0 (MACHINE IS IN REGISTER SET 0 AFTER
                 INTERRUPT IS TAKEN).

               2. MACHINE DISPLAYS "BAD1" ON LEFT HALF OF CONSOND A
                 VALUE FROM "22" TO "5F" ON RIGHT HALF OF CONSOLE -
                 MACHINE IS GENERATING AN INTERRUPT ON A SYNCHRONOUS LINE
                 WHICH IS NOT VALID FOR THIS CONFIGURATION. THE RIGHT
                 CONSOLE VALUE INDICATES THE OFFENDING ADDRESS: "22" OR "23"
                 FOR SYNC LINE 1, "24" OR "25" FOR SYNC LINE 2, "3E" OR "3F"
                 FOR SYNC LINE 15, "40" OR "41" FOR SYNC LINE 16, "5E" OR
                 "5F" FOR SYNC LINE 31. THIS PROBLEM CAUSES A HALT AT
                 LOCATION "84" IN CODE RELEASES PRIOR TO VERSION 422, WITH
                 THE OFFENDING ADDRESS IN REGISTER 2 OF SET 0.
                 TYPICAL CAUSES OF THIS HALT ARE:-

               (A) A SYNC LINE HAS BEEN CONNECTED FOR WHICH THE CODE HAS
                  NOT BEEN ASSEMBLED. CHECK THE LINES CONNECTED AGAINST
                  THE .TYM FILE FOR THIS CONFIGURATION.
               (B) A HARDWIRED CLOCK SOURCE HAS BEEN JUMPERED ON THE SYNC
                  CARD TO A LINE NOT ASSEMBLED IN THIS CODE.
               (C) NOISE ON THE TRANSMIT AND/OR RECEIVE CLOCK PATH IS
                  CAUSING SPURIOUS INTERRUPTS TO BE GENERATED FOR
                  UNASSIGNED LINES.

               3. CODE HALTS AT LOCATION "2D0" IMMEDIATELY AFTER STARTUP.
                  PROBABLY CAUSED BY .TYM FILE ERROR IN SPECIFYING MORE
                  MEMORY THAN THE MACHINE ACTUALLY CONTAINS, ALTHOUGH
                  COULD BE CAUSED BY MEMORY FAILURE. CHECK "NBRK" PARAMETER
                  IN .TYM FILE.

               4. CODE HALTS AT LOCATION "238" IMMEDIATELY AFTER STARTUP.
                  REMOTE PURPOSELY MADE AN ILLEGAL MEMORY REFERRENCE, BUT
                  DID NOT GET A MACHINE MALFUNCTION INTERRUPT. MEMORY PARITY
                  NOT WORKING CORRECTLY.

               5. CODE HALTS AT LOCATION "38" ANYTIME (MACHINE MALFUNCTION).
                  CONDITION CODE IN PSW INDICATES SPECIFIC CAUSE OF INTERRUPT

                  CONDITION CODE            CAUSE

                                                                FAILURE)
                  X001                 POWER FAILURE
                  0010                 PARITY ERROR ON INSTRUCTION FETCH
                  X100                 PARITY ERROR ON DATA FETCH

                  THE OLD PSW IS SAVED IN LOCATIONS "20 - 27", AND
                  CONTAINS THE STATE OF THE MACHINE WHEN THE MACHINE
                  MALFUNCTION INTERRUPT WAS TAKEN.
       NOTE:      LOCATIONS "348" AND "34A" SHOULD CONTAIN THE MEMORY
                  ADDRESS WHICH CAUSED THE PARITY ERROR.

               6. CODE HALTS AT LOCATION "30" ANYTIME (ILLEGAL INSTRUCTION).
                  THE OLD PSW IS SAVED IN REGISTERS 14 (E) AND 15 (F) OF
                  SET 0 (THE MACHINE IS IN REGISTER SET 0 WHEN THE INTERRUPT
                  IS TAKEN). REGISTER 15 (F) POINTS TO THE LOCATION OF THE
                  ILLEGAL INSTRUCTION.

               7. UNUSUAL CONSOLE DISPLAY FLASHING EVERY SECOND. A NEW
                  OPTION IN THE REMOTE CODE CALLS FOR COUNTING CHARACTERS
                  PER SECOND PASSING THROUGH THE NODE. THE CHARACTER COUNT
                  AND THE HIGH-WATER MARK ARE DISPLAYED ON THE CONSOLE
                  EVERY OTHER SECOND AS FOLLOWS:

                  TYPICALLY, THE LOW-ORDER DIGIT FLASHES 0 TO 1 OR 0 TO 2
                  IF IN THE NETWORK AND TAKEN OVER. IF "CPS" IS ENABLED,
                  THE FLASH OF 1 OR 2 IS UNCHANGED. INSTEAD OF FLASHING THE
                  LOW-ORDER DIGIT OF 0, THE ENTIRE CONSOLE DISPLAYS "CPS"
                  INFORMATION. THE LEFT-HALF OF THE CONSOLE CONTAINS THE
                  HIGHEST SECOND'S COUNT OF CHARACTERS SINCE THE LAST NODE
                  CRASH (HIGH-WATER MARK). THE RIGHT-HALF OF THE CONSOLE
                  DISPLAYS THE CURRENT SECOND'S CPS COUNT, REFLECTING THE
                  CURRENT TRAFFIC ON THE MACHINE.

               8. PASSTHROUGH COUNT ON CONSOLE FOR OVER 256 PASSTHROUGHS.
                  THE 2ND BYTE FROM THE RIGHT ON THE CONSOLE DISPLAYS THE
                  NUMBER OF PASSTHROUGH CIRCUITS ON THIS NODE. SINCE ONLY
                  8 BITS ARE AVAILABLE FOR COUNTING, THERE IS A PROBLEM IF
                  THERE ARE OVER 256 PASSTHROUGHS ON THE MACHINE. THE
                  PROBLEM IS SOLVED BY DISPLAYING 1 TO 3 ON THE LOW-ORDER
                  DIGIT INSTEAD OF 0 TO 2. THEREFORE, IF THERE ARE 260
                  PASSTHROUGH CIRCUITS ON A NODE, THE PASSTHROUGH COUNT
                  FIELD ON THE CONSOLE WILL DISPLAY "04", AND THE LOW-ORDER
                  DIGIT FLICKERS BETWEEN 1 AND 3.

       NOTES:  1. THE SYNC/ASYNC TEST WILL RUN ON BOTH INTERDATA 7/32'S AND
                  TYMNET ENGINES. I AM CURRENTLY REVISING THIS TEST TO
                  RUN ON THE "ENHANCED ENGINE" AND EXPANDING THE DIAGNOSTIC
                  COMMANDS. VERSION 4 OF THIS TEST SHOULD BE AVAILABLE
                  10/15/79.
               2. THE SYNC/ASYNC TEST REQUIRES LOOPBACK OF DATA, CLOCKS,

                  LINES/PORTS THIS MAY BE ACHIEVED BY PUTTING THE MODEMS
                  IN LOOPBACK. HOWEVER, FOR TESTING COMPLETE CARDS IT IS
                  MORE CONVENIENT TO USE LOOPBACK PLUGS ON THE RIBBON
                  CABLE CONNECTORS. THESE LOOPBACK DIAGNOSTIC PLUGS ARE

HARDWARE:  VARIAN
SUBJECT:  REPLACING V77 MOS MEMORY WITH DATARAM DR477 MEMORY


     1.  REMOVE THE LOWER RIGHT-HAND MEMORY TERMINATOR FROM THE
         BACKPLANE.  ITS POSITION ON THE BACKPLANE IS DESIGNATED J4.

     2.  WIRE-WRAP FROM J4 PIN 57 TO PIN 104 OF ANY CPU SLOT.  WIRE-WRAP
         FROM J4 PIN 59 TO PIN 105 OF ANY CPU SLOT.  THESE TWO SIGNALS
         (SPFA AND SRST) ARE NORMALLY SENT BY THE MEMORY TIMING-CONTROL
         BOARD TO THE CPU.  USING THE NEW DATARAM MEMORY CONFIGURATION,
         A POWER SUPPLY FAILURE IS SENSED BY THE DATARAM BECAUSE
         THE TWO WIRE CURRENT CABLE NOW CONNECTS TO THE DATARAM CHASSIS
         INSTEAD OF TO THE MEMORY TIMING-CONTROL BOARD.  THIS TWO WIRE
         CABLE IS USED FOR POWER FAIL SENSING.  WHEN THE DATARAM SENSES
         A LOSS OF CURRENT FLOW THROUGH THE TWO WIRE CABLE IT CLAMPS
         J4-57 AND J4-59 TO GROUND TO NOTIFY THE CPU.  THE PINS ON J4 ARE
         NUMBERED SO THAT THE LEFT ROW ARE THE ODD NUMBERED PINS.
         PINS 59 AND 57 ARE THE BOTTOM LEFT PIN AND THE SECOND FROM BOTTOM
         LEFT PIN.

     3.  NOW TAKE THE DATARAM DUAL RIBBON CABLE ASSEMBLY WITH
         THE END THAT LOOKS LIKE A TERMINATOR CARD.  PLUG THE TERMINATOR-
         LIKE CARD ONTO J4 OF THE BACKPLANE MAKING SURE THAT PINS 1 AND 2
         ARE UP.  CONNECT THE RED WIRE FROM THIS CARD ONTO ONE OF THE +5V
         PINS OF THE V77 BACKPLANE.  NOW BRING THE TWO ATTACHED RIBBON CABLES
         TO THE REAR OF THE DATARAM CHASSIS.

     4.  AT THE REAR OF THE DATARAM CHASSIS ARE EIGHT CONNECTORS.  IGNORE
         THE LOWER GROUP OF FOUR AS THEY ARE FOR THE "A"PORT.  PLUG THE
         J1 CABLE INTO THE UPPER RIGHT CONNECTOR.  PLUG THE J2 CABLE INTO
         THE CONNECTOR BELOW IT.  TWO TERMINATOR BOARDS ARE PROVIDED.
         THEY ARE LABELLED "A" AND "B".  PLUG TERMINATOR "A" INTO THE UPPER
         LEFT CONNECTOR AND PLUG THE +5V WIRE FROM THE TERMINATOR ONTO
         THE UPPER LEFT +5V PIN JUST ABOVE THE CONNECTOR.  PLUG TERMINATOR
         "B" INTO THE CONNECTOR BELOW TERMINATOR "A" AND PLUG THE +5V WIRE
         FROM THE TERMINATOR ONTO THE +5V PIN JUST BELOW THE OTHER +5V PIN.

     5.  REMOVE THE MEMORY ARRAY BOARD AND THE TIMING-CONTROL BOARD FROM THE
         V77 CHASSIS.  TAKE THE TWO-WIRE POWER FAIL CABLE THAT
         WAS PLUGGED INTO THE TIMING-CONTROL BOARD AND PLUG IT INTO THE
         3-PIN CONNECTOR LABELLED "B" AT THE REAR OF THE DATARAM CHASSIS.
         THIS CONNECTOR WILL NOW BE ROTATED 90 DEGREES CLOCKWISE FROM THE WAY
         IT WAS PLUGGED INTO THE TIMING-CONTROL BOARD.

     6.  CONFIGURE THE DR477 MEMORY INTERFACE BOARD AS FOLLOWS:
      (A)  INSTALL THE STRAPPING PLATFORM LABELLED "1-MOD" IN LOCATION B8.
           OPEN IT FIRST AND MAKE SURE THAT THE ONLY CONNECTION MADE IS
           FROM PIN 1 TO PIN 16.
      (B)  SET THE DIP SWITCH IN LOCATION C10 AS DESIGNATED BELOW:

            SW   1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10
                OFF  ON   OFF  ON   OFF  ON   OFF  OFF   OFF   OFF

     (C)   DISREGARD THE SWITCH SETTINGS AT LOCATION B4.  THIS IS FOR "A"
           PORT.
      (D)  DISREGARD THE STRAPPING PLATFORM AT LOCATION C5.  THIS IS FOR
           "A" PORT.
      (E)  CONNECT E9 TO E10 TO ENABLE "B" PORT OF THE DATARAM.
      (F)  REMOVE JUMPER BETWEEN E11 AND E12 TO ENABLE "B" PORT POWER FAIL
           CAPABILITY.

     7.   INSTALL THE DR477 MEMORY INTERFACE BOARD IN THE LOWEST SLOT OF
          THE DATARAM CHASSIS.

     8.   INSTALL THE DATARAM CORE MEMORY BOARD (DR 103) IN THE HIGHEST SLOT.

     9.   THE CIRCULAR SWITCH (HAVING POSITIONS 0 TO F) ON THE CORE MEMORY
          BOARD SHOULD BE SET TO ZERO.

    10.   CURRENTLY TYMSHARE IS USING THE DATARAM DR 103 CORE MEMORY BOARD
          PART NUMBER 60309.  THIS IS 16K BY 18 BITS.

    11.   THE SMALL LED "DS1" ON THE FRONT OF THE CORE MEMORY BOARD SHOULD
          BE ON ONLY WHEN A PROGRAM IS RUNNING IN MEMORY.  IT SHOULD BE OFF
          WHEN THE CPU HAS HALTED.

    12.   SINCE THE DATARAM DR477 MEMORY IS SLOWER THAN THE MOS MEMORY, THE
          ASYNC BOOTSTRAPS MUST HAVE STBAUD AND BAUD VALUES CHANGED
          AS FOLLOWS:

SUBJECT:  UPGRADE OF TYMNET ENGINE TO "ENHANCED ENGINE"


               THIS BULLETIN PROVIDES SOME TIPS AND TYPICAL PROBLEMS
               ASSOCIATED WITH UPGRADING A TYMNET ENGINE TO RUN WITH
               "ENHANCED MICROCODE".

       1.      THE ROM & I/O BOARD SHOULD HAVE PROM CHIPS MARKED "E15'-00
               THROUGH E15'-23". THE MAPPING PROMS ON THIS BOARD SHOULD
               BE MARKED "EM15'-0 & EM15'-1".

       2.      THE MULTIFUNCTION CARD SHOULD BE STRAPPED FOR THE FOLLOWING
               OPTIONS:
                               OPTION X - PIN 2 TO PIN 3
                               OPTION Y - PIN 2 TO PIN 3
                               OPTION Z - PIN 2 TO PIN 3

       3.      ON THE CPU BACKPLANE, SLOT 4 CONNECTOR 0, THE FOLLOWING
               TWO JUMPERS SHOULD BE REMOVED:
                               PIN 122 TO PIN 222
                               PIN 134 TO PIN 234

       4.      ASYNCHRONOUS CARD ADDRESSES WILL DEPEND ON THE .TYM FILE
               FOR YOUR CONFIGURATION.
               THE NORMAL ADDRESS RANGES FOR THE ASYNC CARDS ARE:

                               ADDRESS RANGE           ASYNC CARD
                               *************           **********

                               91 - 97                 ASYNC CARD #1
                               99 - 9F                 ASYNC CARD #2
                               A1 - A7                 ASYNC CARD #3
                               A9 - AF                 ASYNC CARD #4

               THE "ENHANCED 256 PORT" ADDRESS RANGE IS AS FOLLOWS:

                               ADDRESS RANGE           ASYNC CARD
                               *************           **********

                               C1 - C7                 ASYNC CARD #1
                               C9 - CF                 ASYNC CARD #2
                               D1 - D7                 ASYNC CARD #3
                               D9 - DF                 ASYNC CARD #4
                               E1 - E7                 ASYNC CARD #5
                               E9 - EF                 ASYNC CARD #6
                               F1 - F7                 ASYNC CARD #7
                               F9 - FF                 ASYNC CARD #8

               IF THE .TYM FILE SPECIFIES:

               NACARD     EQ      4 (OR LESS)
               MICRO      EQ      1
               N.ADA      EQ      0

               THE NORMAL ADDRESS RANGE WOULD BE EXPECTED BY THE CODE.
               ADDRESS THE ASYNC CARDS ACCORDINGLY.

               IF THE .TYM FILE SPECIFIES:

               NACARD     EQ      4 (OR LESS)
               MICRO      EQ      1
               N.ADA      EQ      1

               THE "ENHANCED ADDRESS RANGE" WILL BE FORCED EVEN THOUGH
               THERE ARE 4 OR LESS ASYNC CARDS IN THE CONFIGURATION.

               IF THE .TYM FILE SPECIFIES:

               NACARD     EQ      5 (OR MORE)
               MICRO      EQ      1
               N.ADA      EQ      0

               THE "ENHANCED ADDRESS RANGE" WILL BE FORCED BY THE DEFINITION
               OF 5 OR MORE ASYNC CARDS.

SUBJECT:  TYMNET ENGINE BACKPLANE NOISE PROBLEM


       THIS BULLETIN HIGHLIGHTS A POTENTIAL NOISE PROBLEM WHICH IS
       CURRENTLY UNDER EXAMINATION BY ENGINEERING AND WHICH COULD MANIFEST
       ITSELF IN A NUMBER OF WAYS DEPENDING ON MACHINE CONFIGURATION,
       BACKPLANE REVISION, AND MACHINE LOADING. THE PROBLEM IS NOT
       ABSOLUTELY IDENTIFIABLE AT PRESENT BUT IS KNOWN TO BE CONNECTED
       TO VARIOUS CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MUX (I/O) BUS.

       THE PROBLEM WAS FIRST IDENTIFIED IN THE NETWORK SUPERVISORS
       AND REPRODUCED IN A LAB ENVIRONMENT. IN THE CASE OF SUP MACHINES, IT
       EXHIBITED ITSELF IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER:
       DMA ACCESS ADDRESSES TO CORE WERE BEING CORRUPTED CAUSING DATA FROM
       DISC TO BE STORED IN INCORRECT MEMORY LOCATIONS. ILLEGAL INSTRUCTION
       CRASHES (WHERE THE INSTRUCTION FETCHED WAS IN FACT CORRECT COULD
       ALSO BE ANOTHER MANIFESTATION OF THIS PROBLEM). TECHNICAL SUPPORT
       AND ENGINEERING WORKED ON THIS PROBLEM AND FOUND THAT THE LOCATION
       OF THE SYNC I/F WITHIN THE MACHINE HAD A MARKED EFFECT ON SUSCEPTIBILITY
       TO ERRORS. THUS FAR OUR TESTING HAS INDICATED THAT MOVING THE SYNC
       I/F TO THE SLOT DIRECTLY BENEATH THE MULTIFUNCTION CARD (I.E. SLOT 3
       OF THE UPPER CPU CHASSIS) HAS ELIMINATED THE ERRORS THAT WE WERE
       MONITORING.

       YOU ARE RECOMMENDED TO MAKE THIS CHANGE TO ANY ENGINE THAT IS
       SUFFERING FROM SPORADIC CRASHES ATTRIBUTABLE TO INVALID MEMORY
       REFERRENCES. IN PARTICULAR, I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BE DONE ON
       LARGE CONFIGURATIONS SUCH AS THE PUBLIC/PRIVATE NETWORK SUPERVISORS
       TOGETHER WITH ANY LARGE ISIS/REMOTE NODES.
       AN ECO TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM AND REVERT TO NORMAL CONFIGURING
       SHOULD BE FORTHCOMING WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.

EFFECTIVE CHANGE:              REMOVE SYNC CARD FROM CURRENT SLOT AND
                               REINSTAL IN SLOT 3 CPU CHASSIS. (REMOVE
                               RACK0/TACK0  JUMPER BETWEEN PINS 122 AND
                               222, CONNECTOR 0 , SLOT 3)
                               INSTAL JUMPER BETWEEN PINS 122 AND 222
                               ON CONNECTOR 0 OF THE SLOT FROM WHICH YOU
                               REMOVED THE SYNC CARD.

SUBJECT:  5-VOLT NOISE PROBLEM ON TYMNET ENGINE EXPANSION CHASSIS


PROBLEM:       TYMNET ENGINES WITH DUAL CHASSIS (DMA CAPABILITY) ARE
               CURRENTLY IN THE FIELD. IT HAS BEEN NORMAL PROCEDURE TO
               SEND THESE CONFIGURATIONS INTO THE FIELD WITH THE CONNECTOR 0
               TERMINATOR ON THE LOWEST (SLOT 0) SLOT  IN THE MACHINE AND
               THE CONNECTOR 1 TERMINATOR ON THE SLOT DIRECTLY ABOVE THE
               LOWER CONNECTION POINT FOR THE DMA CABLE. IN THE PARTICULAR
               CASE WHERE NO CARDS ARE INSTALLED IN THE LOWER 16 SLOTS IN
               THE MACHINE, A POTENTIAL PROBLEM HAS BEEN FOUND IN THE
               AMOUNT OF NOISE OBSERVED ON THE 5 VOLT FEEDS TO THE LOWER
               CHASSIS, THE ONLY LOAD PRESENTED BEING THE PULL-UP LOAD OF
               TERMINATORS. THIS COULD CAUSE A POTENTIAL PROBLEM OF NOISE
               BEING INJECTED ONTO THE MEMORY ADDRESS, MEMORY DATA, OR I/O
               BUS VIA THE TERMINATORS. THIS PROBLEM IS MINIMISED AS PC
               CARDS ARE ADDED TO THE LOWER 16 SLOTS, PROVIDING SUFFICIENT
               LOAD TO DAMPEN THE NOISE.

ACTION:        IN THE PARTICULAR CONFIGURATION INDICATED ABOVE, MOVE THE
               CONNECTOR 0 TERMINATOR UP TO SLOT 1, LOWER SECTION OF
               THE CPU CHASSIS. MOVE THE CONNECTOR 1 TERMINATOR (FOR THE
               (MEMORY SENSE/DATA BUSSES AND I/O BUS) TO THE LOWEST SLOT
               OF THE CPU CHASSIS.

RESOLUTION:    TECH SUPPORT IS WORKING WITH ENGINEERING IN PROVIDING AN ECO
               WHICH WILL EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATE NOISE ON THE 5 VOLT LINE IN
               AN UN-LOADED CONFIGURATION.

SUBJECT:  POWERING DOWN THE TYMNET ENGINE


WARNING:       BOTH THE LAMBDA AND PIONEER MAGNETICS POWER SUPPLIES HAVE
               EXCEPTIONALLY LONG HOLD-UP TIMES, IN ORDER FOR THE SYSTEM
               TO SUSTAIN MOMENTARY LOSSES OF POWER WITHOUT INTERRUPTION
               TO THE D.C. VOLTAGES ON THE SYSTEM. THE HOLD-UP ENERGY OF
               THE SUPPLY IS STORED IN A LARGE CAPACITOR, INTEGRAL TO THE
               SUPPLY, WHOSE DISCHARGE RATE IS DEPENDENT ON THE AMOUNT OF
               HARDWARE CONFIGURED INTO THE SYSTEM.

               THIS MEANS THAT WHEN YOU DROP POWER TO THE SYSTEM EITHER
               FROM THE CONSOLE KEY SWITCH OR THROUGH THE AC SUPPLY, D.C.
               VOLTAGES ARE STILL BEING DELIVERED TO THE BOARDS UNTIL THE
               STORED ENERGY IS DISSIPATED FROM THE CAPACITOR. THIS IS
               REFLECTED IN THE LED "L3" ON THE MULTIFUNCTION CARD REMAINING
               LIT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME (DEPENDING ON DISCHARGE RATE) AFTER
               POWER SHUT-OFF.
               CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN IN WAITING FOR THAT LED TO EXTINGUISH
               PRIOR TO REMOVING BOARDS FROM THE SYSTEM DURING MAINTENANCE
               ACTIVITIES.

    B.  VERSION 430 HARDWARE CHANGE REQUIREMENTS

        TO UTILIZE THE ENHANCED SYNCHRONOUS FEATURES, AN ENGINE MUST
        HAVE THE FOLLOWING HARDWARE CHANGES INSTALLED:

        1.)  ENHANCED SYNCHRONOUS MICROCODE.

             A.  MAPPING PROMS:    MPS15-0  ROM & I/O POSITION H-2
                                   MPS15-1  ROM & I/O POSITION J-2

             B.  MICROCODE PROMS:  S15-00 THRU S15-07  ROM & I/O POS A3-A10

                                   S15-30 THRU S15-37  ROM & I/O POS D3-D10
             INSTRUCTIONS ADDED TO THE ENHANCED SYNCHRONOUS MICROCODE
             CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING:

                A.)  SCAN - SCANS THROUGH SYNC INPUT RING FOR DATA.
                B.)  ALIGN - ALIGNS DATA FROM INPUT RING INTO BUFFER.
                C.)  RTDCOPY - PERFORMS RECORD TEARDOWN AND COPY FUNCTION.
                D.)  RMAKECOPY - PERFORMS RECORD MAKER FUNCTION.
                E.)  CHECKSUM - PERFORMS VERTICL AND DIAGONAL CHECKSUM.
                F.)  GCI - GETS A CHARACTER FROM A SPECIFIED BUFFER.

             SYNC CARD INTERRUPTS MAY BE SERVICED IN MICROCODE BY SETTING
             BIT SIX (6) OF THE PSW 'ON' (HEX 0200).  IF BIT 6 IS RESET,
             CONVENTIONAL INTERRUPTS ARE TAKEN.

        2.)  THE CPU BACKPLANE MUST BE MODIFIED TO ACCOMODATE INTERRUPT
             LEVEL "1" IN PLACE OF INTERRUPT LEVEL "2" FOR THE
             SYNCHRONOUS CARD.

             REMOVE  RACK10/TACK10 BYPASS JUMPER AND INSTALL
             RACK20/TACK20 BYPASS JUMPER FOR CARD SLOT(S) WITH
             SYNCHRONOUS BOARDS INSTALLED.

             RACK10     D2-5    127-0                                       ]
             TACK10     E1-6    227-0                                       ]

        4.)  THIS CHANGE APPLIES TO MACHINES WITH THE FOLLOWING
             REVISON LEVELS ONLY.

             CPU AND/OR BACKPLANE AFFECTED:   ALL

             SYNCHRONOUS I/O BOARD PART NUMBER:  ASB212-1  REVISION: ALL

    C.  SOFTWARE COMPATABILITY.

        THE ENGINE ENHANCED SYNC MODIFIED AS ABOVE IS DOWNWARD COMPATABLE
        WITH PREVIOUS RELEASES OF REMOTE CODE.

        VERSION 430 ENGINE REMOTE CODE MAY BE RUN ON ALL THREE LEVELS OF
        ENGINES BY USING THE APPROPRIATE DEFINITION OF "MICRO" IN THE
        .TYM FILE.  I.E. NON-ENHANCED, ENHANCED ASYNC, ENHANCED ASYNC
        WITH ENHANCED SYNC.

    D.  SOFTWARE FEATURES ADDED TO VERSION 430

        1.)  THE VERSION NUMBER CONTAINED IN THE REMOTE CODE REFLECTS
             THE PRESENCE OF ENHANCED SYNC MICROCODE SUPPORT AND/OR
             ENHANCED ASYNC MICROCODE SUPPORT AS FOLLOWS:

             IF MICRO  EQ  0,  VERSION NUMBER WILL EQUAL 000430 (OCTAL)
             IF MICRO  EQ  1,  VERSION NUMBER WILL EQUAL 100430 (OCTAL)
             IF MICRO  EQ  2,  VERSION NUMBER WILL EQUAL 140430 (OCTAL)














        2.)  THE FOLLOWING PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT COUNTERS ARE ADDED
             FEATURES OF THE REMOTE CODE:

             A.  NUMBER OF BUFFER ZAPS
             B.  NUMBER OF PRINTER CHARACTERS OUTPUT
             C.  NUMBER OF DOWNLINE LOAD INPUT CHARACTERS
             D.  NUMBER OF DOWNLINE LOAD OUTPUT CHARACTERS
             E.  NUMBER OF PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT OUTPUT CHARACTERS
             F.  NUMBER OF ASYNC NOISE CHARACTERS INPUT

        3.)  EXPANDED BUFFER STORAGE
             THE AMOUNT OF BUFFER STORAGE IN THE NODE IS NO LONGER
             RESTRICTED TO A MAXIMUM OF 64K BYTES.  VERSION
             430 ALLOWS ALL UNUSED MEMORY AVAILABLE IN THE CONFIGURATION
             TO BE ALLOCATED AS BUFFER SPACE.

             THE MESSAGE: "BUFFER SPACE ALLOCATED = <N> BYTES DECIMAL"
             IS OUTPUT AT ASSEMBLY TIME TO INDICATE THE SIZE OF BUFFER
             STORAGE.

    E.  DELETIONS FROM VERSION 430 REMOTE CODE

        1.)  CIRCUIT TRACING FEATURES ADDED IN VERSION 426 ARE NO LONGER
             REQUIRED AND HAVE BEEN DELETED FROM VERSION 430.

    F.  SOFTWARE CORRECTIONS IN VERSION 430 REMOTE CODE

        1.)  A SOFTWARE ERROR HAS BEEN CORRECTED WHEREBY THE FORMAT OF
             A MESSAGE TO THE SUPERVISOR INDICATED THE WRONG SIZE FOR A
             BUFFER ZAPPED.  THE PREVIOUS VERSIONS INDICTED A BUFFER
             SIZE 8 TIMES LARGER THAN ACTUALLY OCCURRED.  THIS RESULTED
             IN NO VISIBLE AFFECT EXTERNAL TO THE SYSTEM.

        2.)  THE DOWNLINE LOAD LOGIC WITH PREVIOUS VERSIONS WOULD WAIT
             INDEFINITELY IF A BREAK IN COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE HOST
             SYSTEM OCCURRED DURING INITIATION OF THE DOWNLINE LOAD.
             A TIMER HAS BEEN ADDED TO VERSION 430 WHICH WILL TIME OUT
             IF TWO MINUTES HAS ELAPSED WITHOUT RECEIPT OF THE TARGET
             LINE NUMBER FROM THE HOST. THE CIRCUIT TO THE HOST
             IS ZAPPED UPON TIMEOUT.

MACHINES AFFECTED:             TYMNET ENGINE


PROBLEM:       IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT A NUMBER OF MACHINES WERE SHIPPED TO
               THE FIELD WITH THE INTERNAL DVM OUT OF CALIBRATION. THIS
               CAN CAUSE BOTH PROBLEMS IN THE OPERATION OF THE MACHINE AS
               WELL AS MARGINAL POWER FAIL DETECT OPERATION.

ACTION:        ON ALL ENGINES, CHECK WITH YOUR PORTABLE DVM THE +5, +16.5,
               AND -16.5 VOLTAGES ON THE BACKPLANE.
               (THE +5V SHOULD MEASURE +5.15 TO +5.20 ON THE BACKPLANE)
               IF THERE IS MORE THAN 100MILLIVOLTS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE
               VOLTAGE MEASURED AND THE VOLTAGE INDICATED ON THE INTERNAL
               DVM IN THE POWER SUPPLY, LABEL THE POWER SUPPLY METER AS
               UNCALIBRATED AND READJUST THE VOLTAGES TO THEIR CORRECT LEVELS
               WHILE THE MACHINE IS RUNNING.

SUBJECT:  MULTI-FUNCTION CARD WATCHDOG TIMER/BOOT SWITCH SETTINGS.


       THERE ARE TWO (2) REVISIONS OF THE MULTIFUNCTION CARD (ASB252-1)
       CURRENTLY IN THE FIELD WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF BOOT SWITCH.

       THE ASB252-1 REV C BOARD HAS A TWO POSITION BOOT SWITCH.
       WHEN THE SWITCH IS IN THE "DOWN" POSITION - THE WATCHDOG TIMER
       IS DISABLED.
       WHEN THE SWITCH IS IN THE "UP" POSITION - THE SYNC LOADER IS
       FORCED INTO CORE AND IF THE SWITCH IS LEFT "UP", THE WATCHDOG TIMER
       IS ENABLED. IF THE SWITCH IS PUT BACK TO THE "DOWN" POSITION,
       SUBSEQUENT TO FORCING THE SYNC LOADER INTO CORE, THE WATCHDOG TIMER
       WILL BE DISABLED.
       NOTE: A POTENTIAL PROBLEM EXISTS WITH THIS REV OF BOARD. THE CIRCUIT
       IS DESIGNED IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO CAUSE THE "BOOT
       FUNCTION" TO BE GENERATED IF THE SWITCH IS MOVED TO THE "DOWN"
       POSITION, TO DISABLE THE WATCHDOG TIMER, WHILE RUNNING CODE

       THE ASB252-1 REV D BOARD HAS A THREE (3) POSITION BOOT SWITCH.
       WHEN THE SWITCH IS IN THE "DOWN" POSITION, THE WATCHDOG TIMER IS
       ENABLED.
       WHEN THE SWITCH IS IN THE "CENTER" POSITION, THE WATCHDOG TIMER
       IS DISABLED.
       THE "UP" POSITION IS A MOMENTARY ACTION SWITCH CAUSING THE "SYNC
       LOADER" TO BE FORCED INTO CORE AND THE SWITCH WILL THEN RETURN TO
       THE CENTER POSITION.

ACTION PROBLEMS HAVE OCCURED  DUE TO THE INABILITY FOR NETWORK CONTROL
       TO PERFORM "DLOADS" ON MACHINES HAVING THE WATCHDOG TIMER DISABLED.

       THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURE SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED IMMEDIATELY:

       1.  ON ALL MACHINES HAVING SYNC LOADER PROMS AND SUITABLE SOFTWARE
           TO RESET THE WATCHDOG TIMER THE SWITCH SHOULD BE SET SUCH THAT
           THE WATCHDOG TIMER IS ENABLED.

           (ASB252-1) REV C:     SWITCH IN "UP" POSITION
           (ASB252-1) REV D:     SWITCH IN "DOWN" POSITION

       2.  THE WATCHDOG TIMER SHOULD ONLY BE DISABLED ON MACHINES SUFFERING
           REPETITIVE CRASHES WHEREBY CRASH ANALYSIS IS BEING HINDERED BY
           THE AUTOMATIC RETURN TO THE "SYNC LOADER". IN SUCH SITUATIONS,
           NETWORK CONTROL SHOULD ALWAYS BE INFORMED OF ANY MACHINE HAVING
           THE WATCHDOG TIMER DISABLED. THIS WILL PREVENT A "DLOAD" COMMAND
           BEING ISSUED TO THESE MACHINES AND SUBSEQUENT MAINTENANCE
           INTERVENTION.

HARDWARE:  DATAPRINTER
SUBJECT:  DATAPRINTER DPC/CDC I/O ADAPTER BOARD VERSIONS


WARNING:       THERE ARE TWO VERSIONS OF THE DATAPRINTER DPC/CDC I/O
               ADAPTER BOARD (#12056) AND ONLY ONE VERSION IS
               SUITABLE FOR TYMSHARE APPLICATIONS. THE TWO VERSIONS
               ARE IDENTIFIED AS PART NUMBERS 12056G1 AND 12056G2.
               THE DIFFERENCES ARE AS FOLLOWS:

               #12056G1 - SHORT LINE DRIVER/RECEIVER CAPABLE OF DRIVING
                          PRINTER UP TO A MAXIMUM OF 10FT.

               #12056G2 - LONG LINE DRIVER/RECEIVER CAPABLE OF DRIVING
                          PRINTER UP TO 500FT.

               TYPICAL TYMSHARE INSTALLATIONS ARE INVARIABLY DRIVING THE
               PRINTER IN EXCESS OF 10FT. THIS REQUIRES THAT THE I/O
               ADAPTER BOARD ALWAYS BE PART NUMBER 12056G2, TO INSURE
               ERROR FREE DATA TRANSFER.

ACTION:        PURGE ALL SPARES OF ADAPTER BOARD #12056G1 AND ATTEMPT
               TO EXCHANGE FOR #12056G2 THROUGH DATAPRINTER.
