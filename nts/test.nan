------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     All 8 ports have been brought up into the Network environment in CCITT
V.24 mode.  Channels 0-1 always have an external clock provided.  All other
channels have been brought up with both TxC and RxC provided externally, TxC
only provided externally, TxC output internally and TxC + RxC output.  
Channels 0-1 have been brought up into the Network also in the CCITT V.35
mode.  The local TTY port has been tested at the default 4800 baud and the
optional 1200 baud.

     Functional strapping of the associated H/W jumpers/switches available
for each of the channels is of course required to reflect the appropriate
selcted modes.

     Channels 2-7 have been brought up into the Network environment also in
the EIA RS-232C (ESYNC) mode at the same line speeds as under V.24 (HDLC) mode.

     All clock and data signals have been scoped during testing and found
to be comparable with existing Tymnet engine devices, the edges of the signals
showing no greater than 4% roll off at any line speed in either the HDLC or
the ESYNC mode which appears to be equal to our existing V.24 cards and
superior to Sync cards sampled.  EIA control signals have been strapped
and used for bisync handshake control and still need to tested with modems
(sync and async).

     Bandwidth utilization measurements have been performed on each individual
channel for line speeds of up to 64K for Channels 0-1 and up to 9.6 for 2-7 in
the HDLC modes.  Packet sizes = 64, 128, 256, 512 bytes with an average 
overhead of 5 to 7 bytes per packet.  For all practical purposes, any one
channel will utilize nearly 100% of the available bandwidth.  Data through-
put can be seen to become more efficient as packet sizes increase reducing
the header, control, checksum and trailer fields overhead.  This can be
plotted as a graph of a function with a limit as regards the bandwidth.  
Letting the unutilized bandwidth = a variable x, we can produce a graph
that shows that as packet size increases, x tends to zero.  Futhermore, this
function can be implicitly differentiated to express a derivative which 
reflects variances in available bandwidths.  The point of this "tangent" is
that it seems to be one of the more positive indicators of the performance
of the IOC to be able to provide such a classic and predictable graph.  The
down side of this is that the bandwidth utilization does not hold true
when all channels are operating concurrently (esp 2-7 the interrupt driven
channels) with 4 or more channels operating at 9.6K.  In fact what is seen
is that as channels start exhibiting TX underruns and/or Rx overruns a
graph of I/O performance becomes nearly too randomized to serve any purpose.
Please note that this excludes the DMA channels 0-1.  Channels 0-1 seem to
have little impact on the NON-DMA channels and conversely are effected
little by the other channels.  By further comparison a worst case single
byte packet was evaluated.  Interestingly for the single data byte transaction
the NON-DMA INT channel in HDLC mode serviced the character in and out in
an average time of 0.2163 sec compared with the DMA channel in HDLC modes
average time of 0.2030 sec (both @ 9.6K).  Also, at comparable line speeds
the NON-DMA channels as described above supported comparable throughput
rates with the DMA channels in a one on one evaluation.

     Emulated Sync testing consist to this date of any of channels 2-7
being configured for TYMSYNC and brought up in the Network, any of same
assigned to ISIS slots and brought up in pairs under intra/inter-channel
loopback testing, and of channels 2-3 assined to a UTS TIF/HIF application
and brought up via a Chameleon Protocol Simulation written by John Burroughs
from STS (similar to 3270) with and without control signal handshaking.

     X.25 and SDLC regression tests have been performed only on channels
1 (DMA) and 2 (INT).

     ASYNC testing consist only of a modified slot exerciser test under
the ISIS.  ASYNC is subject to evaluation at this time for channels 2-7.
There still are no definitive ASYNC performance benchmarks.

     Testing is being performed on one set of PICO boards of currently
NTD ECO level.  

     The focus of the testing is still on the PICO's ability to support
existing slot application software packages.  It seems reasonable to
allow NTS another week to continue evaluating the current Firmware -
Hardware - Software prior to releasing to manufacturing at which time
NTS will provide direct support to Pilot Engineering to continue their
PICO engine effort.

     An INSTALLATION/BRING-UP guide is being produced to coincide with 
the release of the PICO to Betatest (ie sometime between April 15-May1).
The guide does have an overview of the PICO and will provide both the
FEs and the CCs with the necessary details to present the package to their
users including configuration constraints.  NTS will again provide direct
support to Staging to bring-up the initial Betatest PICO engines and will
be available to all field personnel involved in the Betatest schedule.
A copy of the INSTALLATION/BRING-UP guide will also be forwarded to TTE
to assist with training.
