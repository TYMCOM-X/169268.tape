PAD INSTALLATION:

INSTALL THE PAD IN A LOCATION WHICH WILL ALLOW ENOUGH SPACE FOR COVER
REMOVAL, HANDLING OF THE BACK PANEL CONNECTORS, OPENING THE FRONT PANEL,
AND UNOBSTRUCTED AIR FLOW.

CAUTION:  BEFORE REMOVING THE EXPANSION MODULE (TOP BOARD) OR FEATUREPAK,
          MAKE SURE THAT ALL CONNECTIONS (POWER AND ASYNC/NETWORK) ARE
          DISCONNECTED FROM THE PAD.  TO AVOID POSSIBLE DAMAGE TO AN
          EXPANSION MODULE (TOP BOARD) OR FEATUREPAK CARTRIDGE, FROM
          STATIC DISCHARGE, BE SURE TO TOUCH THE PAD'S METAL ENCLOSURE
          BEFORE INSTALLING OR REMOVING A BOARD OR THE FEATUREPAK
          CARTRIDGE.  ALSO, IF THE PAD IS TO BE SHIPPED, BE SURE TO
          REMOVE THE FEATUREPAK CARTRIDGE AND SHIP IT IN AN ANTI-STATIC
          BAG, PADDED FROM IMPACT BY THE PAD.

BEFORE CONNECTING POWER TO THE PAD, OPEN THE FRONT OF THE BOX BY PULLING
GENTLY ON THE TWO UPPER CORNERS OF THE FRONT PANEL, WHICH IS HINGED AT
THE BOTTOM.  FIRST, VERIFY THAT TWO BOARDS HAVE BEEN INSTALLED IN THE
BOX, AND THAT THE NUMBERS 4, 3, 2, 1 ARE ON THE RIGHT-HAND END OF THE
FRONT OF THE LOWER BOARD (BASE MODULE), AND THE NUMBERS 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5
ARE ON THE FRONT OF THE UPPER BOARD (EXPANSION MODULE).

NEXT, REMOVE THE LID OF THE BOX BY INSERTING THE MICOM KEY INTO ONE OF
THE SLOTS ON THE SIDE OF THE BOX.  PUSH THE KEY INTO THE SLOT HORIZONTALLY
AND PRY UP ABOUT 45 DEGREES. REPEAT FOR THE OTHER 3 SLOTS, AND CAREFULLY
LIFT THE COVER VERTICALLY TO SEPARATE IT FROM THE REST OF THE BOX.

TO REMOVE THE TOP BOARD, FIRST PRY UP AND REMOVE THE 2 BLANK FILLER
PANELS IN THE BACK OF THE PAD.  VERIFY THAT THE TOP BOARD HAS A BERG
JUMPER AT POSITION E3 (NOT E1 OR E2!!!).  TO REMOVE THE TOP BOARD, PRY
UP UNDER TOP BOARD WITH THE MICOM KEY AT THE 3 STANDOFFS AT THE FRONT
OF THE BOARD AND AT THE LEFT AND RIGHT ENDS OF THE BACK OF THE BOARD
UNTIL IT IS LOOSE.  THEN, GENTLY LIFT THE BOARD OUT VERTICALLY, WHILE
DISCONNECTING THE 50-PIN CONNECTOR J1 AT THE EDGE OF THE BOARD OPPOSITE
THE POWER SUPPLY.

VERIFY THAT THE TWO RS-232 CONTROLLER CARDS (P/N=100-2764) ARE INSTALLED
ON THE LOWEST BOARD (THE BASE UNIT), NEXT TO THE PORTS AT THE BACK WHICH
ARE MARKED "COMPOSITE" AND "COMMAND PORT".

REMOVE THE FEATUREPAK (P/N=160-1608) FROM THE ANTI-STATIC BAG.  IF YOU
HAVE A BASE MODULE WITH AN UN-CONNECTED DAISY-CHAIN RIBBON CABLE END NEXT
TO THE POWER SUPPLY, THIS DOES NOT CONNECT TO ANYTHING.  JUST MAKE SURE
THAT IT IS OUT OF THE WAY WHEN YOU INSERT THE FEATUREPAK.  WITH THE
SERIAL NUMBER AND FEATUREPAK CONNECTOR FACE DOWN, CONNECTOR END TOWARDS
THE PAD, CAREFULLY SLIDE THE FEATUREPAK INTO ITS SLOT NEXT TO THE POWER
SUPPLY UNTIL IT SNAPS INTO PLACE.  REMOVAL IS THE REVERSE OF INSTALLATION.

REPLACE THE TOP BOARD BY SLIDING THE BACK ENDS DOWN THROUGH THE VERTICAL
GUIDES PUSH CONNECTOR J1 DOWN CAREFULLY UNTIL IT STOPS, AND SNAP-DOWN
THE 3 STANDOFFS AT THE FRONT OF THE MODULE.  TAKE CARE TO KEEP THE POWER
SUPPLY WIRES FROM GOING UNDERNEATH WHEN REPLACING THE TOP BOARD.

REPLACE THE TWO BLANK FILLER PANELS.  REPLACE THE COVER, WITH THE EDGE
CUTOUTS TOWARDS THE REAR OF THE PAD, BY FITTING THE 2 SLOTS ON EITHER
SIDE OF THE COVER OVER THE VERTICAL TABS ON THE SIDES OF THE BASE, AND
PUSH THE COVER DOWN UNTIL THE LOCKING TABS SNAP SHUT.

NOW, PLUG THE POWER INTO THE BACK OF THE PAD TO TURN THE PAD ON.  THE
FIRST TIME THAT A FEATUREPAK CARTRIDGE IS INSTALLED, IT MAY BE NECESSARY
TO BRING CMOS TO A KNOWN DEFAULT CONDITION.  THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY:
(1) SIMULTANEOUSLY PRESS BOTH <RESET><RESET> AND <4> ON THE TOUCH PANEL.
(2) KEEP <4> DEPRESSED AS YOU REMOVE YOUR FINGERS FROM BOTH <RESET> KEYS.
(3) WAIT APPROXIMATELY 1 SECOND AND THEN REMOVE YOUR FINGER FROM KEY <4>.

MANUALLY COLD START THE PAD BY FIRST PUSHING <SYS1> (CO WILL COME ON), 
THEN <4> (LA COMES ON), THEN BOTH <RESET><RESET> AT ONCE (ALL LEDS ON).
THIS WILL PRODUCE THE PAD RESET PATTERN.  IN THE RESET PATTERN, FIRST THE
PORT NUMBERS 1-10 ILLUMINATE.  NEXT, THE PORT NUMBERS TURN OFF AND THE
LEDS FOR AT AND RA ARE FULL ON AND CL IS FLASHING.  RA GOES OUT WHEN THE
X.25 LINK COMES UP.  COLD STARTING THE PAD RESETS THE PASSWORD TO GET
INTO THE PAD COMMAND FACILITY TO:  MX25 (IN UPPER CASE LETTERS).

TO CHECK THE VOLTAGE ON THE PAD, THERE ARE FOUR TEST POINTS ON THE UPPER
BOARD.  THESE POINTS ARE MARKED TP1(VCC), TP2(VLG), TP3(VDD), TP4(VEE).
TP2(VLG) IS THE LOGICAL GROUND POINT.  +5.0V IS MEASURED BETWEEN POINTS
TP1 AND TP2.  +12.0+-1.0V IS MEASURED BETWEEN TP3 AND TP2.  -12+-1.0V IS
MEASURED BETWEEN TP4 AND TP2.

THE ASYNC PORTS ON THE PAD CAN CONNECT ASYNCHRONOUS TERMINALS TO TYMNET
USING THE DEFAULT PROFILES, SO THAT SPECIAL CONFIGURATIONS MAY ONLY BE
NECESSARY FOR PAD USE WITH CERTAIN PRODUCTS.  THE CUSTOMER SERVICE
REPRESENTATIVE SHOULD DETERMINE SUCH REQUIREMENTS FOR CUSTOMER 
CONFIGURATIONS PRIOR TO INSTALLATION.

THE X.25 PORTS ON THE PAD MAY BE CONFIGURED USING THE TOUCH PANEL ON THE
PAD OR VIA ONE OF THE ASYNC PORTS (1-10) ON THE BACK OF THE PAD.  USING
THE TOUCH PANEL, <SYS3> <4> REFERENCES THE SYS3 PARAMETER TO ENABLE OR
DISABLE DUAL V.24 LINKS FOR THE PAD'S X.25 TRUNK CONNECTIONS.  AFTER 
PRESSING <SYS3>, PRESSING THE <4> WILL TOGGLE THE LA LED ON THE DISPLAY
ON AND OFF.  IF THE LA LED IS LIT, THE PAD IS ENABLED FOR DUAL X.25 LINKS;
IF IT IS NOT LIT, THE PAD WILL ONLY HAVE THE "COMPOSITE" PORT AVAILABLE FOR
CONNECTION TO X.25.  AFTER SETTING THE X.25 TRUNKS, PRESS <SYS4> TO
RETURN TO THE RUNNING DISPLAY, OR WAIT 25 SECONDS AND THE PAD WILL
RETURN BY ITSELF TO THE RUNNING DISPLAY.  CLOSE THE FRONT PANEL ON THE PAD.
PROCEED TO STEPS BELOW TO CONFIGURE INDIVIDUAL TRUNK CHARACTERISTICS,
BUT SKIP STEPS 5 AND 6.

TO CONFIGURE THE X.25 TRUNKS USING AN ASYNCHRONOUS TERMINAL CONNECTED TO
ONE OF THE PORTS ON THE BACK OF THE PAD, USE THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURE:

(1)  AUTOBAUD THE PAD:  <CR> . <CR> (CARRIAGE RETURN, PERIOD, CARRIAGE
     RETURN)
(2)  AFTER PAD RESPONSE, AT THE * PROMPT TYPE:  C 00/99 <CR> <CR>
     WHERE 00/99 IS THE DEFAULT ADDRESS FOR THE PAD'S COMMAND FACILITY.
(3)  AT THE PASSWORD PROMPT, TYPE:  MX25 <CR>
     MX25 (MX IN UPPER CASE) IS THE DEFAULT PASSWORD FOR ENTRY TO THE PAD.
(4)  AT THE COMMAND MENU, SELECT 1 TO GO TO CONFIGURE MENU.
(5)  AT THE CONFIGURE MENU, SELECT 17 FOR SOFT SWITCHES.
(6)  THE SOFT SWITCHES MENU IS EQUIVALENT TO SETTING THE SWITCHES USING
     THE TOUCH PANEL.  SYS1:2, SYS2:0, SYS3:8, MODEM:0  ALLOWS FOR
     EXTERNAL CLOCKING ON THE X.25 TRUNK(S) WITH SYS1=2, AND SYS3=8
     ALLOWS FOR DUAL X.25 TRUNKS (FOR SINGLE X.25 TRUNKS SYS3=0).
(7)  TO CONFIGURE THE TRUNK(S), AT THE CONFIGURE MENU, SELECT 5 FOR
     TRUNK.  IF YOU ARE CONFIGURED FOR DUAL TRUNKS, IT WILL PROMPT YOU
     FOR A TRUNK NUMBER.  TRUNK 1 IS THE PRIMARY TRUNK IN A DUAL TRUNK
     CONFIGURATION, AND THE ONLY TRUNK IN A SINGLE TRUNK CONFIGURATION.
     
     trunk  :[*]1
     primary address:[00]00
     class select:[1]
     password:[]
     in call:[0]1
     k:[7]
     t1:[5]
     n2:[10]
     t3:[15]
     w:[2]
     pktsize:[7]
     segsize:[6]

     ALL THE PRIMARY TRUNK PARAMETERS ARE THE DEFAULT VALUE IN THIS
     CASE, EXCEPT INCALL=1.  TO CONFIGURE THE SECONDARY TRUNK, ENTER 5
     FOR TRUNK AT THE CONFIGURE MENU.  TO CONFIGURE SECONDARY TRUNK:

     trunk  :[*]2
     secondary address:[***************]00
     loading factor:[0]2
     dte/dce:[0]
     clocking:[1]

     THIS CONFIGURATION GIVES THE SECONDARY TRUNK THE SAME ADDRESS AS
     THE PRIMARY TRUNK (00), ALLOWS IT TO SHARE 50% OF THE LOAD
     (loading factor=2), PAD IS DTE DEVICE (dte/dce=0), AND CLOCKING
     SOURCE FOR PAD IS EXTERNAL (clocking=1).  ENTER <CR> AT THE
     CONFIGURE MENU SELECT PROMPT AND SELECT 10 AT THE COMMAND MENU 
     PROMPT TO (WARM) RESET THE PAD AND LOGOUT.  AT THIS POINT, <CR>
     RETURNS YOU TO THE PASSWORD PROMPT TO LOG INTO THE COMMAND 
     FACILITY, OR ^P AND CLR AT THE * PROMPT CLEARS THE CIRCUIT.

FOR CONNECTION TO TYMNET:

TO CONNECT THE ASYNC PORTS ON THE PAD, FIRST VERIFY THAT YOU ARE USING
TYMNET APPROVED SHIELDED ASYNCHRONOUS CABLES.  THE CONECTIONS TO THE PAD
PORTS SHOULD HAVE THE FOLLOWING SIGNALS (+ FOR HIGH; - FOR LOW;
+- FOR BOTH):

ON ANY ASYNC PAD PORT (1..10):  RD-, CTS+, DSR+, DCD+, TC-, RC-, RI-
CONNECT TO TERMINAL LINE WITH:  TD-, RTS+, DTR+

TO CONNECT THE X.25 V.24 SYNCHRONOUS PORTS ON THE PAD, FIRST VERIFY THAT
YOU ARE USING TYMNET APPROVED SHIELDED CABLES (OR THOSE INCLUDED WITH
THE PAD).  ALWAYS CONNECT THE ADAPTER WHICH COMES WITH THE PAD TO THE
"COMMAND PORT" AND SCREW IT INTO THE PORT SO IT WILL REMAIN WITH THE PAD.
THE LABEL ON THE ADAPTER SHOULD INDICATE WHICH WAY IT SHOULD BE CONNECTED
TO THE PAD.  

CONNECT "COMPOSITE" PORT USING A STRAIGHT-THROUGH CABLE.  VERIFY SYNC
CLOCKS ON PINS 15 AND 17, DATA ON PINS 2 AND 3.  IF THE PAD IS UP AND
THE X.25 HOST CONNECTED TO THE PAD IS UP, THEN THE RA LED ON THE FRONT
PANEL DISPLAY SHOULD TURN OFF A COUPLE SECONDS AFTER CONNECTING THE LINE
TO THE "COMPOSITE" PORT.  THIS INDICATES THAT THE LINK HAS COME UP.
