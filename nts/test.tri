	    I finshed testing the CDS tri-speed's today at
	OP.I selected two from each box and tested them with
	a POS terminal and a auto-dial 1200/2400 baud modem.
	   All the data sets I tested worked at all three 
	speed's.
	   This concludes all the testing of the CDS tri-speeds
	in the OP wherehouse.
	   I have a list of where the first tri-speeds were 
	shipped.I will get this list to Randy Fergusson so he
	can start shipping out the prom's for the tri-speeds 
	in the field.I also have a list of where the tri-speeds
	are in Canada,I will let the International people
	handle the shipping.
	   Concord Data Systems wants to take us out for Lunch
	so let me know when we can all plan to get together.
