MARKETING INSTRUCTIONS FOR ORDERING APSS EQUIPMENT
AUGUST 22, 1985

As of October 1, 1984, all engines ordered requiring an SIO
daughtercard cage and associated daughtercards, should be
shipped with the new style APSS card cage and associated daughtercards.
The top assembly P/N is 570017-TAB. 570017-001 is for engines and 
570017-002 for mini engines. This assembly includes the card cage
with backplane, the slide racks for engine or mini, and the grounding
straps at a default of 4 feet. It also now includes the power supply, power
cord, control card and audio cable. NOTE: If you require a duplex or triplex
configuration, it may be necessary to adjust the lengths of the
grounding straps.

The APSS cardcage can also be used to house the Ethernet Lan Card
used in MXP. The APSS cardcage is the future standard size for 
boards now in development.
