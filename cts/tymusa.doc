         from locations around the globe.

     o   Users can easily communicate with their host  on BT 
         TYMNET without  the  administrative  burden  of  
         obtaining  an account and username  from  the  local  
         PTT.   Business travelers  need  not  worry  about 
         obtaining an account from the local PTT before their 
         visit.

     o   Service  utilizes  End-to-End  BT Tymnet (T2) protocol 
         and provides  unlimited CMT, X.PC and enhanced  
         interactive terminal support.

     o   Communication charges are billed to the host in the USA 
         by BT TYMNET.


Service Description


TYMUSA, provides quick and easy access from over 30 
International locations that are using BT Tymnet technology  
switches linked to Public BT Tymnet via a T2 link or a T2 
gateway.  The logon is the familiar BT Tymnet style logon and is 
universal from all participating locations.

The username TYMUSA, which has no password, is multi-targeted to 
Network Servers strategically  located within our International 
service centers.  Once connected to the Server, a second 'please 
log in' is issued and a second username is entered to identify 
the subscriber and complete the call to the destination host on 
BT Tymnet.  The second username is obtained from the 
organization offering the destination host services.  TYMUSA 
access is available to any BT TYMNET attached host that  
requests TYMUSA service through their BT TYMNET sales 
respresentative.  TYMUSA provides BT Tymnet's customers with the 
capability to accept reverse charge calls from their end-users  
in the participating foreign locations.  Multinational  
companies can now have all their communication costs billed to 
their office in the U.S.

This service is ideal for traveling users that need to  pre- 
program their access on diskettes in the U.S.

TYMUSA "Banded" Service


The following describes the banded access logon.  In access 
locations which are Supervised by the BT TYMNET network 
Supervisors, International Network Services (INS) uses a Menu 
Server ([ms]) as a gateway  (network server) between the 
overseas location and the BT TYMNET public network.  The network 
server provides a "please log in: " prompt for a logon which 
will identify the subscriber and complete destination routing.  
Network servers are  multibased in New York, San Francisco and 
Washington D.C.  Access from such locations is targeted to one 
of five "band" hosts on the closest server.   Each band has 
associated pricing.  Routing to the correct band host is 
automatic and based  upon the cost of providing service from any 
given location.

TYMUSA Unbanded Service


The following describes a TYMUSA logon via a T2 gateway.  The 
service is referred to as unbanded because the access does not 
pass through the banded network server hosts but is direct from 
the inter network gateway at the regular price for that 
network's service.

Accounting


The session generated with the "TYMUSA" ID is charged to BT 
TYMNET by the foreign administration.

The session from the Network Server or T2 gateway into BT Tymnet 
is processed by the BT TYMNET domestic accounting system and 
invoiced to the destination host.  The fee for the username 
(entered at the second 'please log in') and associated session 
charges are billed to the host and identified on BT TYMNET's 
billing report (exact detail varies by report format selected).


TYMLINK Features Summary

             available.

     o       TYMLINK allows users users to communicate with 
             their host on BT TYMNET without the administrative 
             burden of obtaining an account and username from  
             the local PTT. Business travelers need not worry  
             about obtaining an account from the local PTT 
             before their visit.

     o       TYMLINK offers a simple logon procedure.

     o       TYMLINK communication charges are billed to the 
             host by BT TYMNET.

     o       Applications which can operate via X.75 gateways 
             and X.28 PADs work well with TYMLINK.


TYMLINK Service Description


Where TYMUSA is not currently available, TYMLINK service may 
provide a suitable alternative.  TYMLINK has all the convenience 
of being billed in the USA,  it's just that the local access 
method varies and is slightly different from that used for 
TYMUSA.



                             - 5 -                      TYMUSA
With TYMLINK, BT Tymnet protocol (T2) does not run from 
end-to-end of the network circuit and the local interface is an 
X.28 PAD, not a BT Tymnet terminal interface (ConSat).

The user may need to use a different "awakening sequence" from 
the "a" typically used to solicit "please log in: " from a BT 
Tymnet terminal interface.  The TYMLINK prompt after sending  
the awakening sequence varies by location.  To get from the 
TYMLINK location to the TYMUSA server "please log in: " may or 
may not require the entry of a data string.
                            
Information on TYMLINK  logon  procedures  is  included  with 
the location's access information in the appropriate section 
below.

Calls from TYMLINK locations are routed to the appropriate band 
of the TYMUSA network servers.  TYMLINK service shares band 
pricing with TYMUSA.  Customers of TYMUSA are able to use 
TYMLINK in the same rate bands as their TYMUSA access allows.  
It is not possible to grant TYMLINK service for a particular  
band while barring TYMUSA access from that band and vice versa.  
To order TYMLINK, simply order TYMUSA service from your 
representative.

     -   If you experience problems with your application, it 
         may well be that reconfiguring the PAD will help.  The 
         current profile may be changed by using control-p to 
         escape to the PAD and then entering a  "SET" PAD 
         command.  For example:-

         ^pSET 1:0,5:0,6:0,12:0,13:0,15:0,20:0,21:0

         The above example changes the PAD to be transparent 
         with no local echo.

Note:    Default PAD Profile: enter "<ctrl-p>PAR?" at first '*' 
         prompt.

The current profile may be changed by using control-p  to  
escape  to the PAD and then entering a  "SET" PAD command eg:-

         ^pSET 1:0,5:0,6:0,12:0,13:0,15:0,20:0,21:0

This example changes the PAD to be transparent with no local 
echo.
