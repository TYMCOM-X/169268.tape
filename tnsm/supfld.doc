                            1 -  Staging the Supervisor







                                 1.1  Introduction


                Although functional target software is normally  provided for
      staging purposes,  due to the complex nature of the subject familiarity
      with the sysgen  process is necessary beyond  a step by  step procedure
      for  staging.  The  purpose  of this  document is  to  provide detailed
      sysgen,  startup  &  initialization  and  checkout  of  the Supervisor.
      Companion documents will provide  similar infor mation for  the various
      related processes such as  Netval, Ram, TMCS, NEM and  Network Console.
      The intended audience is the experienced Tymnet Network  Consultant who
      has participated in a Supervisor related project at least once, but who
      needs more understanding of the system and a bit of a "cookbook"  to be
      comfortable with the subject.  This document is not intended to replace
      or condense any existing Tymnet documentation, but rather to supplement
      available documentation.  Frequent references will be made to available
      documents, and the bibliography  at the end will direct  the interested
      student to additional information.

                This  document is  divided  into four  major  sections.  Each
      section  describes a  particular aspect  of the  Supervisor,  and taken
      together  they describe  the Supervisor  from basic  concepts  to final
      check out.

                The  first section  provides  an overview  of  the Supervisor
      structure, along with some general theory of operation  describing it's
      major  functions, and  the various  "slave" processes  it uses  and the
      functions they serve.

                Section two provides a functional description of  the various
      sysgen  files which  make up  the Supervisor.   These include  the disk
      allocation files for the newer 300 and 160 Mbyte disk drives as well as
      the disk and  load files for the  older 10 Mbyte disk.   The Supervisor
      Tym file for both the older  system and the newer all macro  format are
      discussed.

                Section  three describes  the major  differences  between the
      older  versions  of  the  Supervisor  and  the  new  all  macro  format
      introduced  in Version  41.  The  primary emphasis  is on  upgrading an
      existing Version 40.01 or prior system to Version 41.01.  This may seem

      to normally be outside the province of staging, but the very  first 160
      Mbyte disk staged by NSSU required just this upgrade.

                The  forth  and final  section  provides a  series  of canned
      procedures for  common and sometimes  un-common network  support tasks.
      This section  may be  viewed as a  sort of  "cookbook" for  the network
      support  consultant where  he can  turn for  "recipes" for  those tasks
      which  he has  either  not thoroughly  learned, or  has  forgotten from
      disuse.






                            1.2  The Tymnet Supervisor


                A  Tymnet technology  network  is a  centrally  directed data
      communications network.  The primary attribute of a  centrally directed
      data network is a central control program which monitors  and allocates
      the resources  of the network.   In a Tymnet  network, this  program is
      called  the Supervisor.   The Supervisor  employs a  dynamic  scheme by
      which it  keeps a  current picture  of the  network and  it's resources
      (e.g., bandwidth, nodes, ports, hosts).

                The existence of central control provides a number of natural
      advantages.  Information related to  the global picture of  the network
      is readily available, as are accounting and security information.  This
      information  enables  operational  monitoring,  and  efficient  use  of
      network resources.

                The  Supervisor provides  four  chief functions  for  the net
      work.  The most fundamental of these and the one which is  most visible
      to the end user  is the process by which  a user is assigned  a logical
      path  through  the  network  from  an  origination  point  to   an  end
      destination.   This function,  called circuit  building, provides  as a
      natural side effect a single  point in which to implement a  high level
      of network security.

                In a Tymnet technology network, Security is one of the strong
      points.   The  central control  provided  by the  Supervisor  serves to
      provide  nearly  any  level of  security  restriction  the  customer is
      willing to use, or if  desired, none at all.  Access may  be controlled
      based on  user ID and  password, origination or  destination.  Critical
      network functions such as Probe  are protected by double login  and two
      passwords, and  the Supervisor can  enforce password protection  at the
      network level above and beyond that at the destination host itself.

                Perhaps even more important to the network itself  than login
      processing  is  another  function  whereby  the  various  resources and
      topological  data  are  managed.   This  process  ensures  that control

      circuits are built to each available network node and that each node is
      in the state  called takeover, a state  whereby each node  is available
      for  use  by  the  network.   Further,  active  management  of  network
      resources such as nodes, hosts, and links is required to ensure optimum
      use of available resources.

                The  Supervisor  provides a  convenient  central  point where
      individual nodes or interfaces  may send reports of normal  or abnormal
      operation.  Each report is timestamped and filed on disk in  a circular
      first in, first out buffer  where it is stored for later  access.  Thus
      centralized data collection  and storage is another  primary Supervisor
      function.  In  addition to operational  events and error  conditions, a
      node may report accounting data.

                Where billing of end users for their use of network resources
      is required, the Supervisor provides a convenient cen tral  point where
      Accounting data  may be collected.   Detailed records of  every session
      are  generated  by each  node  in the  net  work, and  sent  at regular
      intervals to  the Supervisor where  they are stored  on disk  for later
      access.

                The fourth major function of the Supervisor  provides network
      operators  with  valuable  performance  monitoring   capability.   This
      includes such  things as  login rate,  communication delay  and various
      types of  activity reports  such as  takeover, condition  changes, etc.
      Availability of this information allows the net work operators  to take
      action when major problems such as line or node outage arise as well as
      to intelligently plan for growth.

                In  summary, the  four  major functions  of  topological data
      management,   login   processing,  data   collection   and  performance
      monitoring are provided by the Tymnet Supervisor.  These  functions are
      the same in any Tymnet technology network whether it is a 16 node small
      scale private network  or a 2500+ node  public data network.   The same
      software and  the same  hardware are  used in  both cases,  albeit with
      widely varying configurations  to accommodate the  varying requirements
      for different networks.

                The  Supervisor  memory  space is  divided  into  three major
      areas.  They are designated AREA 0, AREA 1, and AREA 2.  Each  area has
      a uniquely specialized function.

                The actual executable code  for the Supervisor is in  AREA 2.
      This area always resides  in Segment 8, beginning at  relocated address
      80000 hex.  Until Version 39, the Supervisor was less than 64k  in size
      and could  reside completely  in one  segement.  Recently  however, the
      growth of the code has caused it to over flow into segment 9 for  a mac
      page (256 bytes) or two, so  the actual top of memory for the  sup will
      be  a little  more  than 90000.   The  actual size  will  vary slightly
      depending on what options are selected at sysgen time.

                Supervisor Area 1 is  the Node Communications Area.   This is
      the area where the shared memory ring buffers for  Node Code/Supervisor
      communication are located.  This area  is much smaller than 64k  and is
      defined  by the  parameter SUPCSZ.   The  Node/Supervisor communication
      area location is defined by  the parameter SCBASE and is  always 70000.
      Do not attempt to locate the communications area in any  other segment.
      This segement will appear in the memory map as owned by the node code.

                Supervisor Area  0 is  the Data Area.   This area  is further
      subdivided into four sections, two of which are called common areas and
      two of  which are called  privileged areas.  The  first area  starts at
      logical address zero within the  slot and is a privileged area.   At an
      offset into this  area defined by the  parameter SCA10, the  RWAREA, or
      Supervisor Common  area 1 begins.   This usually is  only one  mac page
      (256 bytes) in length, and  is shared memory with Probe,  Erlog, Sysmsg
      and UN2.  This  area is used for  communication between the  slaves and
      the Supervisor.  Immediately after Common Area 1 resides Common  Area 2
      which is also shared  memory with the slaves,  but to the slaves  it is
      read only.  The Supervisor  may write and  the slave  may read  but not
      write.  This is the area where Node Descriptors, Host tables,  Bad line
      timeouts, timeouts, remove lists,  free lists, etc. are  stored.  Above
      the read only area is another privileged area which is reserved for the
      Supervisor only.  All  of these areas  comprise the shared  memory used
      for interprocess communication.

      Supervisor Disk Logical Unit                             March 28, 1986


                         1.9  Supervisor Disk Logical Unit


                The Supervisor  maintains eight logical  units on  disk which
      are  files used  for various  purposes.  Some  Logical units  perform a
      single function while others are subdivided into sub units for multiple
      functions.

                Logical unit 0  is dedicated to  the User Directory,  or MUD.
      This  is the  file  where username  profiles  are stored.   The  Mud is
      nothing more than a specialized database where a special number arrived
      at by a  process called "hashing" applied  to the username is  the key.
      Because  this  hash  is  the physical  location  on  disk,  lookups are
      extremely fast, normally a fraction of a second.

                Logical  unit  1   is  First-in  First-out   circular  buffer
      expressly for  the storage of  accounting data.  The  Supervisor places
      accounting data into the buffer  as received from the network,  and the
      network accounting process (RAM) pulls the data from the buffer, oldest
      record first.

                Logical  unit  2 is  subdivided  into many  areas  which have
      similar functions.  All are  areas whef Supervisor re  n toftwarekeepch
      inst stervisor  crash  of the Super  visor itself.  This  capability is
      rarely used, but when problems are encountered it can be invaluable.

                Logical unit 3  is subdivided into  three areas, only  one of
      which is of major concern,  the Class and Group table.  The  others are
      the  Subnet  table, which  is  not fully  implemented,  and  the target
      profile table which  is used to  allow for multi-targeting.   The Class
      and Group tables  perform a major role  in most network logins,  thus a
      more detailed discussion is warranted.






                          1.10  The Class and Group Table


                The Class table is an auxillary access control table which is
      used to define "classes" of originations (by class number).   The Group
      table similarly permits the  definition of "groups" of  destinations by
      group number.  Both of these  tables can be used to enhance  the access
      control function by defining an explicit profile of access  for various
      segments of the user population.

                The  Class and  Group tables  reside on  disk where  they are
      easily accessed as needed.   However due to their relative  small size,
      and the time required  if it were necessary to  do a disk read  on each
      the class and group table for each login processed, the Class and Group

      The Class and Group Table                                March 28, 1986


      tables are  read in  each time the  Supervisor wakes  up and  stored in
      memory.  All subsequent access to the tables occurs in memory.

                Prior to Version  41 of the  Supervisor, the Class  and Group
      tables were treated as  a single file and  defined in the .SUP  file as
      CLSSIZ and GRPSIZ.  Starting with Version 41, the tables  are logically
      seperated at sector boundries and treated as seperate files.

                The Class and Group  tables share a similar  structure.  They
      are  both  divided  into  two  seperate  sections.   The  first section
      consists of a  series of 32 bit  entries each entry being  divided into
      two 16  bit sections.   Bit 15  of each entry  is used  as a  switch to
      select between two options.  Refer to the sample Class table  below for
      clarification.  The  first column  is the  relative address  within the
      tables.  Class one is defined as "0078 8066", Class two is "00DE 0002",
      etc.  If bit 15 is a one, as in the Class one entry, the  Class defined
      is a list of exceptions,  that is, a list of unacceptable  origins.  If
      the bit  is a  zero, then  the list  is a  list of  acceptable origins.
      Similarly,  in the  group file,  if the  bit is  a one  the list  is an
      exception list of unacceptable  destinations.  The number in  the first
      section of each  entry is a relative  offset from the beginning  of the
      table where the  class or group is  described, while the number  in the
      low  15 bits  of  the second  section  is a  length  value.  Therefore,
      refering to Class one below,  the description of Class one, which  is a
      list of unacceptable origins, begins at 78 hex bytes into the table and
      is 66 bytes long.

                The second section of the Class and Group tables  consists of
      a list of hosts or nodes.  Bit 15 of the first entry  indicates whether
      the list consists of hosts  or nodes.  Mixing hosts and nodes  within a
      class or  group is not  allowed, only the  first entry is  checked, and
      each additional entry is  assumed to be the same  type.  Unfortunately,
      this is contrary to  Netval documentation which insists mixing  them is
      allowed.  This  anomoly has been  written up and  submitted to  NTD for
      correction.  It is not known  at this time whether the  correction will
      be  revised documentation  for Netval,  or a  change in  the Supervisor
      logic, but the responsible support person is advised to remain aware of
      the problem.

                The Class and Group table  may be read directly from  disk by
      using the  Utility slot.  First  log into DDT  in the Utility  slot and
      issue the disk load command with the following arguments.

          * L6000,1,0


                The command  says to  read from  Utility LU  #3, Sector  0, 1
      Block (4 sectors), and place  it at address 0 within the  Utility slot.
      Refer to either the FENCE macro  (if V. 41) or the CLSSIZ value  (if V.
      40 or before)for the length of the Class Table, and then read address 0
      for the  specified number  of bytes.   Read 100  bytes for  each sector
      specified in the FENCE Macro.  The CLSSIZ parameter will usually not be
      equal to an integral number of sectors, so use the actual value.

          * R0,300


                The  Group  table  will reside  immediately  after  the Class
      table, and can be read in a similar manner.  The sample tables attached
      below were read from  a production Supervisor in the  manner described.
      The  command  L6001,1,0 will  read  the disk  starting  with  the fifth
      sector, allowing both tables to  be read in two steps.  In  the example
      described, the group table begins  at address 0300 (start of  sector 4)
      and continues for two sectors to address 04FF.

          * R300,100          (Read the first sector of Group table)
          * L6001,1,0         (Get next block)
          * R0,100            (Read second sector)

                Logical unit 4 performs for the slaves the function performed
      by LU #2 for the  Supervisor, that is, object code storage.   The slave
      software is saved here manually  or by the LOA file software  at system
      load time.  The  slaves may then  be re loaded  from this space  as the
      need arises without recourse to Elf or Loadii.

                Logical unit 5 is a  curcular buffer like LU #1,  except that
      instead  of  containing accounting  data,  it contains  the  event log.
      Messages from the network are  stored here and may be accessed  via the
      Error Log slave or the Probe LOG command.

                Logical unit 6 is subdivided into three areas, the Shut Lines
      table, IRC rotation  table and Host down  messages.  Of these  only the
      Shut Lines table has  significance to the normal private  network.  The
      shut  lines table  is a  simple  list of  hex node  number  pairs which

      indicate links  in the  network overwhich  no traffic  is to  be built.
      Like the Class and Group table, this table is stored and  referenced in
      memory, but unlike Class and Group, it is updated once a minute and not
      just at start-up.  This table is accessed via the Probe commands ESHUT,
      LSHUT, NSHUT and RSHUT.

                Logical unit 7  is a circular buffer  like 1 and 5,  but this
      buffer is normally ignored.  It is optional and should be treated  as a
      debugging tool.  It maintains  a circular buffer of  Supervisor traffic
      for analysis in the event of a malfunction.  Due to the system overhead
      it  imposes,  it  should  not  normally  be  enabled  in  a  production
      environment.

                                2.1  The .DSC File


                In an ISIS system, the disk drive is divided into  a distinct
      number of partitions which are  referred to as Global Logical  Units or
      GLU's.  Each GLU is  defined to the system  by a statement in  the .DSC
      file.  A  single statement  will normally have  five arguments  but one
      special GLU may have a  sixth argument.  A typical GLU  definition will
      look like this:

                SGU.DEF(0A,MS,0,0043,0001)


                The first argument is  the Global Unit number in  Hex.  There
      will  normally  be consecutive  global  unit numbers  from  one  to the
      highest GLU.

                The second  argument is the  mneumonic device type,  that is,
      the type  of controller  we are asking  ISIS to  deal with.   There are
      three types of  controllers currently supported  by ISIS.  Two  are for
      disk drives and one is for tape drives.  The disk drives are designated
      DK if we are talking about the nearly obsolete 10 Megabyte disks and MS
      if referring to the newer  160 and 300 Megabyte disk drives.   The tape
      controllers are always MT.

                The  third argument  is the  device unit  number.   Since one
      controller of any of the  three types may support more than  one drive,
      this number designates the physical drive for this logical unit.

                The fourth and fifth  arguments apply only to disk  and serve
      to define the physical location on the drive and the size of  this GLU.
      The fourth argument is the start cylinder and the fifth argument is the
      size in cylinders of the GLU.  These may overlap, that is two different
      partitions may share some or  all of the same cylinders.  Care  must be
      used  to  ensure that  such  overlap does  not  occur  unles explicitly
      intended  to  do so,  else  the integrity  of  the data  stored  may be
      compromised.  A single cylinder is smallest unit of storage that can be
      so described.  It is impossible to subdivide cylinders among GLU's.

                The sixth argument,  if used, can  only be in  one definition

      statement per node, and is  used to designate a special  system logical
      unit.  If a  system logical unit  is defined, ISIS  will read it  in on
      system start up and if  this area of disk contains valid  DDT commands,
      ISIS will execute those commands at start up time exactly as if entered
      from the TTY port on the multifunction board.  This provides for one of
      two methods used to start the ISIS system from disk.  The .LOA  file is
      used  to  generate  the  text  which  is  then  placed  in  this space.
      Therefore if the system uses  a .LOA file, a system logical  unit needs
      to be defined, and if a system logical unit is defined, an .LOA file is
      expected.

                There are three different  types of disk drives which  may be
      used with ISIS, in addition to the tape drives.  Refer to Example 1 for
      a sample .DSC file for the CDC 160 Megabyte drive.

                Actually, there  are two different  disk drives which  may be
      treated as one type by the  system.  The first is the CDC MMD  drive, a
      14 inch sealed media  drive, and the second is  the CDC FSD, an  8 inch
      sealed  media drive.   Both  drives have  the same  physical  number of
      heads,  sectors,  tracks  and  cylinders,  and  thus  may   be  treated
      identically, although the FSD is physically about half the size  of the
      MMD.

                The  .DSC file  is divided  into three  sections.   The first
      section describes the physical media configuration to  ISIS.  Necessary
      information  includes  MXGLU, or  the  actual number  of  distinct disk
      partitions, actual address of  the controller, MSCDA0, or if  more than
      one  present  MSCDAx  where  x  is  the  controller  number.   The tape
      controller address is left defaulted, although it could be specified if
      need be.   The next  six parameters describe  the physical  disk media.
      Total cylinders on each drive, MSCCYx, number of tracks or platters per
      cylinder for each drive, MSCTKx, and number of sectors per  track, also
      for each drive, should they be different.

                The second section contains the GLU definitions for the node.
      GLU's are defined for all drives, and each GLU equals one partition.

                The third section is the most complex, and the most critical.
      This is where  the relationship between  the GLU's described  above and
      the various slot level  functions are established.  There is  a section
      here for each slot, and each slot logical unit references a  GLU above.
      The  same  GLU may  be  assigned to  multiple  slots, so  care  must be
      exercised to  ensure that  no such  references occur  unless specificly
      intended.   A  typical  SLOT  GLOBAL  UNIT  reference  will  have  four
      parameters and look something like this:

            SGU.REF(slot#,sgu #, glu #, license)


                The first argument, the slot number, obviously designates the
      ISIS slot which this unit is associated with. The SGU number is  a slot
      level version of the GLU number in the SGU.DEF statements  above, while

      The .DSC File                                            March 28, 1986


      the GLU number refers to  the actual physical GLU above which  this SGU
      corresponds to. License is a  combination of one or more of  Read (RD),
      Write (WR), Attach (AT) and System (SS).  Proper assignment of licenses
      will  protect data  from improper  access or  modification  by specific
      slots or processes.

                Each slot will  have zero or  more logical units  assigned to
      it.  The actual number assigned is  given as NXLUx where x is  the slot
      number. Each ISIS slot may be assigned logical units in any  order with
      two reservations.  First, by  convention, when  tape LU's  are assigned
      they normally  the lowest  SGU numbers, and  secondly, although  it may
      seem obvious, it  is necessary for the  slot slftware to have  the same
      knowledge of which LU is which.  Supervisor slot and it's slaves are an
      exception to this however.

                The Supervisor and it's slaves always expect  certain logical
      units to be attached to definate logical units.  For example, the error
      log is  always SGU.REF  5 in probe  although only  4 lu's  are defined.
      Since two SGU's are skipped over, the number of LU's given in  the NXLU
      statement must be 7, even though only 4 are actually used.  The special
      cases for the Supervisor and it's slaves are contrary to  simple logic,
      but must nevertheless be followed religiously.  Changing  parameters in
      this area is not done lightly.

                The  last slot  is  the Utility  slot, and  may  contain many
      additional  logical  units.  Although  the  admonitions  about changing
      parameters in  supervisor slaves  cannot be ignored  here, they  can be
      modified slightly.   The Utility  slot logical  units should  match the
      Supervisor  logical  units where  they  are in  common,  but additional
      logical units may  be defined.  Utility is  a general purpose LU  to LU
      copy facility.  It's processes are called upon by the Supervisor, hence
      the need to have common LU numbers with the Supervisor, but it can also
      be entered  by the operator  via DDT for  the express purpose  of doing
      such a copy.  One common use would be to back up a sealed media disk LU
      by LU to tape, or another drive, for the purpose of doing maintenance.





                  2.1.1  Tips for Supervisor DSC files

           -  Group  the  MUD/CUD,  accounting  and  error  log  global units
      together  with   MUD/CUD  in  the middle  to minimize  disk  drive head
      movement and speed   since these files are the main ones the supervisor
      works with  after   initialization.   If another  utility such  as ELF,
      RAM, or NETVAL is   also to  be on the supervisor, place its  main work
      area adjacent to the   areas mentioned above.

           - For the  160/300 mbyte drives, always  make the core  image save
      area the   first global unit on the disk.

           -  Be  sure  to  observe  the  logical  unit  number  (XLU  in the
      SGU.REF's) order   convention inside the SUPERVISOR, PROBE,  ERROR LOG,
      ACCOUNT, SYSMSG,   UN2, slot NXLU assignments. This is VERY important!.
      A future version   of the Supervisor code will allow  flexibility here,
      but for now each   important slave's internal logical unit number order
      must map to the   others. The order must be:

             XLU            AREA TYPE

              0             MUD/CUD
              1             ACCOUNTING
              2             SUPERVISOR SAVE AREA
              3             CLASS AND GROUP DEFINITIONS
              4             SOURCE/DESTINATION FILE
              5             ERROR LOG
              6             HOST MESSAGE
              7             SUPERVISOR HISTORY
              8             (RESERVED)
              9             REGIONAL DATA SET
              10            CLOSURE WORK FILE


             The XLU order inside the  UTIL slot does not have to  conform to
      this.

           - When setting up the total user space and the format area  on 160
      drives,   be sure to leave a gap of 5 cylinders unused at the end.  The
      160's will   reassign a limited number of bad tracks to the end  of the
      total area.    This  area could be  up to 5  cylinders and if  you have
      used any of these,   you run the risk of trying to use bad  tracks.  An
      example for the   SGU.DEF would be:

            SGU.DEF(#,MS,0,0000,0332)    :User Area
            SGU.DEF(#,MS,0,0000,0337)    :Format Area






                  2.1.2  RAM disk Tip's

           - If  you are installing  on one  of the sup's,  put the  RAM disk
      assignment   right next to the ACCT/MUD/ERR areas to minimize  the head
      movement of the   drive.

                  2.1.3  NETVAL disk Tip's

           -  The DISK_UNIT_ONE_SIZE  in the  NVAL pascal  configuration file
      (.A0#)   absolutely must exactly equal the same as the area  defined in
      the   .DSC file.   Do not make  the value in  the .DSC file  larger for
      growth!

           - The MUD/CUD size in the .DSC file must be greater than  or equal
      to the  DEFMUD in  the supervisor configuration  file, which  must ALSO
      agree  with  MAXIMUM_CUD_BLOCK  *  MAXIMUM_CUD_BLOCK_SIZE  in  the .AO#
      Netval file.

           - This area  should also be adjacent  to the ACCT/MUD/ERR  area if
      NETVAL   resides on a supervisor, to minimize head movement.

                The LOA File is  not, strictly speaking, a  Supervisor sysgen
      file.  Rather it is  a sysgen file for  a small section of  code called
      DINS  which  is  executed  at  node  start  up  time  which  takes  the
      responsibility  for  loading  and  starting  the  various  ISIS  slots,
      including any Sup slots.  It  supports only the Ampex 10 Mb  disk drive
      system.  MSC based disk systems are supported by the DINP program which
      does not  require an LOA  file.  It could  be used in  a non-Supervisor
      environment if desired.  When the Node code and Kernel are exeEcuted in
      an ISIS machine, one of the earliest actions executed is the  output of
      the "LOGIN" prompt to the multifunction port.  There is a  little known
      switch in ISIS which when set  will cause this output to occur,  not to
      the multi function port, but to a phantom device.  This  phantom device
      is then  read for input,  and any commands  input from this  device are
      executed just as though they had come from the multifunction port.  The
      LOA file is used to generate this phantom device and it's data,  and it

          53     ESLOTE


                Lines 2  and 3  define the  number of  blocks needed  for the
      Supervisor.  The total number of blocks between the two lines should be
      greater than or equal to the "Code Save to Disk" specified in  the Supe
      slot gen.  Since 64k is the maximum segment size, 40 hex or  64 decimal
      is the maximum you can have in one of these statements so line 2 should
      remain  constant.  Line  3 should  contain the  remainder of  the Total
      Amount less 40.  Rounding the  remainder up to be divisible by  2 seems
      to cause no problems and  may in fact be necessary.   However, rounding
      up to be divisible by 4 caused crashes for me when I tried to boot from
      disk.  The 80000 in line 2 and the 90000 in line 3 are constants as are
      the 4000 and 4040.

                Line 5 should contain  the number of blocks specified  by the
      label NPROBE#  in the  Probe slot gen.   The 8003  is the  disk address
      where the  code is  stored and the  0 is  the relocated  memory address
      where the code is loaded.

                Line 6 should contain the number of blocks specified by label
      NERLOG#  in  the  Errlog  gen.   The  Disc  Block  Address   should  be
      8003+NPROBE#.  Again the code resides at address 0.

                Lines 7, 8, and 9 follow the same format as line 6.  You need
      to  look at  NACCOUNT#, NSYSMSG#,  and NUN2#  in the  appropriate gens.
      Each  Disk Block  Address will  be calculated  by summing  the previous
      address with the previous number of blocks.

                Lines 24 and 47 are examples of Chain statements.   There can
      be up to 3 of these statements in the file.  When genning the CMD file,
      this .LOA  file is  brought in  and Sector  Totals are  calculated.  No
      Sector Total should exceed 100 bytes.  If it does and you have used all
      three  Chain statements,  you  must reconfigure  the LOA  file  or else
      reconfigure the entire node until it does.

                Lines 3,  5 through  9, 21, 33,  44, and  53 all  contain the
      ESLOTE command.  Note that in line 21 the command is ESLOT.  The ESLOTE
      message tells JRINDE to log into each slot upon initial  ization, check
      it out,  and execute  it.  The  ESLOT command  says to  log in  but not
      execute the slot.  This ESLOT can be used any time you want  to include
      code to be loaded  but do not want  the slot started up.   For example,
      BOA has backup RAM and VAL slots that are loaded this way.

                Lines 19 and 20  contain information about the  segment sizes
      of the Utility slot.  Segments 0 and 1 are always saved for Utility and
      their sizes, which are included here, are available in the Utility slot
      gen.

                Lines 28  through 44  are examples  of user  interface slots.
      The SLOTX statement specifies  the slot number and device  number where
      the code is to be stored.  In the case of most user slots which  do not

      themselves use disk or tape,  the device number is always  0.  Segments
      to be saved for each  interface are specified in the slot  command file
      at the end with statements looking like SEG#, S#SIZE;P.  All slots save
      segment 0E and then each  saves the particular segments it  needs.  All
      segments that are saved this  way must be specified in this  .LOA file.
      The sizes are available in the gens.  Note: if a segment size  is 10000
      and the next segment does  not get saved, include it anyway  as overrun
      from the previous segment.

                Lines 48 through 53  show the Ram slot.  The  only difference
      between this slot and other user slots is in the SLOTX  statement.  You
      still specify the slot number,  but in this case, the device  number is
      3.  This matches the .DSC file in which the code save logical  unit for
      this particular slot is 3.  This type of situation will  normally occur
      when tape is used by the slot, and by default is expected to be  LU's 0
      and 1.






                           2.6  The Supervisor Tym File


                The Supervisor  Tym file is  the essential sysgen  file which
      defines  the critical  parameters  of the  Supervisor.   Beginning with
      Version 41, the Tym file underwent major changes in form.  Prior  to V.
      41, the Tym file was  a rather imposing construct with  many parameters
      which  were  not  intended  to be  modified  by  field  support.  Until
      recently, the Supervisor had been largely supported and  maintained out
      of the developement group in NTD, and little thought had been  given to
      the field support  perspect ive.  Version 41  was the culmination  of a
      major attempt to change to a simpler format.

                Major changes were indeed  made in the format,  but virtually
      all the  parameters which existed  in Version 40  and before  are still
      available but have been moved "below the surface" so the  field support
      person  doesn't  have  to  be concerned  as  long  as  default  or pre-
      calculated values can serve.  The most significant change of  course is
      the introduction of  the macro format,  which allows error  checking of
      entered values much more  extensive than the simple equate  format used
      before.   For two  reasons, we  will concentrate  first upon  the older
      format before moving on to the newer format.  The first reason  is that
      the parameters and equa tions  given in the older file  are instructive
      in the lower level functioning of the software, and secondly  there are
      still many older system still to be supported.  Once the  consultant is
      familiar with the older format, the all macro format is very simple and
      easy to deal with.

                On  the next  page  is a  sample Supervisor  Tym  file, circa
      Version 40.01, with greatly expanded comments.  This file  when studied

                            2.7  General Consideration


           1.  When upgrading versions of any network code, be sure  to check
      all available sources, Baseline, etc. for any effects            to the
      Supervisor.

           2.  All slots  should be regenned, even  if they don't seem  to be
      affected and should not change.

           3.  All gens need to be saved.

           4.  After .LOA, .DSC, and .SUP files have been changed,  all slots
      which access them  absolutely must be regenned.   Again,           keep
      the gens for the necessary cross-referencing.

           5.  Before loading, ascertain  whether any disk LU's  have changed
      size or location on the physical platter.  If so, then            it is
      necessary to format the  platter before loading.            If  using a
      10 MB drive, this may be done from SCP/UTIL,      otherwise it  will be
      necessary to load the disk           maintenance program.

      General Consideration                                    March 28, 1986


           6.  On  occasion it will  be necessary to  format the  entire disk
      system.  Again, this can be done through the utility            slot in
      the case of  the 10 Mb systems  or with the  disk           maintenance
      program.   If  this is  done,  it will  be            necessary  to re-
      initialize the  cud.  If  the network           uses  Val then  this is
      done by logging into the  VAL slot           in DDT and doing  a ?stat.
      It will  ask something about            whether you want  to initialize
      the cud.  Say  Y.  When           done, the  username Netpriv;privilege
      will have  been            validated.  At this  point you can  log into
      Netpriv and           restore the  system from tape.  If the  system is
      using           Netval, an  entirely different procedure using  the Net
      val Disk Maintaince program is required.  Please refer           to the
      Netval  documentation  for  the version  in  use  for           further
      information.

           7.  All supes will need to  be loaded and tested in a  lab environ
      ment before being installed at the customer's site.

           8.  Testing  should at  least include logging  into each  slot via
      DDT to check for  error messages and booting from  disk.            The
      supe should come awake by itself and if running            alone should
      awaken by itself after being put to sleep.

      The Macro Supervisor                                     March 28, 1986






                             3 -  The Macro Supervisor


                Perhaps  the  single  most difficult  part  of  configuring a
      completely new  Supervisor has always  been configuring  the Supervisor
      TYM file.  This was for a  couple of reasons, first the file  itself is
      very  complex,  and  contains  a number  of  parameters  which  are not
      intended to be changed by  the consultant.  Further, in many  places it
      contains actual  code which is  not explained, thus  lending additional
      confusion to the support person who has to deal with it.   Referring to
      the Version 40.01  sample Tym file above,  the ISIT switches and  the Q
      Macro are examples  of this.  The Supervisor  TYM file justly  became a
      target  of  criticism  and  a  determined  effort  has  been   made  to
      restructure and simplify the Supervisor generation procedure.  Ideally,
      the Supervisor TYM file would consist of one Macro in a  format similar
      to this:

           SUPERVISOR(number, size)
                number = Supervisor Number, 1-7
                size   = network size, small, medium or large
                          or alternately, the number of nodes.


           All other macros and  parameters should be optional  with defaults
      chosen so as to intelligently reflect differing size selections.

                Unfortunately, this  ideal has not  been quite  met, although
      even the most cynical observer must agree that the new format  is quite
      an  improvement.   But   beyond  simplifying  the  file   and  removing
      extraneous  text, the  new  format embodies  an  important enhancement,
      improved error checking for entries.  Consider the Q macro  referred to
      in the 40.01 file.  This defines precisely the elements 'A1',  'A2' and
      'A3' so that if the arguments are not reasonable values, a sysgen error
      will result.  If we place the Q macro itself in an initialization file,
      then  we  can  specify the  statement  Q(CONTROL,364BEBF6,$837)  in the
      Supervisor Tym file  and know that if  the values are not  correct then
      Nad will  reject it.  by  contrast, specifying a  value by means  of an
      'EQ' statement  will not  easily allow such  error checking.   Nad will
      blithely allow anything to be defined as equal to almost anything else,
      and this can create some strange problems, thus the emphasis on the use
      of Macros for all newer software coming out of NTD.

                It is  not the  purpose of this  article to  provide in-depth
      sysgen information about genning the Supervisor in the new format as an
      excellent manual (SUPGEN.DOC) already exists for that purpose.  Rather,
      the purpose  here is  to illustrate  the major  changes from  the older
      Supervisor, and provide some guidance for upgrading the earlier system.

      The Macro Supervisor                                     March 28, 1986


                Much has been retained from before, with only  minor changes.
      Comparing the example below with the Version 40.01 sample given before,
      we see the similar remark statement which nicely prints  the customer's
      name on the hardcopy output from the assembly.  The next macro, TYMSTR,
      is simply a macro equivalent  for the SUPERN equate.  The  OPTION macro
      is a convenient grouping for  some of the common switches in  the older
      Tym file.  The  Equates replaced are  MSC,ISIS,T1GOUG,NORATE,NOPERF and
      OPCIPH.   A  new option,  NOSPAS,  prevents normal  user  circuits from
      passing  through  the  Supervisor  base  node  while  allowing  command
      circuits.  The ISIS option NPTHR prohibits all circuits, an undesirable
      choice as employing it  will result in a  one node network as  the base
      refuses to allow the Supervisor access to the other  nodes.  Similarly,
      the DEFTIM macro  is a convenient grouping  of all the  equates located
      under  the  'TIME CONSTANTS'  heading  before.  The  macros  DEFNOD and
      DEFHST define the numbers of nodes and hosts in the network.

                The Macro  Supervisor Tym  file consists  of two  parts.  The
      first  section contains  parameters needed  only by  the  Supervisor or
      slaves.  The  second section contains  parameters which are  related to
      machine resource allocation, such as memory page allocations or control
      ports.  These parameters will need to be examined by ISIS and Node code
      at assembly time.  As you  can readily see, these are  merely different
      renditions of the  various parameters residing  in the older  Tym file.
      Many of  these Macros  are not required,  or if  required can  be given
      without  any  arguments, and  allowed  to default.   By  only expressly
      listing the required items, the Supervisor Tym file can be  kept simple
      appearing despite the overall complexity of the system.

                Although Supervisors version 41 and above are very similar in
      many  respects  the the  earlier  versions, there  are  occasions where
      significant differances arise to complicate things.  Com pare the Fence
      Macro  to the  CLSSIZ and  GRPSIZ values  in Version  40.01.   Prior to
      Version 41,  these files were  treated as  a single file  in LU  #3 and
      spanned  sector  boundries.   Beginning  with  Version  41,   they  are
      separated and treated as  two unrelated files, although  still residing
      in LU #3.   The impact of this  is that now each  table must be  one or
      more whole sectors.  Upgrading  an older file will require  the platter
      containing  LU  #3 to  be  formatted  and the  class  and  group tables
      rebuilt.  Changes may also be required in the Validations  program, and
      of course, the Sysmsg and UN2 slave must be updated as well.

                Although  Version 41  and above  of the  Supervisor  does not
      expressly  require the  160 or  300 meg  disk drive,  it  is frequently
      required to  upgrade the  hardware at  the same  time as  upgrading the
      Supervisor version.  The  300 and 160  Mb drives are  treated logically
      very much like the 10 Mb drive, the major difference being the physical
      size of the cylinders  involved.  Since the smallest logical  unit that
      can be  allocated is  one cylinder, you  will often  find that  you are
      forced to allocate larger than necessary numbers of sectors to  a given
      logical unit.   This normally  causes no  harm, and  in fact  will make
      implementing future versions of software easier as there will  often be
      no need to reconfigure the  disk to allocate more space.   For example,
      on the  10 Mb  drive example  given above,  the Sup  LU #3  requires 11
      decimal cylinders which is  528 sectors (11 *  48) while on the  300 Mb
      drive  1  Cyl =  1007  sectors,  seeming to  waste  479  sectors.  This
      apparent waste is  of no consequence as  the 300 Mb drive  provides far
      more space than can be intelligently used in any case.  It is important
      to  remember  to allocate  space  in  terms of  the  minimum  number of
      cylinders needed for a required number of sectors.

      Formatting a Disk - 10 Mb only                           March 28, 1986


                        4.2  Formatting a Disk - 10 Mb only


                Format.Nib is a disk  formatting program which simply  does a
      brute force format of the platter.  Because of the way in which this is
      done it is  a slow and time  consuming process.  This program  makes no
      attempt to re-assign defective  cylinders in the event of  errors, thus
      it becomes necessary to  run the companion program  "DSKINI.NIB" should
      any problems arise.  DSKINI  cannot run on a MAC-II  machine, rendering
      it incompatible with todays environment.  Additionally, Format does not
      support  any  MSC  disk  drives.  For  these  reasons,  the  newer disk
      diagnostic "DISK03.NIB" should be used instead of Format.  However, due
      to the number of older systems installed and the slight  possibility of
      needing to use it, the procedure is presented here.

              1. Boot node

              2. Be sure disk drive is not write protected

              3. Move format switch to right

              4. Using loadii, load format.nib

              5. Loadii will ask questions about a restart 
                       address, go for manual restart (-1).
       
              6. When loaded, unlock console and enter [DTA] then
                       3000 for device C6 (removable disk 0)
                       2900 for device C7 (fixed disk 0)
                       2800 for device D6 (removable disk 1)
                       or
                       2700 for device D7 (fixed disk 1)
                 depending on device to be formatted.  Then [ADR]
                 [RUN]

              7. When done the console should show: 0 D15C 00xx 
                       with xx being the device formatted







                         4.3  Establishing the initial MUD


                After  initializing the  CUD  through VAL,  the  username Net
      priv; Privilege  is now valid.   When using Netval,  the ADC  user name
      must be  used.  Log in  with the appropiate  username and  validate the
      following lists of names.

                Any password for DLOAD and GATEWAY is OK, but they  must have
      the same password.  This password  is used later with the G  command in
      LOADII.

           You may want to validate any other names included in the Kernel or
      Node Code goodgy lists

           Don't overlook  the need  to change the  password to  NETPRIV from
      it's default to a new password  which will only be known by  the System
      Administrator of  the network.  This  is highly important  for security
      reasons.

           You may  wish to perform  a manual consistency  after establishing
      this initial list of names.  Although Netval will  automatically update
      the MUD of any Supervisors in the network, a manual consistency has not
      only the advantage of speed, but should there be any problems  with the
      UN2 slave or Netval itself which prevent updating the MUD, they will be
      obvious.

      Booting the Supervisor from 10 Mb Disk drive             March 28, 1986


                 4.6  Booting the Supervisor from 10 Mb Disk drive


                The  Supervisor must  be test  booted from  disk  after being
      loaded for the first time to ensure that the software generated  by the
      LOA  file  functions  properly and  all  slots  are  fully operational.
      Further, after maintaince has  been performed or after a  power failure
      or system crash which  leaves the system non-functional  or functioning
      improperly, the re-boot procedure  should be used instead  of reloading
      from Elf or Loadii.  The step by step procedure below will successfully
      re-boot the normally healthy system.

                1. Unlock console

                2. Clear memory by entering [PSW] [DTA] [WRT] [INC] 
                     [RPT] and waiting until the leftmost digit of the 
                     console cycles past F, or about 10 seconds.

                3. Flip watchdog timer to place node in Boot.

                4. Enter [PSW] and wait for console to freeze

                5. enter [DTA] [SET] 66 [ADR] [RUN]

                6. Wait for C0DE 800E to appear on console

                7. Enter [INI] and wait for node to come up


                Failure of a normally  stable node to re-boot can  usually be
      traced to hardware failure, disk head crash, or similar  problems.  The
      error code displayed in step 6  above is an often valuable clue  to the
      failure.  Complete description  of the codes can  be found in  the Boot
      Documentation   "LBOOT.DOC"   maintained  on   most   Tymnet  PDP-10's.
      Successful display  of CODE  800E and  then failure  to run  most often
      indicates  the node's  software  was not  saved properly  on  disk, and
      obviously was not tested by re-booting after the initial load.  Careful
      examination of the  LOA file and slot  segment sizes should  reveal the
      problem.  Still, it is possible that the hardware could fail in  such a
      way  that the  node  could boot  and  fail to  run,  although unlikely.
      Should an  LOA file problem  not be found,  in depth  diagnostics would
      then be in order.

                The  Supervisor must  be test  booted from  disk  after being
      loaded for the first time to ensure that the software generated  by the
      save  to  disk  system  functions  properly  and  all  slots  are fully
      operational.  Further, after maintaince  has been performed or  after a
      power failure or system crash which leaves the system non-functional or
      functioning improperly, the re-boot procedure should be used instead of
      reloading from Elf  or Loadii.  The step  by step procedure  below will
      successfully re-boot the normally healthy system.  Particular attention
      should be paid to the Utility Slot after re-boot.

      Loading a Slave Slot from Disk                           March 28, 1986


                        4.8  Loading a Slave Slot from Disk


                At times it may be necessary to load one of  the Supervisor's
      Slave slots from disk.  This is certainly not an everyday need,  and in
      fact one  which would often  be best refered  to higher  support levels
      within HQTech or NTD.  Nevertheless, given sufficient expertise  on the
      part of the  Consultant, this procedure  may prove useful.   Execute as
      follows:

              1. Through DDT, log into the slot you wish to load

              2. Freeze the slot with ?FREZ

              3. Get the SUPSEG parameter from the .LOA file that
                      corresponds to that slot.  
                      Example: SUPSEG(802A,1,0)

              4. Load the slot using the disk address provided here.
                      Example: L 802A,1,0

              5. Thaw the slot with ?THAW


                This is a specialized troubleshooting and  recovery procedure
      and should not  be used as  general practice or  merely as a  matter of
      course.  It is far better  to reload the entire machine  when possible,
      and avoid possible complications or errors resulting from  typo's, etc.
      Most important, it should never be attempted on an active Supervisor.






                   4.9  Initializing the Accounting Logical Unit


                The Accounting buffer on the disk should be  initialized when
      a  Supervisor  engine  is first installed and whenever  the  disk drive
      or  it's  platters  are  replaced.    It  should  not    be initialized
      during  normal maintenance  as  uncollected  accounting  data   will be
      lost.    Failure to  initialize  can result  in the  Sup  "picking  up"
      eroneous  data  and  reporting  false   accounting information.

                The Supervisor must be frozen for this procedure.   Connect a
      terminal   to  the  Multifunction  port and  log into  probe  with  the
      RPROBE username as follows:

      Checking for Disk Integrity after Formatting             March 28, 1986


                4.11  Checking for Disk Integrity after Formatting


                The  Supervisor and it's slaves absolutely require  that  the
      disk  be filled with '00's by the formatting program.    Sometimes this
      is  not  done due  to  human carelessness  or  inexperience   using the
      format utility.   Strange problems can occur if a Supervisor is allowed
      to  return  to  production  with  garbage  or  test   patterns  on  the
      platter.   Here are  a couple of quick  checks which  will  verify that
      the platter is acceptable in this context.

                Immediately  after  loading the Supervisor  node,   log  into
      PROBE.   The Multifunction port provides an easy method to  access this
      function,  but assuming the  Supervisor is part of an   active network,
      normal network login can be used as well.

          LOGON:  PROBE    (Note:   Use only uppercase letters.)
          Slot 07
          *G C              (Enter Probe)

          NAME: CONTROL

          LOGON:


                If  the response to LSHUT is nothing then at least  the  line
      shut table on  disk is filled with  zero's.   Another quick test  is to
      use  LIST.   Only valid  names should  be  reported.    Garbage present
      indicated trouble.






                    4.12  Loading the Supervisor Slot from Disk


                This is a specialized troubleshooting and  recovery procedure
      and should not  be used as  general practice or  merely as a  matter of
      course.  It is far better  to reload the entire machine  when possible,
      and avoid possible complications or errors resulting from  typo's, etc.
      Most important, it should never be attempted on an active Supervisor.

           Again, we will use the  SUPSEG statements from the .LOA  file.  In
      the case of the Supervisor, they may be:

              SUPSEG(4040,2,90000)

            Perform the following steps:

              1. Through DDT, log into the Supe slot

              2. ?FREZ will freeze the Supe

                Careful  testing of  the  Supervisor before  returning  it to
      production is very important.   Even afterward, it should  be carefully
      monitored for several hours.






                          4.13  Superclock Initialization


                The Superclock is a board which resides in the  Supervisor to
      provide  an  accurate and  stable  time source  for  network processes.
      Normally, the Superclock is calibrated at time of manufacture and as it
      contains a  battery which  has an expected  life of  in excess  of five
      years, it should  not need attention.   However, as you  might suspect,
      the need to calibrate a Superclock will likely present itself from time
      to time.   In particular, after  maintenance or hardware  failures, and
      especially  upon  initial  installation  of  the   network,  Superclock
      calibration should be checked and performed if necessary.

                1.   First and most important, you will need a known accurate
      time  source.   Ideally  a quality  digital  timepiece  which  has been
      carefully synchronised to the National Bureau of Standards  WWV station
      in Colorado.   Next best is  to set to  a major national  television or
      radio network.   Local tv and  radio stations, as  well as  local phone
      company time service should be avoided if possible.

                example below:

          TIME = Display time as known by the Supervisor
          RTIME= Display time as known by the Superclock

                 purpose of running the diagnostics.  The node will 
                 not be running as a Supervisor at this point.

          1.  Connect clock jumpers to sync port 0     
          2.  Clear memory using procedure outlined in boot from 
              disk procedures
          3.  Flip Watchdog timer
          4.  Ascertain that the TYM file of the test code is 
              reasonable for the hardware configuration under test.  
              If not, modify code to match.

              "ISISTECH" to logon
          2.  Enter slot 0 and verify network sync lines are up 
              and functioning
          3.  Transfer into remaining sync test slots and test all 
              sync ports for a minimum of 30 minutes per port
          4.  Transfer into SLASYNC slots and start testing of all 
              assigned async ports for a minimum of 24 hrs per 
              group of 16
          5.  Verify that no errors have occurred at the end of 
              the test period

        F.   SIO/V.24 SYNC/ASYNC & OCL test:

          1.  Transfer into each applicable SIO test slot and test

              board is set to that normal position
          4.  Turn the front console key to the off position
          5.  Disconnect the AC power cord from the battery backup unit
          6.  Wait 1-3 minutes, turn the front console key to the 
              on position
          7.  Check to ensure that memory has been retained 
              (code still runs)
          8.  Verify that Battery backup unit has had full 24 hour 
              charge time
          9   Turn front console key to the off position for 2 hours 
              precisely
         10.  At completion of allotted time, turn front console key 
              to the on position and verify that memory has been 
              retained
         11.  Reconnect the AC power cord to the battery backup

                   4.15  Initial Installation of the Supervisor


           The initial installation of software in the Supervisor node 
      presents a few problems different from merely upgrading an 
      existing machine.  First, we have a machine which has never run 
      Supervisor software, and we have software which has never been 
      run in a machine.  The combination presents a large number of 
      variables should problems arise. Further more none of the disk
	logical units have been initialized.  This can present some
      unusual problems should the disk not be properly formatted.  Here 
      are some guidelines which will help ensure that a virgin 
      Supervisor starts up with minimum problems.

           When first bringing up a virgin system, a neighbor node from 
      which to load is obviously required.  However, if this is a 
      virgin system, there are no nodes or gateways from which to load.  
      It becomes necessary to "bootstrap" the Supervisor by loading 
      from a node connected to another network.  This "host" network 
      can be any network, but in practice will usually be Bubb-net or 
      the Public net.  When performing this action, risk of a Supervisor 
      Fight with significant impact upon the host network is very real.

      Initial Installation of the Supervisor                   March 28, 1986


      Precautions must be taken to prevent such an occurance.

           Here then, are some guidelines for bringing up that initial 
      system with minimum problems.

      Initial Installation of the Supervisor                   March 28, 1986



           1.   Verify the Engine passes all standard diagnostics.
                CPU, Mac, Memory, Sync/Async, Sio

           2.   Verify the peripherals pass their respective 
              diagnostics  MAGTAP, DISK, MSCTST

           3.   Verify the disk is properly formatted.
                Platter should be all '00's and not 'BD's

           4.   Verify the hardware configuration matches the software.
                Ascertain that all boards and peripherals are connected.

           5.   If a known stable Lab Engine of the proper 
                configuration is available, it would be wise to check 
                the software on known good hardware before proceeding.  
                Due to time and resource constraints, this may not be 
                practical.

           6.   Clear Engine memory ([DTA], [WRT], [INC], [RPT] 
                for 10 sec.)

           7.   Connect a temporarily unused network line from a Public 
                net or Bubb-net node to an unconfigured port on the
                new machine. This is to ensure that the link cannot
                come up after the load as our Supervisor node code
                will not know about it.

           8.   Log into Probe on the host network (Public net or
                Bubbnet) and enter a shut with the node we are 
                loading from and the new Supervisor node as the
                argument. E.G.  ESHUT 2154 2003. This is a little
                extra insurance against a disastrous Supervisor
                fight with the host network.

           9.   If possible, the new Supervisor should have it's
                host net neighbour listed in a NOTAKE statement in
                the Supervisor TYM file. This provides further
                insurance againstt a Supervisor fight.

           10.  Load the Supervisor node using LOADII, or possibly
                ELF. Remove the connection to the host network
                IMMEDIATELY upon completion of the load.

           11.  Connect a hardcopy terminal to the Multifunction port 
                and logon to DDT with a valid good guy name.  ISISTECH 
                is usually used.  At the slot prompt enter an 
                exclamation point "!" to enter the Kernel.

           12.  Enter "?WHO" and note who has logged into any slots.  
                If using a 10 Mb disk system with an LOA file, you 
                should see the username "JRINDE" entered into each slot 
                defined in the LOA file.  Presence of "no one" in the

      Initial Installation of the Supervisor                   March 28, 1986


                list may mean an error in the LOA file.

           13.  If using a 300 Mb or 160 Mb drive without an LOA file, 
                all slots should have "no one" as the previous logon.

           14.  From the terminal, Log into the Supervisor slot.  DDT 
                may report something like "not loaded" on entering the 
                slot.  If so, ignore the report.  Enter "?FREZ" to 
                freeze the Supervisor.

           15.  Move to the Probe slot.  Enter "G C" to enter Probe 
                itself.  At the probe prompt, enter "INITA" to 
                initialize the accounting buffer.  This will take a few 
                minutes.  When the prompt returns, enter "INITL" to 
                initialize the Error log.  This will also take a few 
                minutes.  Log off from Probe.

           16.  Log back into the Supervisor slot and enter "?THAW" the 
                thaw out the Supervisor.

           17.  Wait approximately 5-10 minutes, and then observe the 
                front panel.  The fifth digit should be cycling "0" & 
                "4" to indicate a sleeping Supervisor, or even "0" & 
                "5" to indicate an active Supervisor.  If still showing 
                "0" & "3" it may mean there is a problem with Supervi
                sor initialization.  This is suspect will be 
                the software unless previously tested in a lab environ
                ment.

           18.  If all is well at this point, then from the 
                Multifunction port log into each application slot and 
                verify that it is running properly and not crashed, 
                etc.  Finally, log into the Utility Slot and enter "G 
                10000" to activate SCP/UTIL.  Execute a few commands to 
                verify proper operation.

           19.  In order to verify that the software has been properly 
                stored on disk, it is necessary to reload the machine 
                with the object file(s) on disk and repeat steps 11-18 
                except for 14, 15 and 16.  It is not necessary to re-
                initialize the accounting and log files.

                19a. Hit [PSW] to halt the processor

                19b. Clear memory ([DTA], [WRT], [INC], [RPT] for 10 
                     seconds)

                19c. Flip watchdog timer to place node in boot.

                19d. Boot node from disk using the correct procedure 
                     for the type of disk in use.

                19e. Perform steps 11, 12, 13, 17, 18 above to verify

                     proper operation.  Pay particular attention to the 
                     last ISIS slot and the SCP/UTIL functions in the 
                     Utility slot. (Step 18)

           20.  Log into Probe again and try a few commands to verify 
                proper operation.  Finally, if it hasn't already 
                awakened by itself, then awaken the Supervisor and 
                allow it to take over any nodes connected to it.  
                Normally only itself will be available at this point.

           21.  Using a known accurate time source, verify the proper 
                time.  See the procedure for initializing the 
                Superclock for more details.

           22.  If all is well, we should have a fully operational 
                Supervisor, although one which does not have any MUD 
                files installed.  It is now time to proceed to the 
                VAL or NETVAL installation.
