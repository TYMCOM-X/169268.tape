         E4-E5  [AYSYNCHRONOUS CHANNEL BAUD RATE SELECT]

             Channels 10 - 13 are  divided into two pairs of  channels driven
             by a Z80-SIO/2 controller with a T609 custom SIO support device.
             Channels 10 - 13 are configured for RS232C operation.  Baud rate
             timing is provided by a 14411 baud rate generator.  Each pair of
             async channels  may be  strapped for one  of the  available baud
             rates by terminating  the asynchronous BR  bus with a  jumper to
             one of the outputs of  the 14411.  The output of the  jumper pad
             for E4 is tied to both the transmit and receive clock  inputs of
             the Z80-SIO/2 driving channels 10 - 11(location 4A).  The output
             of  the jumper  pad for  E5  is tied  to both  the  transmit and
             receive clock inputs of the Z80-SIO/2 driving channels 12 - 13.

       
              NOTE: Channel 10 baud rate will always EQUAL channel 11.
                    Channel 12 baud rate will always EQUAL channel 13.

         E6  [BAUD RATE MULTIPLIER]

             On  board timing  is available  for the  Z80-SIO/2 and  the T609
             support devices  for I/O data  timing if required.   A 1.8432MHz
             crystal  oscillator  drives  a  14411  baud  rate  generator (at
             location  2W).   The  14411  divides  the  oscillator  frequency
             providing seven  continuous frequencies output  on the  BR (baud
             rate) bus  (signals BR1, BR2,  BR3,...  BR7).  The  frequency of
             the  baud rate  generater can  be multiplied  by one  of several
             values by strapping the jumper pad at E6.  Each SYNC/SIO channel
             has a 74151 data selector in parallel to lines BR1 -  BR7.  Each
             data  selector  has its  three  input select  pins  tied  to the
             outputs of  rotary switches.   Switch settings 1  - 7  are valid
             settings.  0, 8, and 9 are unused.

             D open.


         E7  [4MHz/8MHz 2XS CLOCK]

             The primary source of all timing signals on the I/O board is the
             8.064MHz crystal oscillator  (location Y1).  The 8MHz  signal is
             divided by  2 at location  7A (7474) to  produce the  4MHz CLOCK
             signal  and  its  complement  ECLOCK.   A  third  timing  signal
             (2XSCLOCK) is derived from the buffered 8MHz signal by jumpering
             E7 A to B or the buffered 4MHz signal CLOCK by jumpering E7 B to
             C.  2XSCLOCK is further  divided through a 74163  synchronous 4-
             bit counter (location  9N) to produce  the logic timing  for the
             Z80 controllers  and the T609  support devices.  Normally  E7 is
             jumpered from B to C.


         SW1-SW10  [BAUD RATE SELECT SWITCHES]

             The 10 rotary  switches on the board  are the switches  with the
             outputs tied  to the 74151  multiplexers for selecting  the baud
             rates  for  channels  0  -  9  I/O  data  timing.    Unlike  the
             asynchronous channels 10 -  13 whose baud rates are  selected in
             pairs,  each  SIO/SYNC  channel   (channels  A  or  B)   may  be
             individually selected.  I/O  data timing may either  be provided
             externally (from modems, clock drivers or a neighboring machine)
             or  internally utilizing  the on-board  clocks. If  the on-board
             clocks are to be used one of the seven possible frequencies must
             be selected for the channel by adjusting the  appropriate rotary
             switch.


         SW11-SW20  [INTERNAL/EXTERNAL CLOCK SELECT]

             The 10  switches on  the transmit and  receive lines  (TCA, TCB,
             RCA, RCB) select the  on-board clocks or external  clock sources
             for each channel.   When any of  these switches are  thrown "ON"
             (closed)  towards the  rear panel  of the  HDLC  Microengine the
             timing provided by  the board's BR  bus will be  utilized.  When
             the switches  are thrown  "OFF" (open)  external clocks  will be
             required.  In either case  both the transmit and  receive clocks

             should be turned "OFF" until such time as they may be required.

             As this is  a microcode driven  I/O processor all  data transmit
             and receive operations are controlled by the routines  stored in
             the PROMs.  Control signals  IORQ, RD/WT, C/D and  STATUS evoked
             by the  firmware and tied  to the Z80-SIO/2s  and the  T609s are
             used to handle all data transfers.  All flagging, required modem
             signalling and modem status monitoring signalling is  handled by
             the Z80s.  Serial data out and modem control signals  are output
             from the Z80s  to 1488 line driver  inputs and the  1488s output
             the  RS-232C  signals  (NRZ)  to  the  external  I/O connectors.
             Receive  data and  modem signals  are received  on the  same I/O
             external connectors and input to the T609 support  devices.  The
             serial data received is converted to parallel and clocked to the
             input sector over the bidirectional, tri-state S0 - S7 (SIO) bus
