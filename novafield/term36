     STRAPPING FOR 9600 BAUD ASYNC DIAL-UP ANSWER MODE (TYMNET SITE)
     ---------------------------------------------------------------

1) Set the switches on the back of the modem to the following settings.

	SWA-2	ON
	SWB-1	ON


2) RESET the modem Via the front panel by pressing the LEASED and
   the LOOP 2 button at the same for at least 2 seconds.
   Connect a 9600 baud terminal to the DTE port to program the soft-
   straps.
   With the modem powered up press the return key twice.
   At the  "MODEM >" prompt type RESET. The modem will ask
   "ARE YOU SURE ? [Y OR N]. Type a Y.
   This will reset the modem to the factory default settings if the
   front panel RESET didn't work.
   (NOTE) Only REV 5.0 modems will RESET via front panel. To check
   to modems rev level , at the MODEM> prompt type RSF, the rev level
   will apear on the top line of the RSF screen.


Enter the following commands at the prompt terminating each command with
a carriage return.
>>>REV 5 <<<

   SLCD4
   SPF1
   SBK3
   SMF0
   SAS4

At the MODEM > prompt enter SRM2. After you enter the carraige return you
will not see any response. Type "SAVE" return, and "INIT" and return.
This will disable sending the Concord banner to the consat.
Type RSF and return and check to make sure the softstraps are set
correctely. SRM0 will give you the echo back.

   You are now finished strapping the modem. Connect the engine's SIO ASYNC
port to the DTE port on the modem. Be sure the baud rate of the SIO port is
set for 9600. Connect the dial-up phone line to the DIAL jack on the back of
the modem and power on the modem if it is not already. Check for DTR on
the front of the modem.

  You will not see any response after you type the SRM2 strap.
  Check your straps with the RSF<cr> command.

4) Hook the SIO Async cable to the RS-232 port of the modem.
   TYMNET SIDE:
   Press the LEASED button so the LED is ON. Press the ORIG
   button so the LED is OFF. Press the Loop2 button for at
   least 2 seconds to save the front panel settings.	

   CUSTOMER SIDE:
   Press the LEASED button so the LED is ON. Press the ORIG
   button so the LED is ON. Press the Loop2 button for at

Tymnet SIO cable will need to be modified at the Tymnet side to the
following pin out:

To Tymnet Engine SIO<---- 5|
		     \--- 6|----->5 modem port
		      \-- 8|	

	Pins 5,6 and 8 are tied together going to the Tymnet Engine, pin
	5 is sent throught to pin 5 on the modem. Remove pins 6 and 8
        on the modem side of the cable.

    9600 and 4800 baud Sync mode using a 4-wire or 2-wire Leased Line
    =================================================================

			With Manual Dial Back-up
			========================

1) Turn the modem OFF . Set the Rear panel switches to the following
   settings:
	SWA-2  ON	(9600 baud)
	-or-
	SWA-2 and 3 ON	(4800 baud)

	SWB-3  ON       (2-wire leased line)
	SWB-3  OFF      (four-wire leased line)

	SWB-1  ON  (RS-232 signal follow DCD on connect)
	SWB-4  ON  (OFF if customer is using RJ45 type Jack)

2) Power up the modem.
   RESET the modem via the front panel by pressing the LEASED and
   the LOOP 2 button at the same time for more than 2 seconds.
   Hook a terminal to the RS-232 . Wake up the modem with two
   carriage returns. At the Modem prompt type  RESET. When the modem
   responds with "are you sure?" type "Y" and return. To check the
   modem for REV 5.0 code type RSF at the MODEM> prompt.

   Enter the following softstraps at the MODEM> prompt:

	 SPB4800  (This sets the port speed to 4800 when SWA 2 and 3 is
		   set for 4800. Once you set this strap you must set your
		   Terminal speed to 4800 baud)

	 SLCD0
	 STI000
	 SXLP000	
	 SAVE
	 INIT

	If a tail circuit is needed both modems will be set to the
	following setting:

	 SST3  ORIGINATE MODEM
	      (EXTERNAL TIMING CLOCKS ON PINS 15 AND 17 BECOME IDENTICAL
	       TO THE CLOCK ON PIN 24 FROM THE DCE OR DTE THEREFORE PIN 24
	       MUST BE IN THE CABLE FROM DCE OR DTE DEVICE.)

	 SST2 (RECEIVER TIMING OR LOOPBACK TIMING ON THE ANSWER SIDE
	       MODEM)
	
   If dial back-up is being used enter the phone number into modem memory
   01.	
	 WP1/Wnnnnnnnn
	  RP  (read phone list to verify)


   SLCD0 will ignore DTR and keep the modem from dropping the line.
   STI000 will disable the modem's inactivity timer. If you do not do this
   the modem will drop the line every thirty minutes and retrain.

3) Turn the modem OFF set switch SWA-8 ON, Turn the modem back ON,
   the modem should come up in the SYNC mode. Turn on the LEASED
   If the modem is the originate modem make sure the ORIG LED is
   ON also, press the LOOP 2 button for at least 2 seconds to save the
   front panel confuguration.

   (NOTE) Check the cable at the modem end for DTR (PIN 20). If this
          pin is not + or - remove the pin from the cable at the modem
          connection.

4) Tymnet will be Answer and the Customer will be Originate.
	
6) To initiate a retrain press the # switch one time only.


	Making a Dial Back-up call from the Customer modem
	==================================================

1) Press the LEASE button (LEASE LED OFF)

2) Wait 2 minutes and press the # button once. This will dial the number
   stored in memory number 1 of the modem.
   There is a 1 minute timer on the ANSWER side. The ANSWER modem will
   not answer the dial back-up call until this timer has expired.

3) To terminate a dial back-up call press the LEASE button (LEASE LED
   ON) . This will take less than 30 seconds to drop dial and go back
   to LEASE.

		9600 baud SYNC X.25 dial-up Tymnet Site
		=======================================

	             Answer mode Tymnet Site
		     =======================

1) Turn the modem OFF. Set the rear panel switches to the following
   settings:

	SWA-2	ON	(9600 baud)

	SWB-1	ON
	SWB-4	ON

2) Turn the modem ON.  Hook  a terminal to the RS-232 port. Wake up the
   modem with two carriage returns . At the Modem prompt type RESET.
   When the modem responds with "are you sure?" type "Yes" and return.
   Now you are ready to enter the softstraps.

   At the Modem prompt enter the following soft straps:
	STI000
	SXLP000
	SAVE
	INIT
	(SLCD0 should be set only for a PAP by request of the customer
         only if the customer chooses to ignore the 3 minute timer
	 to drop DTR and Disconnect the call)

3) Turn the modem OFF and turn switch SWA-7 ON, SWA-8 ON AND SWA-8 ON.
   Turn the modem back ON.


3) Check the Modem's LEDs. The SYNC LED should be ON.
   For the Answer mode the ORIG LED should be OFF.

**NOTE**
REV 4 AND BELOW YOU WILL NOT SEE CLOCKS UNTIL A CONNECTION IS MADE
(DIAL OR LEASE).
REV 5 AND ABOVE YOU WILL SEE CLOCKS WHEN SYN MODE IS SELECTED.

For loop back testing you will need to the use the LOOP2 or LOOP3 button
on the front of the modem. If you loop back the channel interface card
the modem will never come up . For remote loop back testing use the
LOOP2 button this will place the remote modem in loopback.
Using a red box place it on the RS-232 port of the modem, press
LOOP2 and run a BERT test.  Test for 15 minutes.

ATTENTION:

An interim project to option da296 and na900 modems for 2400 baud Tymdial
X.25 access is in effect.  If required please option the da296 as follows
for this application.  Refer to CFB 180 for na900 options.  The da296 must
be running version level 5 PROM code for the following switches to operate
properly.

First, reset the modem.

As from above:
   RESET the modem Via the front panel by pressing the LEASED and
   the LOOP 2 button at the same for at least 2 seconds.
   Connect a 9600 baud terminal to the DTE port to program the soft-
   straps.
   With the modem powered up press the return key twice.
   At the  "MODEM >" prompt type RESET. The modem will ask
   "ARE YOU SURE ? [Y OR N]. Type a Y.
   This will reset the modem to the factory default settings if the
   front panel RESET didn't work.
   (NOTE) Only REV 5.0 modems will RESET via front panel. To check
   to modems rev level , at the MODEM> prompt type RSF, the rev level
   will apear on the top line of the RSF screen.

Now, set:
SWA #1 ON = 2400 port rate
SWA #4 ON = 2400 bit rate
SWA #6 ON
SWA #7 ON
SWA #8 ON

Power the modem off, then back on.  The da296 is now optioned for only 2400.
