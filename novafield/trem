        THIS CFB WILL DEFINE THE STANDARD CONFIGURATION OPTIONS AS TYMSHARE
        UTILIZES THE uP 9600 IN OUR SYNCHRONOUS COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN A
        NODE AND OTHER DISTANT EQUIPMENT EXCLUSIVE OF THE ANALYSIS SYSTEM.

        THIS PROCEDURE IS TO BE USED ONLY UNDER THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS:
          1. IF THE MODEM PAIR YOU ARE INSTALLING WILL NEVER BE IMPLEMENTED
             INTO THE ANALYSIS SYSTEM.
          2. IF THE MODEM PAIR YOU ARE PROVIDING MAINTENANCE ON:
             A. DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT PARTS OR MANPOWER TO COMPLETE THE
                CONVERSION OF THIS MODEM PAIR
             B. IF THE MASTER/SLAVE RELATIONSHIP OR THE LINE AND DROP NUMBER
                CAN NOT BE DETERMINED BY THE PERSONNEL WORKING ON THIS PAIR




                        G E N E R A L    N O T E S

        1. BOTH uP 9600 MODEMS IN THE TELCO CIRCUIT PAIR YOU ARE WORKING ON
           MUST BE TWO BOARD (MP & INTF) ONLY UNDER THIS CFB. IF NOT REMOVE
           ANY 96RD OR FSC BOARDS, OR SEE CFB 60 FOR CONVERSION TO ANALYSIS.

        2. SOME SWITCHES ARE LABELED "ON", AND SOME ARE LABELED "OPEN"

                THE PARADYNE STRAPPING CONVENTION IS:

                  OPEN = OFF = 1 = HIGH = +5v

                CLOSED = ON  = 0 = LOW  = 0.0v






                                                                        page 2

        2. INTF BOARD - INTERFACE (MODEM CARD)

           THERE ARE CURRENTLY TWO VERSIONS OF THE uP 9600 INTF CARD. THE
           EARLIER VERSION IS PART NUMBER -5061 AND THE LATER VERSION IS
           -5161. THE PART NUMBER VERSION IS STAMPED IN BLACK INK ON THE
           COMPONENT SIDE OF THE BOARD BETWEEN THE EDGE CONNECTORS. EACH
           VERSION OF THE INTF BOARD HAS IT'S OWN CHART BELOW.


        THE PRIMARY CHANNEL'S MASTER MODEM USES AN INTERNAL CRYSTAL OSCILLATOR
        TO SUPPLY THE CLOCKS FOR SYNCHRONIZING THE TRANSMITTER TIMING PHASE
        LOCKED LOOP.

        THE PRIMARY CHANNEL'S SLAVE MODEM USES THE RECEIVER CLOCK TO SUPPLY THE
        CLOCKS FOR SYNCHRONIZING THE TRANSMITTER TIMING PHASE LOCKED LOOP.

        THIS RELATIONSHIP IS STRAPPED ON THE INTF BOARD (5061 and 5161) BY
        SWITCHES: S6 #3  AND S6 #5.

                MASTER MODEM = S6 #3-OPEN, AND S6 #5-OPEN

                SLAVE MODEM = S6 #3-CLOSED, AND S6 #5-CLOSED

        FUNCTIONALLY IT DOES NOT MATTER WHICH MODEM IS THE MASTER, HOWEVER,
        IT IS MANDATORY THAT ONE MODEM IS MASTER AND THE OTHER IS SLAVE IN
        OUR POINT TO POINT NETWORK.

        AS A GUIDE LINE FOR CHOOSING WHICH MODEM TO STRAP AS MASTER FOR ANY
        PAIR, CHOOSE THE MODEM FUNCTIONALLY CLOSEST TO: FIRST, A TYMSHARE HOST,
        SECOND, A TYMSHARE NODE, OR THIRD, THE WESTERN MOST MODEM.
