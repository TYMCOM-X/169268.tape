************************************************************************

   Before any modem optioning is performed the slot code for this
   PAP must be modified with the following parameters or the modems 
   will not operate correctly causing many problems with the
   customer application.

   The following  must be added to the async slot t01 file and regenned :

   PVCRNG(n)	
   PVCEX(n,TID43,AID,NOHNG)

   "n"  being the DEC port the customer is on.
   ===
   TID43 sets the port to 2400 baud ASCII with space parity.

   AID sets automatic terminal identification.

   NOHNG allows an infinite TID timer and prevents the consat from
         hanging a port.

*NOTE*
MNP will be forced on for all PAP lease lines.

level on the dial line.

=========================================================================

The Series II Memotec/Concord modem will be used for a point-to-
point 4-wire and 2-wire leased line in the Async MNP mode. The 
Tymnet side will be the Answer modem and the customer will be the 
Originate side. 

=====================================================================

			MODEM SET UP PROCEDURE
			++++++++++++++++++++++
1) With the modem powered OFF;
   Take the top off the modem and set the following switches:
   SW1 is loacated at position U-34 on top board.
        SW1-3   ON  (2400 bps)
        SW1-5   ON  (DSR,DCD,CTS follow modem;hang-up on falling DTR)
   SW4 is located on the bottom board left side , set the following switch:
        SW4-8   ON  (X-mitt level on leased -0dbm)

   *Power UP the modem.
	
2) Reset the modem via the front panel by pushing the ERR and the TP at the
   same time for at least 2 seconds.
	>>>Use TERMITE If you can not get PROCOMM to work<<<
   Hook a terminal to the RS-232 (DTE) port and set the terminal 
   speed to 2400 bps.

   Type Return and you should get the CDS> prompt. At this time you
   want to type RESET. The modem wil resopnd with are you sure? ,
   type "Y" and return.

   At the CDS> prompt you want to enter the following commands each
   command terminated with a carriage return.

		SET LEASE LINE MODE CUSTOMER SIDE:
		=================================
   For the Customer site enter the following string and terminate with
   a carriage return:

        SLOSAVEINIT<CR>     (set Originate mode leased)


		SET LEASE LINE MODEM TYMNET SIDE :
		=================================
   The next command is for the TYMNET site modem only, this will turn
   off the response from the modem. You will see nothing after the SRM2
   is entered so enter it carefully.

   Enter the following terminating each command with a carriage return:
        SRM2
        SAVE
        INIT
   The save and init will not be seen.
   (To get back to the response mode type SRM0 and return.)

   ENTER THE FOLLOWING COMMAND TO PLACE THE TYMNET MODEM IN THE
   LEASE LINE MODE:

        SLASAVEINIT<CR> (set answer mode leased)
   (remeber you will not see what you have entered so do it carefully)

   **NOTE**
   Once the modems are in the Lease mode you will not be able to 
   set any soft straps, you will need to press the Lease button 
   and take the modem out of the Lease mode .

		DISABLE COMMAND MODE TYMNET SIDE
		================================
  For the Tymnet site you will need to disable the command mode after all
  the straps are set using SW1-4  ON. This is so the modem will not report
  for outdial use.

  Put the top back on the modem and set the rear panel switch marked
  4W/2W to the 4W or 2W  position.



   The modem(s) are ready for the install. Hook up the RS-232 cable to the
   DTE port and the four-wire leased line to the  Lease jack in the rear
   panel of the modem.

   On the front panel you will notice the data light flashing durning
   training mode. When the DATA LED is solid ,the PROT and the SYN LED
   will also be solid. The SQ LED will be solid after the handshake.
   The SYN LED and the PROT LED indicates the modem is in the MNP mode. 

   DTR must be present at BOTH SIDES of the circuit in order for the
   ===                    ==========
   leased line to come up and answered. Make sure DTR is showing on the
   front of the modem when the Async cable is attached. 

=======================================================================

			QUOTRON PC1000
			=============
 
 To exit and drop the lease line from the Quotron PC1000 package
use the ALT "q" , this will drop the DTR signal on the pc comm
port . The modem will follow this signal and drop carrier. 
The modem will re-establish the lease line when the PC1000 package
is executed. When the modem sees DTR it will put the modem back 
into the LEASE mode and hand shake with the answer modem. It is not
unusual for the modem to retrain twice the first time it comes up.
