***************************************************************************
The SIO5 board (P/N 470372-001) provides eight OCL ports and two V.35 ports.
Two breakout plates are necessary to provide connections for the OCL ports
with DB9 connectors and for the V.35 ports with two Winchester connectors.
The two breakout plates have the following part numbers:
     170895-012 - eight DB9 connectors for the OCL ports
     170895-014 - two V.35 Winchester connectors (This breakout plate is the
                     same as the one used for the SIO3 but with everything
                     blanked out except for the V.35 Winchester connectors).
Both breakout plates together are considered to be kit P/N 640352-001.

EXTERNAL CABLES:
   The following external cables connect to the breakout plate ports:
        V.35   P/N 160534-TAB (Winchester-male to Winchester-male)
        OCL    P/N 160526-001 (DB9 female to DB25 female)
        OCL    P/N 160629-TAB (DB9 female to DB9 female crossover)

The SIO5 board has no multifunction circuitry.

BACKPLANE SLOT ASSIGNMENT:
The SIO5 can go into any DMA capable backplane slot (0-4).  In an SIO3 CXL,
The SIO3 address 80 will be in the lowest slot (slot 0) so you can install the
SIO5 board in the next slot higher (slot 1).
In an SIO2 CXL the SIO2 address 80 will be in slot 4 so you can install the
SIO5 in slot 3 just below the SIO2 board address 80.
If additional SIO boards populate the CXL remember that the SIO5 can be
placed in any DMA capable slot as long as the backplane jumpers are correct.

The board has five port address rotary switches that set the addresses of each
port pair.  They are arranged on the front of the board as follows:
  The left front of the board has the four switches for the eight OCL ports
  and the right front of the board has one address switch for the V.35 ports.
  (Note:  The SIO board address switch is next to the V.35 port address switch).
  Here is a table of switches and port pairs:
    SW3 - 1st OCL port pair (labelled A/B)
    SW5 - 2nd OCL port pair (labelled C/D)
    SW6 - 3rd OCL port pair (labelled E/F)
    SW7 - 4th OCL port pair (labelled G/H)
    SW2 - V.35 port pair    (labelled A/B)

****  REMEMBER:  This board must be configured according to CFB 168.  This is
                 also true of the SIO2, SIO3, SIO4, SIO7, SIO8, and the
                 regular SIO motherboard.  The proper port configurations
                 for this board according to CFB 168 are as follows:

        Config #1:  2x56KB + 4 MS, or 2x56KB + 2 Ms, or 2x56KB + 0 MS,
                    or 2x64KB + 2 MS, or 2x64KB + 0 MS, or 2x72KB + 0 MS.
        Config #2:  8 MS, or 6 MS, or 4 MS, or 2 MS.


The port pair address switches are set according to the following chart:

     POSITION  M.ref
        0      0 & 1
        1      2 & 3
        2      4 & 5
        3      6 & 7
        4      8 & 9
        F      DISABLED (Use this position for all unused port pairs!)

At the front of the board there are five connectors.  Four are for the ribbon
cables connecting the OCL ports to the BREAKOUT PLATE at the rear door.  The
last connector is for the ribbon cable connecting the V.35 ports to the
BREAKOUT PLATE at the rear door.  The OCL connectors are J2, J3, J4, & J5.
The V.35 connector is J1.

Rotary switch S4 on the front right side of the board sets the motherboard
address (i.e. 80, 81, etc.).  The "8" part of the address is hardwired on the
board, so this switch only changes the second digit of the motherboard
address.  For example:  for address "82" you would set switch to "2".



Farther to the right and set back a little ways from the front are two slide
switches.  These provide a hardwired TRANSMIT clock on each of the two V.35
ports.  SW9 (farthest right) gives the clock to the first V.35 port.  SW10
(just to the left of SW9) gives clock to the second V.35 port.  This clock
is approximately 56KB and is for the Transmit only.  The clock is provided
when the slide switches are toward the front of the board.  These clocks are
mainly for testing and would be turned off when connecting to a DSU or other
device that supplies the clocking.  The hardwired clocking could also be used
to run a hardwired node-to-node link using a V.35 crossover cable (160490-001).



At the right-rear of the board are stake jumper pins E13, E14, E16, & E17.
These are normally left in the OPEN configuration when connected to the
present version of the Compact-XL that supplies +16.5 volts D.C. and -16.5
volts D.C. on the backplane.
If a new member of the Engine Family is released that supplies +12 volts and
-12 volts D.C. on the backplane then each of these four jumpers would be set
to CLOSED.

In the middle of the board, a little left of center and a little to the rear,
there is a jumper E12.  This jumper is included for future hardware develop-
ment on the board and should be left OPEN.

As with all other SIO boards the following jumpers should be removed from the
backplane pins of the slot:  122-222 and 137-237 (connector 0 side).



LOOPBACK PLUGS:

The following loopback plugs should be used on the breakout plate connectors
when running DSIO or SLSIO tests on the ports:
  630038-001  OCL Port (DB9) loopback
  630040-001  V.35 Winchester loopback

The following loopback plugs should be used on the connectors at the front
edge of the board when running DSIO or SLSIO tests on the ports:
  630086-001  OCL Ports (one loopback plug handles a port pair)
  630086-001  V.35 Ports (one loopback plug handles a port pair)
