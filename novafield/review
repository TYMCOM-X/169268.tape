THIS FORM TO BE COMPLETED PRIOR T YOUR PERFORMANCE REVIEW DISCUSSION WITH 
YOUR MANAGER.

1.) BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE YOUR CURRENT DUTIES.,EMPHASIZING THE MAJOR FUNCTIONS
    OF RESPONSIBILITES OF THE POSITION.

   I HAVE TRAINED NEW EMPLOYEES ON TYMNET EQUIPTMENT.. THIS INCLUDES NOT
   ONLY THE TYMNET ENGINES BUT THE PROBLEMS RELATED TO LINES BETWEEN NODES.
   I RUN DIAGNOSTICS AND LINE TEST TO DETERMINE WHICH PART OF THE 
COMMUNICATION LINK MAY BE CAUSING ERRORS.. ON A GLOBAL SCALE, I HAVE USED
   PROBE AND ITS ROUTINES TO HELP TROUBLE SHOOT PROBLEMS WITH THE NET WORK.
   DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS LIKE XRAY AND EXTENDED DDT COMMANDS ARE ALSO HELPFUL
   IN DETERMINING WHERE OUR EQUIPTMENT HAS FAILED..
   WE USE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MODEMS WITH IN OUT NETWORK. I HAVE USED CFB'S
  FOUND ON SYSTEM 55 IN SETTING UP NEW EQUIPTMENT AND CHECKING EQUIPTMENT
   ALREADY IN USE. 


2.)  SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHMENTS
     DESCRIBE SOME OF YOUR SIGNIFICANT ASSIGNMENTS / ACCOMLLISHMENTS SINCE
     YOUR LAST REVIEW DATE .

I HAVE WORKED WITH PRIVATE NETWORKS SWB AND VANET DURING THE INSTALLATINN
OF THE SUP SITE AND MANY OF THE REMOTE SITE INSTALATIONS. I RECIEVED AN
ONTYME FROME VA COMPLIMENTING ME ON THE OUTSTATDING SUPORT AND SERVICE
PROBIDED THROUGHT OUR DISTRIC. I HAVE WORKED WITH LOU AT THE SOUTH WESTERN
BELL SUP SITE ON PROBLEMS RANGING FROM OPTIONING NEW EQUIPTMENT SUCH AS 
THE PSM EQUIPTMENT , TO ISOLATING PROBLEMS IN EXISTING EQUIPTMENT WHEN
THE CODE IS CHANGED AND NOTHING SEEMS TO WORK AFTERWTHE CODE CHANGE.
IN ADDITION TO THE HARDWARE ACCOMPLISHMENTS , I HAVE WORKED WITH FILES
AND KEEPING THEM UPDATED...  WHENEVER THE NETWORK GETS CONFIGURED DIFFER-
-ENTLY FOLLOWING A PROJECT, THIS MEANS THAT FILES OF EACH NEIGHBOT HAVE
TO BE CHANGED AND UPAATED TO BE OF ANY USE TO EMPLOYESS IN THE CENTRAL 
DISTRIC.

I HAVE COMPLETED TRAINING IN X.25 ,XPC AND INTRO TO ISIS.EACH
EACH OF THE SOFTWARE CLASSES HAVE BEEN VERY USEFUL IN HELPING ME AS AN FE
ISOLATE SOME OOPTIONS PROBLEMS AND HARDWARE SOLUTIONS.



3.) GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
    DESCRIBE BRIEFLY SPECIFIC GOALS AND OBJECTIVES YOU PLAN TO OBTAIN BETWEEN
    NOW AND THE NEXT REVIEW PERIOD.

I WOULD LIKE TO GET TRAINING ON SOME MICRODATA SYSTEMS AND LIARN SOME OF
THE DIAGNOSTIC TECHNICES USED.I WOULD LIKE   ALSO I WOULD LIKE TO WORK 
WITH GENNING LAB CODE TO USE THE X.25,XPC AND INTRO TO ISIS CLASSES THAT
HAVE JUST COMPLETED... THESE WILL BE VERY USEFUL IN FINDIDG PROBL;EMS 
THAT DIAGS MAY NOT CATCH...


TH  I THIS
I THINK THAT THE PC COULD BE USED REMOTELY BY DIALING INTO THE COM PORT
, TO ACCESS THE FILES OR PROGRAMS STORED THERE. I PLAN TO READ SOME MANUALS
AND FIND OUT IF THIS IS POSIBLE, THEN TRY TO WRITE THE CODE TO  IMPLIMENT
THIS IDEA...


4.)  CAREER INTERESTS/DEVELOPMENT PLANS
     LIST YOUR CAREER INTERESTS AND INDICATE WHAT GOALS AND OBJECTIVES YOU HAVE
     TO FURTHER DEVELOP YOUR CAREER. DESCRIBE THE SPECIFIC STEPS OR THE ACCO-
    -MPLISHMENTS YOU WILL UNDERTAKE TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS. INCLUDE IN THIS
     TYPES OF WORK ASSIGNMENTS YOU WOULD PREFER TO RECEIVE.

I WOULD LIKE TO WORK  INTO A POSITION THAT REQUIRES MORE DEVELOPEMENT OF RATHER
   THAN THE USE OF NEW HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE. TO GET TRAINING THAT SUPLEMENTS
 THIS DESIRE I THINK THAT PROBLEMS THAT DONT FIT INTO THE NORMAL R&R CATAGORY
  TO FIX , WOULD   BE GOOD GROUND WORK FOR A FUTURE   POSITION MATCHING THE
 ABOVE DESCRIPTION.


 A CLASS AT A LOCAL SCHOOL THAT TEACHES CIRCUIT DESIGN  AND LAYOUT IS ON THE
LIST OF REQUIREMENTS THAT WOULD ALSO BE HELPFUL TO PERFORM THIS TYPE OF 
JOB WELL.


5.) DEVELOPMENT PLAN ACCOMPLISHMENTS
    INDICATE ACTIVITIES OR ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT WERE SIGNIFICANT IN YOUR
    CAREER DEVELOPMENT SICCE YOUR LAST
    (E.G  EDUCATION OR TRAINING DEGREE COMLLITION, EEMINARS. ETC.)

I HAVE HAD SOME CROSS TRAINING ON MICRODATA EQUIPTMENT. ALTHO BRIEF AND IN-
-FORMAL I HAVE BEEN OUT ON SOME SERVICE CALLS THAT INVOLVED DIAGS WITH REPLACE
MENT OF A DROVE, DIAGS TO A TAPE DRIVE WITH CORRECTIVE ACTION BEING REMOVA;
AND REPLACEMENT OF THE CONTROLLER BOARD. ANOTHER CALL INVOLVINGJ FOR A PRISM
IV REPLACEMENT , ALSO FOUND ANOTHER LOOSE FITTING HUB TO REEL FIT.  CUSTOMER
WAS HAVING FILE SAVE FAILURE..ADUSSTING CORRECTED THIS PROBLREM.


PROBLEMS HAVE COME UP WHILE STANDBY THAT INVOLVE GETTING PARTS SHIPED IN,
TROUBLISHOOTING REMOTELY, SELECTING REPAIR PARTS, DISPATCHING AND IMPLIMENT
ING THE NECESSARY REPAIRS TO GET THE COMMUNICATION LINK UP.
