HAVE REQUESTED ALL ORDER DELIVERIES RELATED TO THIS PROJECT TO BE SHIPPED
ON THE BASIS OF "24 HOUR NOTICE BEFORE DELIVERY" TO TYMNET FOR UNLOADING
AND PLACING EQUIPMENT ON LOCATION.  I NEED A RESPONSE ON THIS ITEM, ONE
WAY OR THE OTHER, IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT OUR LANDLORDS KNOW PROCEDURE.

SEVERAL INSTANCES WHERE BLOWERS DEEMED "TOO LOUD." THESE HAVE BEEN 
UNPLUGGED, WHICH IS CREATING EXCESSIVELY HIGH HEAT LEVELS. MANUFACTURING
NEEDS TO FIND A QUIETER BLOWER. THIS IS ANOTHER CASE WHERE I HAVE NOT 
BEEN ABLE TO GET A RESPONSE. SOME OTHERWISE SUITABLE SITES HAVE HAD
TO BE DISQUALIFIED. A FEW EXISTING SITES WILL HAVE TO BE REPLACED.

----------------------------------------

AUSTIN, TX
       HAVE REQUESTED SPECIFICATIONS FROM SOUTHWESTERN BELL FOR CONDUIT
       TRENCH. HAVE ASKED THE LANDLORD TO GET BIDS FOR TRENCHING THE PARKING
       LOT FOR TELCO EXPANSION, BASED ON SPECIFICATIONS RECEIVED FROM BIC
       ENGINEER. NODE ROOM IS EXPANDED, WAITING ON APPROVAL FOR RAISED FLOOR
       AND AIR CONDITIONING AND ELECTRICAL UPGRADE.

ORLANDO, FL
       LANDLORD HAS RECEIVED EXECUTED LEASE, SAYS HE WILL BEGIN IMPROVEMENTS
       FOR F.E. OFFICE IMMEDIATELY. HAVE REQUESTED PROPOSAL FOR MORE SPACE
       TO ACCOMODATE MORE F.E.'S, AS A MICRODATA LEASE IS EXPIRING IN 
       MARCH AND THEY WANT TO CONSOLIDATE OFFICES AT THIS ADDRESS.

BIRMINGHAM, AL
       F.E. OFFICE CONSTRUCTION COMPLETE.

MISSION, KS
       LANDLORD STILL REQUESTING SPECIFICATIONS FOR OUR SPACE IN HIS NEW
       BUILDING. HIS ARCHITECT IS DESIGNING ELECTRICAL LOADS, NEEDS
       OUR REQUIREMENTS (ROUGH ESTIMATE).

JACKSONVILLE, FL
       AM RESEARCHING FEASIBILITY OF REMOVING AIR CONDITIONER AT CUSTOMER
       SITE WHICH TYMNET PURCHASED AND CUSTOMER NO LONGER NEEDS. SEVERAL
       'E' SITE PROJECTS IN PROCESS COULD USE THIS. NEED TO KNOW WHERE 
       THIS UNIT MAY BE ASSIGNED.

SAN ANTONIO, TX
       HAVE REQUESTED INPUT FROM "FIELD SERVICE" WITH REGARD TO LEASE
       RENEWAL. THEY HAVE VERBALLY EXPRESSED FEELINGS FOR A SHORTER LEASE
       TERM (OPTION IS 5 YEARS).

LOUISVILLE, KY
       SITE IS CLOSED WITH REGARD TO FOOTPRINT AVAILABILITY. WILL CONTACT
       LANDLORD ABOUT ADJACENT SPACE.

FT. LAUDERDALE, FL
       CABLE PAIR SUPPLY IS EXHAUSTED. NO PROSPECT FOR EXPANSION AFTER THIS
       LEASE TERM 6-30-88, BUT ELECTRICAL UPGRADE, TELCO CABLE JOB, AND REMOVAL
       OF A WALL WILL KEEP SITE OPEN UNTIL THEN. HAVE FORWARDED BIDS FOR
       THIS WORK TO JOHN BAUMGARTEN, WAITING ON APPROVALS.

MIDLAND, TX
       HAVE LOCATED OFFICE SPACE IN TERMINAL, TX ON FX PROJECT
       THAT COULD DO DOUBLE DUTY AND MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO ELIMINATE MIDLAND 
       SITE. IF WE COULD POSTPONE FX CONVERSION THIS COULD ALL BE DONE

       AT THE SAME TIME BEFORE MIDLAND LEASE EXPIRES 10/1/86 (IT USUALLY
       TAKES 6-8 MONTHS TO INSTALL AN FX CONVERSION SITE ANYWAY).

MINNEAPOLIS, MN
       AIR CONDITIONER HAS BEEN RECEIVED AND INSTALLATION IS COMPLETE.

BROOKFIELD, WI
       NEW AIR CONDITIONER IS INSTALLED AND "ON LINE." FIELD
       ENGINEER NEEDS OFFICE SPACE. MDC IS TRYING TO "LEASE OUT" SPACE THAT WE
       HAVE UNDER CONTRACT. THIS SPACE IS OUR EXPANSION SPACE FOR NODE ROOM.
       SINCE LAST REPORT MDC SEEMS TO BE FLEXING ON THIS ADJACENT
       SPACE. MAY BREAK IT UP AND LET US KEEP PART OF IT.

OTHER ISSUES
------------

FACILITIES DATABASE
       THE DATABASE IS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SITES
       WHICH REQUIRE A SITE VISIT TO VERIFY QUESTIONABLE FIELD DATA.


AIR CONDITIONING
       56 A/C MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATED AND PROCESSED
       TO SAN JOSE. ONE REMAINS OUT FOR BID. INVESTIGATING A FEW MECH-
       ANICAL CONTRACTORS WHO SEEM TO BE HAVING PROBLEMS KEEPING OUR
       MAINTENANCE COSTS DOWN. MAY REQUIRE SOME CHANGES.

FIRE PROTECTION
       FIRE EXTINGUISHERS ARE MISSING AT TWO SITES; BOTH ARE PENDING MOVE TO
       NEW SITES. SITES WITH EXISTING FIRE EXTINGUISHERS ARE ALSO 
       BEING INSPECTED BY LOCAL SUPPLIERS AS NEEDED.

JANITORIAL SERVICE
       FOURTEEN JANITORIAL CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN SET UP. AS OTHER PROJECTS
       BECOME MORE COMPLETE, E.G., A/C MAINTENANCE, DATABASE ENTRY, WILL 
       PURSUE THE BALANCE. I WILL BE PURCHASING AN ENTRY FLOORMAT, A 
       TRASHCAN, AND A FREE-STANDING ASHTRAY FOR EVERY SITE AS I SET UP

       THESE CLEANING CONTRACTS.

ACCOUNTS PAYABLE
       PROBLEMS CONTINUE WITH RESPECT TO TIMELY PAYMENTS
       TO MY VENDORS: A JANITOR HAS RESIGNED AND A MECHANICAL
       CONTRACTOR HAS THREATENED SUIT. MANY HOURS ARE WASTED EVERY
       MONTH IN CHECKING UP ON REQUESITIONS AND PAYMENTS (OUR TIME
       AND BARBARA'S TIME; NOT TO MENTION EXPENSE OF PHONE CALLS).
