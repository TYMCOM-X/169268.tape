TYMSTAR
-------

HAVE COMPLETED INSTALLATION OF TEST UNIT IN DALLAS, AND IT IS FUNCTIONAL.

GREG NAUMAN IS NOW SENDING REQUESTS FOR CUSTOMER SITE INSTALLATIONS
WITH A TWO-WEEK DEADLINE ON THE SITE SURVEY AND 30 DAY INSTALLATION
DEADLINE.  I WOULD LIKE TO SEE EVIDENCE THAT FACILITIES MANAGEMENT IS
INVOLVED IN THIS PROJECT.  WITH EXISTING DUTIES AND REQUIRED
PREPARATION FOR THESE JOBS, THE GIVEN TIME FRAMES ARE NOT FEASIBLE.

IF THIS PRODUCT IS BEING SOLD WITH THE PROMISE OF A 30 DAY INSTALLATION,
OTHER REGIONAL FUNCTIONS WILL SUFFER NEGLECT TO KEEP SUCH A SCHEDULE.

I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MANAGEMENT'S EXPECTATIONS OF THE "REGION" ON THIS
PROJECT (I.E. TURN-AROUND TIME, WEEKS PER MONTH TRAVEL SCHEDULE, COST
RESTRAINTS, ETC.).

EXISTING SITE ISSUES
--------------------

AUSTIN, TX
       LANDLORD HAS RECEIVED SPECIFICATIONS FOR TELCO CONDUIT TRENCH. WILL
       BE VISITING THE SITE WITH CRAIG MICHELS ON FEBRUARY 26.

JOLIET, IL
       IT APPEARS THAT OUR EXISTING LEASE IS ILLEGAL. PLEASE SEE KAREN
       KENNY FOR DETAILS.  KACEY WILL BE GOING TO JOLIET THE WEEK OF 
       FEBRUARY 10. 

GLEN ELLYN, IL
       TAKING BIDS FOR BADLY NEEDED ELECTRICAL UPGRADE.

PEORIA, IL
       AM DISCUSSING ALTERATIONS TO OUR NODE ROOM WITH LANDLORD THAT WOULD
       MAKE ACCESS INTO AND OUT OF THE SPACE SAFER FOR FIELD ENGINEERS.

KALAMAZOO, MI
       REQUIRES SECOND AIR CONDITIONER PER ORIGINAL DESIGN. BIDS FOR EQUIP-
       MENT AND INSTALLATION HAVE BEEN RECEIVED.

LOUISVILLE, KY
       LANDLORD IS RESEARCHING POSSIBILITY OF ADJACENT SPACE AVAILABILITY.
       WE HAVE NO "RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL" OPTION, BUT WE ARE STUDYING AL-
       TERNATIVES.  THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF MOVING A WALL SO THAT ANOTHER
       ROW OF EQUIPMENT CAN BE INSTALLED, BUT THERE IS NO RAISED FLOOR
       SO WE REALLY NEED TO START LOOKING FOR A NEW SITE. LEASE EXPIRES
       9/1/87.

JACKSON, MS
       OUR BUILDING IS GOING TO BE DEMOLISHED LATE THIS SUMMER. WILL BE 
       GOING TO JACKSON WEEK OF 2/17 TO DISCUSS WITH LANDLORD THEIR OBLIGA-
       TION IN RELOCATING US.

------------------------------------------

OTHER ISSUES
------------

FACILITIES DATABASE
       THE DATABASE IS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS 
       WHICH REQUIRE A SITE VISIT TO VERIFY QUESTIONABLE FIELD DATA.
       HAVE INPUT THE MAJORITY OF CONTRACTOR INFORMATION INTO THE 
       DATABASE. UPDATING EQUIPMENT REPORTS ON BI-WEEKLY BASIS AS NEEDED.

AIR CONDITIONING
       HAVE MADE SEVERAL MODIFICATIONS TO THE A/C MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT FORM

       WHERE CLARITY IS NEEDED. WILL BEGIN TO PROCESS INVOICES THROUGH 
       THIS OFFICE AS CONTRACTS ARE RENEWED THROUGH THE YEAR. THIS CHANGE
       SHOULD SAVE TIME AND CONFUSION AND ALLOW US TO MONITOR INVOICES MORE
       CLOSELY.

JANITORIAL SERVICE
       FIFTEEN JANITORIAL CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN SET UP. I WILL BE PURCHASING
       AN ENTRY FLOORMAT,A TRASHCAN, AND A WALL-MOUNTED ASHTRAY FOR EVERY
       SITE AS I SET UP THESE CLEANING CONTRACTS. 

FIELD SERVICE COMPANY
       AM GRADUALLY LOSING CONTROL OF COMMUNICATIONS WITH THIS COMPANY AND
       THIS IS BEGINNING TO AFFECT MAINTENANCE OF SITES. HAVE NOT HAD 
       SUFFICIENT TIME TO MEET, P.R., AND "TRAIN" NEW DISTRICT AND REGIONAL
       MANAGERS, THEREFORE AM LOSING SOME SUPPORT FROM THIS BUSINESS UNIT.
       THIS TREND WILL CONTINUE WITHOUT ADDITIONAL SUPPORT.

NEW SITES BY CORPORATE PROJECT COORDINATORS
       THE REGION IS NOT GETTING THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE
       PROJECT SITE SEARCH AND DESIGN FUNCTIONS. SAFETY AND SITE
       FUNCTION ARE USUALLY SACRIFICED FOR A FEW FOOTPRINTS AND WHEN
       DOCUMENTS ARE SENT TO THE FIELD IT IS USUALLY TOO LATE TO MAKE
       SUGGESTIONS.


ACCOUNTS PAYABLE
       PROBLEMS PERSIST IN LATE PAYMENTS TO VENDORS AND UTILITY COMPANIES.
       SEVERAL SITES HAVE LOST POWER RECENTLY FOR NON-PAYMENT.
       SEVERAL SITES HAVE LOST POWR RECENTLY FOR NON-PAYMENT.
