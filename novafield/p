HARDWARE:  PARADYNE 3480 S
SUBJECT:  PARADYNE 3480 SYNC DIAL BACKUP SOFT-STRAP SETTINGS FOR POINT-TO-POINT


		   PARADYNE 3480 BACK CONNECTIONS

   Looking on the back of the Paradyne 34xx modem you find three modules.
The bottom module has two RS-232 female connectors, one marked ANALYSIS,
and one marked DTE/PORT 1, a jack for connecting the Eye pattern
generator to O-scope, one LED, a 5 position switch pack marked S1,
and Leased Line Interconnection to the DCAA/ACAA  module, marked LL.
   Module Two (the middle Module), is the optional DCAA/ACAA unit. This
module has one LED, a two position switch pack marked S6,  modular
jacks marked MODEM, LL, PH-RX, (RX-DIAL-TX), and PH-TX.
   Module three (top module) Mux board.

 		      LEASED LINE CONNECTION

Using the 6 inch modular cable supplied in the installation box, plug
one end in the bottom module marked LL.
Plug the other end in the second module (middle module) marked MODEM.

Plug the 3002 line (Leased Line) in the second module (middle module)
marked LL. THIS IS THE INTERCONNECTION BETWEEN THE MODEM AND THE DCAA/
ACAA MODULE, THE MODEM WILL NOT HAVE CONTROL OF THE AUTO CALL UNIT WITH
OUT THIS CONNECTION.

		      DIAL LINES CONNECTION

Plug both the dial lines in the second module (middle module), one line in the
jack marked RX and the other in the jack marked TX.  the other two jacks
marked PH-RX and PH-TX are for optional phones.  Remember which tele- phone
numbers you have assigned to the RX and TX lines.

	   SYNC/SIO TYMNET ENGINE/CUSTOMER  CONNECTION

Plug the Tymnet or Customer SYNC/SIO connection into the bottom module marked
DTE/Port 1.


			3480 POWER UP

   The modem performs a comprehensive test sequence that verifies operating
functions upon power-on. If a failure is decteded, an error message is dis-
played on the Diagnostic Control Panel (DCP)

   The DCP operations are divided into functional areas. The primary
functional areas are Local, Remote, Configure, Scan, and Install.
The Local mode allows complete setup, reconfiguration, and testing of the
local modem. Operation in the Remote mode is essentially the same as it is
in Local mode except it provides the means for the operator of a modem
stapped as Master to access the control panel functions of any of the
remote modems. This function is available without the need for a central-
site ANALYSIS system.

   The DCP keypad consists of eight pushbutton switches which you will use
to access and move through the Diagnostic Control Panel (DCP) Menu.

* Use the UP arrow to move up one level in the menu.
* Use the double UP arrow to exit any part of the menu in which you may
  be operating.
* Use the FUNCTION keys to make selection from the choices presented on the
  second line of the display. (F1, F2, F3, F4)
* The SCROLL keys (left and right arrows) have different functions depending
  upon the operation you are performing within the DCP Menu. Only four
  can be displayed in the second-line  windows above the function keys.
  When there are more than four choices, you must move the windows to display
  the additional choices. The small green LED beneath the arrow lights to
  indicate that there are additional choices off the display and the
  arrow indicates the direction of the window movement.


   SETTING THE SOFT-STRAPS FROM THE DCP (DIAGNOSTIC CONTROL PANEL)

   Power up the 34xx modem. The modem must Pass Self Test. The DCP
should display 19200 LED=PRT01. Press the Up arrow and the Double Up arrow
at the same time to get to the security levels. Select level number four (4).
Below this display should be six options, only four showing associated to
a function key. Use the Right arrow (Scroll key) to get to the last two
options.


THE CUSTOMER IS THE MASTER MODEM OR CONTROL MODEM WHEN USING THE MODEMS
DIAL BACK-UP CONFIGURATION.

A 3400 series reference card should be included with the modem breaking
down the DCP functions and it might be easier to follow.

   Depending which modem you are strapping, Master or Slave, do the
following:

Select  LOCAL, the next selection menu will appear.
PUSH THE RIGHT ARROW until the STRAP mode appears.
Select  STRAP, the next selection will appear.
Select  ACTIV, the next selection will appear.
Select  EDIT,  the next selection will appear.

Select  MODEM;

THE FIRST "S1" MODEM STRAP WILL APEAR. ENTER THE SOFTSTRAP FOR MASTER OR
SLAVE. INFORMATION ON STRAPS AT BOTTOM OF THIS CFB THEY ARE BROKEN DOWN
IN THREE SECTION  MODEM, DMC, AND  ACCA.

PRESS THE APPROATE STRAP SELECTION AND THE PUSH THE F1=NEXT.
WHEN DONE WITH ALL THE OPTIONS PRESS THE SINGLE UP ARROW TO GET BACK TO THE
EDIT FUNCTIONS.

SELECT THE DMC AND SET ALL THE DMC OPTIONS.GO BACK TO THE EDIT FUNCTIONS
AND SELECT THE ACAA OPTIONS. WHEN DONE WITH ALL THE OPTIONS, PRESS UP
ARROW TO RETURN TO THE EDIT FUNCTION MENU AND THEN PUSH UP ARROW AGAIN TO
RETURN TO CHOOSE FUNCTIONS AND THEN PUSH F2(SAVE) AND PUSH F1(ACTIV).
PUSH THE DOUBLE ARROW TO RETURN TO THE MAIN DISPLAY AND PUSH F4(SCAN).

	SETTING THE MODEM UP TO AUTO CALL WHEN THE LEASED LINE DROPS

  After the modem has been softstrapped and tested, go to the first DCP
window and select SCAN on the Master modem. Select Update. An alarm
will sound until the Master modem has checked all the options at both
ends. When the Alarm  goes out the Master modem should indicate
Drop OK on the DCP  LED.
 *  If Drop is not responding check the to see if the DMC address is set
at the drop modem to 0002. Use the INSTAL function to set the strap at
the remote modem and to update the master modem's configuration table.
 *  Use the CONFG function to log downline drops and DMC addresses in the
master modem's configuration table.

   Writing the Dial Back up number to the Master Modems memory
   +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

  If your modem has the ACAA bd and is set up correctely you
will find the soft options in the EDIT area of the modem. In
this area the LCD will display  MODEM  DMC  ACAA  etc. You
want to select ACAA.
  The first option is S1:RT, this is the area you write the
first dial number back up number.
Select Chng ; Input the first digit of the dial back up number
using the F1 or F2 key, this will scroll up or down the digits
needed for the number. Using the Left and Right Arrows move
over to next digit field and input next number, etc.
After you have the number in the S1 location press the single
up arrow, this will bring you to the next strap S2:RR. This is
the second dial back up number needed to complete the dial
back-up up call.
  Follow the same procudure for input of this number. When done
press the up arrow twice to the SAVE field, press SAVE , then
press ACTIV.
