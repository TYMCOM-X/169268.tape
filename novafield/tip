      Please be aware that in order to use the Model 931 and Model 932 modems
   with Crosstalk, you must first change the default settings of the internal
   dip switches.  The required settings are documented in Appendix E of the
   931/932 User's Manual.

      If you don't have a copy of the manual to reference, send me an ontyme
   (NSMS.CONNIES) and I will have a copy of the relevant pages mailed to you.

      This is to reiterate the NSSU policy which is that:

                       NSSU will NOT stage ATCs.  

      NSSU considers the ATC to be in the same category as modems.  That is,
   there is no user loadable software to be staged.

      NSSU could arrange for ATCs (modems or other ordered equipment) to be
   delivered to staging if the field organization desires to invest the labor
   to stage these items.  NSSU will endeavor to supply the supporting mission
   of supporting the staging of network systems.

      At our request, Softronics has just completed adding 24 function keys to
   their 3101 emulation package.  For those customers that have version 1.02,
   they can call up the Softronic Electronic Bulletin (303)593-9530 and down-
   load the file "IBM 31012.TML" to the PC.  If the customer has an earlier
   version of software, the customer can request a software upgrade to version
   1.02.

      The following, is a description and an example of the CUD/MUD format
   of a private network:

                               CUD/MUD Format


        Each CUD/MUD block consists of:

             - a variable number of user entries of variable length
             - the block checksum (Engine) in the last 4 bytes


        User entries are in the following format:


                               1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3

        on a halfword boundry


    Note: The maximum size for each access entry is 14 bytes; the
          maximum in-place origin size is 10 bytes (5 hosts or nodes).
          The entry is terminated by at least one half word of hexadecimal
          0FFFF.

        WORD

           0  bits 0-7 size of entry is 52 hex bytes.
              bits 8-31 zero

         1-3  username NETVALNEW1.  Since bit 0 on for word 3, thus the
              last word is D7310000 instead of 57310000.  Username is word
              bound.

           4  A82360D2 is the password cipher.

           5  1591FB96 is the ISIS time, in decimal is 361888662.
              The remainder of 361888662/60 is 42, which is the second,
                  remainder of 6031477/60 is 37, which is the minute,
                  remainder of 100524/24 is 12, which is the hour,
                  remainder of 4188/365 is 11, adding 74 to it, is the year,
                  leap years have to be taken into account, thus
                      number of days = 173 - integer((11+1)/4) + 1 = 171,
                  171-31-28-31-30-31 = 20, therefore, it is June 20th.

           6  Gan is 1 in octal

           7  Uun is 14426 in octal.

           8  bit 14 is on, indicates new password.
              district is 1.

           9  105C is the password change date, in decimal is 4188.  From the
              formula above, we get 6/20/85

       10-11  Access Entries 1
              BIT
              0-3  size of access entry is 8 bytes.

             ONLINE DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR ONTYME IDS 
             --------------------------------------------------
             --------------------------------------------------


Written by : Eileen Riordan
      Date : July 2, 1985




      Thanks to the efforts of Peter Haas (MDISI) there is a program running
   on some 370's which allows you to easily search for a fellow employee's
   OnTyme ID.  It's computerized directory assistance!
 
   In order to use this directory search service, you must fulfill a few
   prerequisites:

   1.  You must have a valid OnTyme ID

   2.  You must be listed on one of the following directories:

        *** DIRECT.TYM        *** DIRECT.TYMHQ      *** DIRECT.NSS
        *** DIRECT.NSMS       *** DIRECT.NETS       *** DIRECT.ENS
        *** DIRECT.TYMPLN     *** DIRECT.TYMOPS     *** DIRECT.TYMNFE
        *** DIRECT.ISITPR     *** DIRECT.TDI

       (note:  if you are not listed on one of these directories, notify
        your account supervisor (:SEND SUP)

   3.  You must have access to one of the following 370 hosts:

                       40     43      47      48

       (note:  If you don't have a username on any of these hosts -
       don't worry - see final section of this memo for further 
       instructions)


   INSTRUCTIONS
   ============
   
   1.  Log into your 370 username on system 40, 43, 47 or 48

   2.  At prompt, attach to INTLIB  (C>ATT INTLIB)

   3.  At next prompt type MEMO  (C>MEMO)

   You are now in the OnTyme Memorandum System.  

   4.  At next prompt (Function:) enter  >SEARCH

   You are now in the Directory Assistance Program.

   5.  When prompted for Name, you may enter a person's last name only,
       last and first name (separated only by a comma and no spaces),
       or a left subset of the last name.  For example:

        Name:              OR    Name:              OR    Name:
         >WALKER                  >WALK                    >WALKER,GARY

      The system will search the directory and list out all occurrences of the
   string you input.  The first two instances will include all OnTyme IDs.
   If there are more than two, it will simply list all the person's having
   that character string in their name and allow you to further search.

   For example.  If you were trying to find out Warren Prince's ID:

       Name:
        >PRINCE
       "PRINCE" identifies Don Prince (CNS.D/PRINCE)
          but could also identify Warren Prince (TYM.PRINCE)

   Or trying to find the ID of someone whose last name is SMITH:

       Name:
        >SMITH
        "SMITH" identifies Bruce Smith (TYM.B/SMITH)
           but could also identify Brad Smith ( CNS.BRAD/SMITH)
           or Bruce Smith, Charles Smith, Chris Smith, Cindy Smith
           ..... Jody Smith .... Wanda Smith, Wade Smithson
           (note it took SMITH to be a left subset of SMITHSON)

   6.  When done, at prompt type   >LOGOUT.


      You will note there are other capabilities in this program which you
   are free to use IF you are using your own 370 username.  Type a question
   mark (?) at any prompt in the program to find out your options.

   THOSE WHO DO NOT HAVE THEIR OWN 370 USERNAME......

   At the Please Log In enter    ONTYME  (no password).

   When prompted with PROJECT CODE:  enter your last name
   (eg.  PROJECT CODE: BRADFORD)

      The system will search the directory to find all occurrences of BRADFORD
   and list them out.  Assuming your user ID will be among them, it will
   then prompt you for your ONTYME KEY>.      Enter your Key.    The program
   will attempt to built an aux circuit from the 370 to your OnTyme ID
   to be sure you are a valid OnTyme user.

      Now follow steps  3  thru 6 above to use the Search Program.  Please
   do not use any other features from this 370 username (ONTYME).

      You can use this program to help find OnTyme IDs of anyone in any of
   the above listed accounts, and almost anyone else in the McDonnell
   Douglas organization, provided he/she is listed in a *** DIRECT.file
   somewhere in OnTyme.

      The directory is generally updated about once a month - so it is
   not up-to-the-minute - but is an excellent source for 95% of your 
   directory needs.

   Enjoy!

   (THESE INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE AVAILABLE IN THE ONTYME FILE 
    *** ONTYME.IDSEARCH)

      Good News!  On Monday, July 15 version 2.06 of CMTI will be in Limited
   Release.  If you want to see it log on to the demo with the network logons
   logons "cmtdem1" thru "cmtdem8".   The other demo slots will be upgraded
   soon.
 
      IMPORTANT!!!  The feature TYPE AHEAD has undergone a major change in the
   way it functions in version 2.06 .  An end user can not start to Type Ahead
   until the screen starts to paint.  If the user tries to input before this 
   time the terminal will sound its bell because the keyboard is in a locked 
   state and the data will probably be lost or garbled.  Please be careful how
   you sell this feature.
 
      The following is a summary of all the new features and functionality 
   that is available with 2.06 .

   New Terminal Definitions:
       VT52
       VT220

       IBM 3101 character mode
       Qume QVT103
       PCI Networker78
       TTY terminals (limited support)
 
   Additional Keys:
       RESET
       HOME
 
   New Features:
       Menu Bypass

      In addition to the "Q" command not working, the Tymshare model 923 does
   not have the ability to acurately process (at its command level) a dial 
   string coming from an X.75 gateway.  Two(2) VEN-TEL 212 PLUSII ver 2.20 
   modems have been tested in this configuration and have passed.  (The "Q"
   command works on this model too).  If your customer is logging on through 
   an X.75 gateway and you are unable to install the VEN-TEL 212 PLUSII ver 
   2.20, I cautiously recommend preprogramming the dial string in the Tymshare
   model 923's memory.  If you have any questions regarding this issue, please
   ontyme NSS.WING .


   Note:  the Tymshare model 925 fitted with version 2.20 proms is the
          equivalent to the VEN-TEL 212 PLUSII ver 2.20 modem.

       WILL SDLC AND ANOTHER PROTOCAL RUN OFF THE SAME DAUGHTER BOARD?

      WILL SDLC AND ANOTHER PROTOCAL RUN OFF THE SAME DAUGHTER BOARD?

      This was an RFI that recently came into the HQTECH.  A meeting was held
   to discuss the issue.  Basically, there seemed to be no reason why 2
   different protocals couldn't run off the same daughterboard.  So Chung Shaw
   came up with a test plan.

      John Burrough and Jim Stein (NTS) carried out the plan.

      A machine was set up with 4 slots - 2 X25 slots and 2 1.11 SDLC slots.
   The SDLC slots were connected by a loopback connector, as were the X25 
   slots.  2 daughtercards were used - each one was connected to both an X25
   slot and an SDLC slot.

      The test for the X25 slots was to log into the DCE slot, then through
   the DTE slot into ONTYME.  A "READ ALL:" was done, and while ONTYMES were
   being printed, the SDLC test was done:

      Basically, the SDLC test is the loopback test documented in "TYMNET
   SDLC INTERFACE:  General Internal Maintenance Specification", page 9.
   This involves making sure the SDLC slots are initially in Normal 
   Disconnected Mode.  Then, through NAD-DDT, you send a SNRM from the HIF to
   the TIF, and a UA from the TIF to the HIF.  Then you make sure both slots 
   have changed into Normal Response Mode.

      These 2 tests were run at the same time.  They worked.

      Then the daughter cards were changed out and a PSM put into the engine.

      One again the tests were run together, and again they worked.

      The tests indicate that X25 and SDLC can run off the same daughter
   card or PSM.

             Before the installation of a product at a beta site,
             a PRE-BETA INSTALLATION CHECKLIST must be completed.
     
      Field support and Sales must coordinate with Marketing Quality Assurance
   and Product Marketing in the selection of potential Beta Test sites.  (Once
   potential sites have been selected, Product Marketing will notify all
   concerned of the selection.)   
     
   In the selection of a site the following need to be considered:  
             RELATIONSHIP:  Is there familiarity, trust and a    
                  willingness to sign a Beta Test Agreement?
             LOCATION:  Is the customer close to the group which 
                  is responsible for support?
             TRAINING:  Have all assigned Tymnet personnel, and if    
                  necessary, customer personnel, completed training?  
             EQUIPMENT:  Does the customer have the required
                  hardware and software or has it been ordered?  
             STAFF:  Is there adequate customer staff to carry out    
                  testing?    
     
      Before Tymnet can proceed with the installation of a product at a 
   selected beta site, a PRE-BETA INSTALLATION CHECKLIST must be completed.  
   The confirmation and completion of the checklist will be done at an 
   arranged conference call/meeting.  The purpose of this meeting is to assure
   that all necessary tasks have been completed, before the beta test 
   installation occurs.  This meeting will be chaired by Mktg. Quality 
   Assurance and attended by the following departments:     Product Marketing,
   HQ Technical Services, Network Technology Division (NTD), Network 
   Technology Services (NTS), User Documentation, Training, the assigned Field
   Communications Consultant (Conference call, unless local), and Sales 
   Representative (Conference call, unless local).   
     
   To set up a time for a conference call/meeting, please contact me:    
            Ontyme - NSS.D/FOWLER  or  Ph: 408-942-5065
   If you have need of any additional information regarding betatest:    
            consult the BETA TEST GUIDELINES - located on   
            system 39 (soon to be a *** ontyme file).  
     
            or contact either me or John Gomes, Mktg. Q.A Mgr.:  
            Ph:  408-942-5142

Written by : Ping Chu
      Date : July 25, 1985




      This memo serves to inform you that our SDLC Interfaces do not zap
   the permanent virtual circuit (PVC) for no reasons.  When you notice the
   CIRCUIT ZAPPED message in using the LOGTABLE command of the SDLC monitor, 
   it may be issued for any one of the reasons:



      Under the following circumstances, the  SDLC  interface will send an
   ISIS message "9E" DETACH to detach a permanent virtual circuit.


          1.  The DSR signal dropped on the line between Front End 
              Processor and the SDLC Host Interface.

          2.  A monitor user entered the SHUT command for  a  specific
              station  via  the monitor host co-residing with the SDLC
              Host Interface.

          3.  A moniotr user entered the SHUT command to shut the host
              line via the monitor host co-residing with the SDLC Host
              Interface.

          4.  The SDLC Host Interface has used up  all  its  available
              ports  and  reports  the HOST OUT OF PORT message to the
              supervisor.  The Host Interface will not honor  any  new
              needle  requests  and  it  shall  detach the new circuit
              which exists because of the new needle request.

          5.  The SDLC Host interface sends the SELECT DIALECT command
              -  8080, but the SELECT DIALECT response - 8081 does not
              come back  from  the  Terminal  Interface  to  the  Host
              Interface  in  time.  The Host Interface will not accept
              this user's needle request.  It would also  detach  this
              circuit.

          6.  When the Host  Interface  receives  a  ZAPPER  from  the
              network,  it  will unconditionally send a DETACH message
              for this circuit.

          7.  When the Host Interface receives a "C089" CALL USER DATA
              and  it  finds  out that the control unit's address does
              not match with the PU address gened in the tymfile.

          8.  The user tries to logon to the monitor host, but his/her
              name is not on the GOODGUY list gened in the tymfile.

          9.  The second time the user uses the same username to logon
              to  the  monitor  host  while the first circuit is still
              intact.  The Interface  will  DETACH  the  second  logon
              request.

         10.  The user logs off the monitor host  by  typing  EXIT  or
              BYE.  This will cause the circuit being detached.

         11.  Upon receipt of an ISIS message "AE" BREAK (such as  the
              monitor  device  gets  powered off all of a sudden), the
              Interface will DETACH this circuit.



      Under the following situations the SDLC Interface  will send an ISIS
   message "9F" ZAPPER to zap a permanent virtual circuit.


          1.  At the intialization time, the interfaces clear out  all
              the active circuits.

          2.  When the SDLC Terminal Interface receives an  ISIS  "B5"
              message  -  LOGON FAILURE, it will ZAP the corresponding
              circuit.

          3.  The SDLC Terminal Interface has already received a  real
              pseudo  needle  "B2"  from  the  Node  Code, but it then
              receives a spurious pseudo needle.   In  this  case,  it
              will zap the circuit to avoid confusion.

          4.  The DSR signal dropped on  the  line  between  the  SDLC
              Terminal Interface and the control unit.

          5.  A monitor user entered a SHUT  command  for  a  specific
              station  via  the monitor host co-residing with the SDLC
              Terminal Interface.

          6.  A monitor user entered a SHUT  command  for  a  terminal
              line  via  the  monitor  host  co-residing with the SDLC
              Terminal Interface.



      When the SDLC Host Interface recognizes the circuit being zapped, it
      will:


          1.  release all the input bufferlets, output bufferlets  and
              the  command  link  lists  which  are  flowing  from the
              background processing to the  foreground.   Please  note
              that  whatever  data  sitting  in the SIO buffers remain
              intact.  In other words, the SIO motherboard will try to
              transmit whatever queued up in its SIO trasnmit buffer.

          2.  send an ISIS "9E"  DETACH  message  to  disconnect  this
              user.



      When the SDLC Terminal Interface recognizes the circuit being zapped,
   it will:


          1.  release all the input bufferlets, output bufferlets  and
              the  commad  link  lists  which  are  flowing  from  the
              background processing to the  foreground.   Please  note
              that  whatever  data  sitting  in the SIO buffers remain
              intact.  In other words, the SIO motherboard will try to
              transmit whatever queued up in its SIO transmit buffer.

          2.  increment the Logon Retry counter by one.

          3.  If we have not exceeded the limit of Logon Retry,  which
              presently is hardcoded to 16 times,

                      Then the Terminal Interface will wait until  the
                      PVCTIMER  to  timeout;   which is defined in the

      Starting the middle of July '85, SNA version 1.03 has become one of
   the  limited  release products.  In July 26, the baseline manager released
   all the relevant SNA code to the SOURCE directory.  In  this directory, it
   has the most up-to-date PATCH files which has been proved working and
   de-escalated.  In the consequence, you may want to assemble your SNA slot 
   code from the SOURCE directory.
     
      The next page is a copy of  COMMAND  file  for  your  reference.  Please
   note that the standard patch file SNA01.P03 contains four individual 
   patches, which are listed as below.  Be sure not to double assemble the 
   patch files.    
     
      (SOURCE)SNA01.P03 has the following patch files as of July 26, 1985.    
     
         1.  (PINGCHU)HLSCHD.P13   
     
         2.  (PINGCHU)NONTFY.P13

      In order to be more response to software problems and issues in other
   time zones, Gary Walker's Technical Serive Department will initiate an
   "EARLY BIRD SERVICE" beginning (Monday, July 22, 1985 at 6:00 a.m. Pacific
   Daylight Savings time).  This early bird serice will be offered 5 days a
   week.

      To reach this service dial:   (408) 434-0453

      This number will be utilized from 6:00 a.m. - 8:00 a.m. (California
   Time) only.

      If after 60 days this proves beneficial to your requirements, we will
   add more personnel to this function.

      Try us, you will like it!

      This is response to an 'RFI' about load-leveling of multi-based X.PC
   network servers in the public network.

      Detailed analysis of the circuit building process in the SUP code
   revealed that the initial list of MAXDST=6 targets is construced from the
   particular class position of the MUD entry.  For multi-based hosts, the 
   first available base is entered on this list as one entry.

      During the patch finding process when the circuit costs are calculated,
   another list of MAXDST=6 target nodes is constructed from the initial list,
   but this time the multi-bases are taken into account.  Note that this final
   list is a list of destination nodes to be considered in the patch finding,
   unlike the initial list which is a list of target nodes and hosts.  Hence,
   if the initial list contained a multi-based host of six bases as the first
   entry and if all six bases are available, then the final list contains only
   these six bases as destination nodes; the other five entries in the initial
   list are dropped from consideration in the path finding process.

      In conclusion, there is load-leveling for multi-based hosts.  Again, I
   must emphasize that the interaction of multi-targeting and multi-based 
   hosts is dependent on the MUD entries.

      In the SNA world, when a half-session sends data to its corresponding
   session partner, it has no way of knowing if the session partner has
   received the data unless it is acknowledged by a RESPONSE.

      There are 3 types of response protocols in the SNA world:

              1.  Definite Response
                       The sender requests the receiver  to  return  a
                  response   unconditionally,   whether   positive  or
                  negative, to that request.

              2.  Exception Response
                       The receiver returns a negative  response  only
                  if  the received data is unacceptable;  otherwise it
                  does not respond at all.

              3.  No Response
                       No matter the received data  is  acceptable  or
                  unacceptable,  the  receiver does not respond to the
                  sender.


      The usage of these responses are illustrated as follows:

              1.  Responses  are  returned  if  the  session   partner
                  requests for DEFINITE RESPONSES.

                           Note : The sender does not re-transmit the 
                                  "Data 2" or nor "Data 3".




               For  every  SNA  message,  it  is  prefixed  with   the
          Transmission header and the Request/Response header.  
               In the Request header, there are three bits  indicating
          the  types  of responses (i.e., Definite Response, Exception
          Response, and No Response)  that  the  sending  half-session
          requests    for    the    acknowledgement    of   this   SNA
          request-message.
               In the Response header, there  is  one  bit  indicating
          whether  this SNA response-message is a positive response or
          a negative one.
               It  may  increase  unnecessary  line  traffic  if   the
          customer  uses  the  Definite  Response  protocols  for  all
          transmissions.  The SNA does allow, in  fact  it  implicitly
          recommends,  to  use a combination of Definite and Exception
          Responses to eliminate the unnecessary traffic delay.

               As you may be able to point it out from this chart that
          the SNA protocol enforces the Definite Response to be issued
          for every outstanding request message in the SSCP-PU session
          and the SSCP-LU session.
               However, the protocol allows the response to be in  any
          one  of the form of Definite Response, Exception Response or
          No Response for every outstanding  request  message  in  the
          LU-LU session.

               Once  we  have  gone  through   the   SSCP-LU   session
          establishment and proceed to the LU-LU session, the possible
          delay caused by the end-to- end acknowledgement, which is  a
          must  in  the SSCP-PU or SSCP-LU sessions, can be eliminated
          by  adapting  a  mixture  of  the  Definite  Responses   and
          Exception Responses.

               If your SDLC customers ever have complaints  about  the
          slow  response  time  when they use the SDLC interfaces, you
          may advise them to research their IBM VTAM gen and  the  way
          their  transaction-oriented programs issue calls to the CICS
          or IMS, or TSO, or other major application systems.

               In the IBM VTAM  gen,  there  is  a  set  of  parameter
          settings  to  define the bind image.  This macro is LOGMODE.
          Under this macro, it leaves room for the VTAM programmers to
          define  the  Function  Management Protocols for both primary
          logical unit and secondary logical unit.   In  the  Function
          Management  Protocol, it also permits any combinations of No
          Response, Definite Response and Exception Response.

               In addition to optimizing the LOGMODE parameters of the
          VTAM gen, the IBM major application systems also play a very
          important role in speeding up the  communication  round-trip
          traffic.   These  major  application systems such as CICS or
          IMS, when issue the SEND macro call to  VTAM,  they  have  a
          choice  to  tell  VTAM  whether the application system shall
          expect a Definite  Response  or  Exception  Response  or  No
          Response  to  the  sending  message.  Therefore, the network
          round-trip delay can be improved by CICS asking an Exception
          Response in the SEND macro.

               After the BIND is sent to the secondary  logical  unit,
          both half session partners have to be in conformity with the
          binding agreement.  There is no way  to  alter  the  binding
          agreement in the LU-LU session.

               Tymnet  SDLC  interfaces  provide  an  extension   cord
          service  to  the  SDLC  users.   It  does neither SNA-to-BSC
          protocol conversion nor SNA protocol validation.  It  checks
          whatever  is  defined in the SDLC-layer's protocol, which is
          very  minimal  as  opposed  to  other   five   upper-layers'
          protocols.   It  simply passes whatever it receives from one
          end to another.  Therefore, it does not waste time in making
          sure  that  the  user  data conforms to the protocols of SNA
          upper-layers.

Written by : David Pau, Interface Support
      Date : August 1, 1985




      Recently we have received a notice from IBM indicating the availability
   of a new release of microcode for 3274 Control Units with support 'C'.  The
   following is a copy of the notice from IBM.  You will notice that the new
   microcode addresses a number of problems on the 3274 and many of the 
   problems are SNA related.  Although no escalation reported so far, is the 
   result of the mulfunction described in the notice, it is important that all
   our technical support personnel are aware of such release.
 


   Dear IBM Customer:  

      IBM now has a new level of microcode available for 3274 Control Units
   with Configuration Support 'C'.

      This level (E. C. 389208, Release Level 49.0) may be ordered for all 
   3274 models that have Configuration 'C' installed.

      This microcode release will not be sent to you unless you specifically 
   order it.  

      To install this release, follow the update diskette procedure described 
   in 3274 Planning, Setup, and Customizing Guide, GA27-2827-14, or higher.

      If you need to discuss this update with I.B.M. service Personnel, it is 
   described to them in Engineering Change Announcement (ECA) # 199


   MAINTENANCE ENHACEMENTS IN THIS RELEASE, CORRECT THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS:


   Models 31A:

   A 3274 hang condition when OEM channel extenders are used.  (PTR 3384)

   The 3274 causes repeated transmission of data to the host.  (PTR 3511)

   When data is sent in SSCP session to a 3278 Model 2 and the cursor is in
   the last position on the screen, any more data entered from the keyboard
   causes the cursor to disappear.  When the screen is rewritten, the fist 
   of data is incorrect.                                       (PTR 3602)


   Models 31C and 51C:

   A 3274 hang condition in conversation reply mode.           (PTR 3509)


   Models 31C, 31D and 51C:

   A read modified command chained to a write command causes more than one
   field of data to be read in from the display screen, thus making it 
   possible to wrap the screen and continue to read data until the byte 
   count is reached.                                           (PTR 3506)


   Models 1D, 31D and 41D:

   A condition in which the RTM timer is erroneously reset.    (PTR 3758)


   Models 31A,31C,31D and 51C:

   When a 5210 printer is attached as an LU3 (DSE/DSC) device, an LU3 query
   results in an incorrect usable area query reply.            (PTR 3508)

   A 3274 hang condition when sending data to a printer.       (PTR 3575)


   Models 31C, 41C, 51C and 61C

   Corrects a 3274 hang condition that occurs with an '8 4 2 1' indication
   of '1001' when the 3274 is customized for the X.21 Nonswitched commu-
   nication interface option and a nonwrappable modem or no modem is 
   attached.                                                   (PTR 3541)


   Models 41A, 41C, 41D and 61C:      

   A 3274 diagnostic problem (with an '8 4 2 1' indication of 0100) occurs
   when a 3299 Terminal Multiplexer is attached to port 0 by more than
   3000 feet of coaxial cable.                                 (PTR 3803)


   Models 31A, 31C and 51C using SDLC:

   An incorrect RU is sent to an LU1 printer.  An incorrect sequence number
   is returned when an LU1 printer is powered off while printing.
                                                               (PTR 3521)
   
   Lost screen data from display station keyboard when the host is 
   processing a keyboard ATTN (attention) request.             (PTR 3530)

   A 3274 hang condition that occurs when the host sends segmented SSCP
   messages to a physical unit that results in the Time symbol (X and clock)
   being displayed on some display screens or prevents power on of others.
                                                               (PTR 3542)

   An RQMS request with reset counters indicated is not rejected properly.
                                                               (PTR 3549)

   With a SHUTC pending for an LU1 printer, the printer must be reset to get
   on line.                                                    (PTR 3581)

   A condition in which the RTM clock is not stopped when the host unlocks the
   display keyboard but leaves the display in the receive state.  The timer
   must stop if RTM definition is Keyboard Usable.             (PTR 3614)


   Models 51C and 61C with X.21 Switched function:

   Permits execution of noormal IML when no modem cables are attached to 
   the 3274.                                                   (PTR 3744)


   Models 31A, 42A, 31C, 41C, 51C and 61C using SDLC:

   A 3274 hang condition in which ACTLUs queued to devices during close
   processing are flushed and buffers are lost.  This occurs especially after
   a bringup with the PU active from the previous operation.
                                                               (PTR 3567)


   Models 1A, 21A, 31A, 41A, 1C, 21C, 31C, 41C, 51C and 61C using SDLC:

   A 3274 hang condition caused by a pacing overrun on an LU1 printer.  The
   affected printer attempts to print invalid data.            (PTR 3707)

   A condition in which an LU1 printer stops printing even though data 
   is sent to it.  The 3274 must be re-IMLed for printing to resume.
                                                               (PTR 3783)

   Incorrectly sending SSCP data to a printer resulting in a sequence 
   number error on LU-LU data.                                 (PTR 3801)

      We will clear the requests through the Quality Assurance and Technical
   Support groups here at headquarters and arrange for the installation to 
   begin.

      Technical support personnel should be aware of certain restrictions 
   applied to the Extended DDT support for the V3.01 software. These
   restrictions in no way affect the normal functioning of the interface
   (i.e. the customer won't be affected), but they do affect debugging
   operations on the slot. Please refer to page 06, of this TECH TIP bulletin
   for details on the DDT restrictions. 

      The following new external and internal features will appear in V3.01:

   o  Permanent Virtual Circuits (PVC's) as specified in the CCITT X.25
      recommendation is now available.

   o  Throughput performance has improved.

   o  Reverse Charging can be forced to occur if a calling address contains
      a match with a specified character string.

   o  Improved debugging facilities allow selection of specific debugging
      functions such as packet buffer trace, packet trace and link trace, and
      repeat a selected sequence.

   o  Session clearing causes and diagnostics are reported to accounting,
      offering more precise session monitoring.

   o  The maximum number of simultaneous circuits is increased to 1024.

   o  Called and Calling Address Modification can be performed on addresses
      for networks when address requirements differ between networks. This
      is primarily for private networks and international gateways and gives
      the customer more flexibility for interconnections.

   o  A logical break key other than the "break key" can be specified as
      the break signal from the start-stop DTE for X.3 parameter 7. This
      gives the end user additional keyboard independence when accessing 
      the network.

   o  An assembly time ID can be specified containing the current date and
      time so that the NAD (Node Assembler/Debugger) symbols can be matched
      with the slot file.

      We feel that this release makes our X.25/X.75 product stronger than ever
   and are looking forward to smooth implementation and tremendous customer
   satisfaction!

                       Users of X.25 CODE VERSION 3.01
             should be aware that the Extended DDT HELP command  
      lists some new Diagnostic features that should be used with care.


   The X.25 (Version 3.01) extended DDT HELP command gives the following menu:

   -->help

   HELP  Prints this list             QUIT   Returns to DDT

   SELECT Diagnostic selection        REDO   Repeat selection
   SNAP  One-shot selection
   DMY1  Spare Diagnostic             DMY2   Spare Diagnostic

   00xxx = CRAT, address of the Crash Table.


   Choosing the SELECT command gives the following message:

   -->select

   Select routines from the following list:

   PB     Packet buffer trace         PT     Packet trace
   FT     Frame trace                 BHN    Non-empty dump in hex

   OS     Output sector trace
   DMY1   Spare Diagnostic            DMY2   Spare Diagnostic

      The labels DMY1 and DMY2 are provided so technical people can write 
   their own diagnostic routines and include them with the label DMY1 or 
   DMY2 in the patch area.  Do not choose them unless you have defined them.

      The SELECT, REDO and SNAP commands were designed to make real-time
   monitoring of the system easier.  The REDO and SNAP commands are intended 
   to repeat the series of diagnostic commands chosen in SELECT command.  
   Using REDO or SNAP without a prior valid SELECT command may cause 
   unpredictable results.  Use of DMY1 or DMY2 after the SELECT command will 
   also cause unpredictable results unless they have been defined in the patch
   area, or unless they are included with other valid commands, in which case
   they will be ignored.

      Be careful that the commands that are typed to be included in the SELECT
   command are typed correctly and are valid commands.

   SLOT CRASHES HAVE OCCURRED BECAUSE OF INCORRECT USE OF REDO, SNAP, DMY1 AND
   DMY2 COMMANDS.

      The X.25/X.75 FIELD GUIDE, revised Aug. 18, 1984 describes the use of 
   SELECT, SNAP and REDO in Section 16.8 starting on page 16-15.

Written by : Ping Chu, SDLC Support Consultant
      Date : July 30, 1985




      This memo serves to inform you that our SDLC Interfaces do not zap
   the permanent virtual circuit (PVC) for no reason.  When you notice the
   CIRCUIT ZAPPED message when using the LOGTABLE command of the SDLC monitor,
   it may be issued for any one of the following reasons.



      Under the following circumstances, the SDLC interface will send an ISIS
   message "9E" DETACH to detach a permanent virtual circuit.


          1.  The DSR signal dropped on the  line  between  Front  End
              Processor and the SDLC Host Interface.

          2.  A monitor user entered the SHUT command for  a  specific
              station  via  the monitor host co-residing with the SDLC
              Host Interface.

          3.  A moniotr user entered the SHUT command to shut the host
              line via the monitor host co-residing with the SDLC Host
              Interface.

          4.  The SDLC Host Interface has used up  all  its  available
              ports  and  reports  the HOST OUT OF PORT message to the
              supervisor.  The Host Interface will not honor  any  new
              needle  requests  and  it  shall  detach the new circuit
              which exists because of the new needle request.

          5.  The SDLC Host interface sends the SELECT DIALECT command
              -  8080, but the SELECT DIALECT response - 8081 does not
              come back  from  the  Terminal  Interface  to  the  Host
              Interface  in  time.  The Host Interface will not accept
              this user's needle request.  It would also  detach  this
              circuit.

          6.  When the Host  Interface  receives  a  ZAPPER  from  the
              network,  it  will unconditionally send a DETACH message
              for this circuit.

          7.  When the Host Interface receives a "C089" CALL USER DATA
              and  it  finds  out that the control unit's address does
              not match with the PU address gened in the tymfile.

          8.  The user tries to logon to the monitor host, but his/her
              name is not on the GOODGUY list gened in the tymfile.

          9.  The second time the user uses the same username to logon
              to  the  monitor  host  while the first circuit is still
              intact.  The Interface  will  DETACH  the  second  logon
              request.

         10.  The user logs off the monitor host  by  typing  EXIT  or
              BYE.  This will cause the circuit being detached.

         11.  Upon receipt of an ISIS message "AE" BREAK (such as  the
              monitor  device  gets  powered off all of a sudden), the
              Interface will DETACH this circuit.



      Under the following situations the SDLC Interface will send an ISIS
   message "9F" ZAPPER to zap a permanent virtual circuit.


          1.  At the intialization time, the interfaces clear out  all
              the active circuits.

          2.  When the SDLC Terminal Interface receives an  ISIS  "B5"
              message  -  LOGON FAILURE, it will ZAP the corresponding
              circuit.

          3.  The SDLC Terminal Interface has already received a  real
              pseudo  needle  "B2"  from  the  Node  Code, but it then
              receives a spurious pseudo needle.   In  this  case,  it
              will zap the circuit to avoid confusion.

          4.  The DSR signal dropped on  the  line  between  the  SDLC
              Terminal Interface and the control unit.

          5.  A monitor user entered a SHUT  command  for  a  specific
              station  via  the monitor host co-residing with the SDLC
              Terminal Interface.

          6.  A monitor user entered a SHUT  command  for  a  terminal
              line  via  the  monitor  host  co-residing with the SDLC
              Terminal Interface.



      When the SDLC Host Interface recognizes the circuit being zapped, it 
   will:


          1.  release all the input bufferlets, output bufferlets  and
              the  command  link  lists  which  are  flowing  from the
              background processing to the  foreground.   Please  note
              that  whatever  data  sitting  in the SIO buffers remain
              intact.  In other words, the SIO motherboard will try to
              transmit whatever queued up in its SIO trasnmit buffer.

          2.  send an ISIS "9E"  DETACH  message  to  disconnect  this
              user.



      When the SDLC Terminal Interface recognizes the circuit being zapped,
   it will:


          1.  release all the input bufferlets, output bufferlets  and
              the  commad  link  lists  which  are  flowing  from  the
              background processing to the  foreground.   Please  note
              that  whatever  data  sitting  in the SIO buffers remain
              intact.  In other words, the SIO motherboard will try to
              transmit whatever queued up in its SIO transmit buffer.

          2.  increment the Logon Retry counter by one.

          3.  If we have not exceeded the limit of Logon Retry,  which
              presently is hardcoded to 16 times,

                      Then the Terminal Interface will wait until  the
                      PVCTIMER  to  timeout;   which is defined in the
                      tymfile.  After this timer pops,  it  starts  to
                      build  the  PVC  by  sending  the  pseudo needle
                      request again to the Node Code.



          4.  Otherwise;  the Terminal Interface reports  the  message
              of  EXCESSIVE  LOGON  RETRY to the supervisor's log, and
              shut off this station by clearing the circuit.

      An ISIS Consat can be built with upto 240 total async and SIO ports,
   until SEG2 overflows.  Without the PAD and with less than 240 ports the
   Consat will not have assembly errors or overflow segments.  The Consat with
   the PAD can easily overflow segments and the following table should be used
   as check to see if this will be a problem.  The table is not perfect and 
   not thoroughly tested, but will give a good approximation of memory usage.
   The Solo Consat has been built with 256 async ports without any problems.

      The following is the memory required by an ISIS Consat.

   OPTION          SEG 0           SEG 1           SEG 2
   ------          --------        -------         ------- 
   Base            1292            14000           2180
   Async port      115 /prt        12.5 /prt       256 /prt
   SIO             590 + 559 /prt  2020 + 10 /prt  256 /prt
   Printer         1036 /prt       780             0
   MPVC            560 + 104/prt   1956 + 32 /prt  256 /prt
   ALO             0               50 /prt         0
   Telex           808             1364
   Telexb          92              2768            0
   PVC             828             2320            0
   PAD             4000? + ?       29000? + ?      0
   HD202           0               464             0


   NOTE: The figure for the PAD is for 14 ports with all of the options
         on.

   Example.  The memory requirements for an isis consat with 64 async ports,
   16 PVC ports, 4 ALO ports, 2 SIO ports and 4 Telex ports would be:

   OPTION          SEG 0           SEG 1           SEG 2
   ------          --------        -------         ------- 
   Base            1292            14000           2180
   64 async        115*64          12.5*64         256*64
   16 PVC          828             2320            0
   2 SIO           590 + 559*2     2020 + 10*2     256*2
   4 Telex         808             1364            0
   4 ALO         +   0           + 50 * 4        + 0
                -------         ---------       ---------
                   11896           22524           19076 bytes

   So this consat would require around 11896 + 22524 + 19076 = 53496 bytes, or
   about 54k.

       BETA TEST OF SNA/CMT LU3 SEPERATELY ADDRESSABLE PRINTER SUPPORT
       ---------------------------------------------------------------
       ---------------------------------------------------------------


Written by : Gordon Smith
      Date : August 7, 1985




      We're looking for beta test customers for our new async-to-3270 SNA/SDLC
   LU3 separately addressable printer support.  The target start date is
   mid-October 1985.  Approximately 5 test slots will be available between 
   then and the end of the year.


   Things to Know

   1. This is LU3 printer support not LU1.  There is a big difference.  LU3 is
   the simplier of the two.  It supports 3270 data stream printers.  LU1 
   supports the more sophisticated SNA Character String (SCS) data stream 
   which is used by some 3270 applications.  If your customer needs LU1 please
   let me know.  We plan to support this in the future, but we need more 
   information about its relative priority.

   2. For the beta test period, we will waive SHI-3270S and TEM-CMTS monthly 
   and installation charges.  Customer will pay for everything else, including
   the network connection, usage charges, and account charge.

   3. AFTER your request is accepted by HQ, you will need to have your 
   customer sign the Beta Test Agreement.

   4. All character mode (CMT) terminals and PC terminal emulation packages 
   that are currently supported by our async-to-3270 BSC separately address-
   able printer support service (in Full Release) can be used with the new 
   SNA/SDLC service.

   5. The printers are AUX port attached to the PC or terminal.  ASCII serial
   printers used with either the BSC or SNA/SDLC service must support CR, LF,
   and FF commands and have enough column positions to support the customer's
   application, i.e., the printer must be able to print 132 character lines if
   the application requires this.  Also, make sure that the cabling used to 
   attach the printer to the terminal/PC is right.  In particular, make sure
   that the flow control signalling between the devices is compatible.

   6. Our async-to-3270 SNA/SDLC service for display stations only is 
   currently in limited release.  We expect full release to occur no earlier 
   than mid-4th QTR 85.


   TO Submit a Request

   Send me an Ontyme with the following info:

   1.The business case.  How much money is involved?  What business advantage
   will be obtained if we accept this customer?

   2. Customer equipment.  Terminals/PCs and printers they will use.  What 
   kind of host, front end, teleprocessing access method (e.g., VTAM, TCAM), 
   application system (e.g., IMS, CICS, TSO)?

   3. Customer technical expertise and willingness to help us with the test.

   4. Local Tymnet support expertise.  This is very important!! Your Ontyme 
   should include a statement from your Regional Technical Manager naming the
   CC who will be assigned, describing his/her technical expertise (training,
   experience), and the amount of his/her time that can be allocated to
   supporting your customer.  Copy your RTM on your request Ontyme.

                             HOW TO GET A DUMP
                             -----------------
                             -----------------


Written by : Technical Services




      This document describes, briefly, how to get a dump of Tymnet Engine
   Node Code for the purpose of isolating a problem condition.  The user must
   be familiar with the use of LOADII and NAD.  As such, the target audience 
   is Tymnet technical personell such as Network Controllers, Field Engineers
   and Communication Consultants, and HQ Network Quality and Technical Support
   personnel.  

      Two important steps are described.

      First, a dump must be obtained using LOADII.  This is described for an
   ISIS node and for a SOLO node.

      Second, the current Symbols must be appended to the dump file.  It is
   important that these Symbols be drawn from the disk images which were 
   running on the machine at the time of the dump operation.


   I.  Obtaining a dump file.

       A).  ISIS node slot 0; use the LOADII utility to Dump from locations
       indicated in the node map which was printed out during the merge and
       link process for the node.  This MERLIN map will also be NECESSARY in
       reading the dump after it is taken.  It may be necessary to run MERLIN
       again to obtain this map if it is not available  from the original 
       merge and link process.  The MERLIN map will resemble the one shown
       below.
    
                 SLOT MAP    
              
       SLOT BEGINS ENDS
        0   1D400  5BC00
        1   5BC00  647FF
        2   64800  6D3FF
        3   6D400  75FFF


           MAP OF SLOT  0

       SEG  BEGINS ENDS
        0   1E400  2B4FF
        1   2B500  378FF
        2   37900  478FF
        3   47900  48FFF
        6   49000  4F7FF
       11   4F800  510FF
       12   51100  547FF
       13   54800  5BBFF
       14   1D400  1E3FF

      Notice that since this is an ISIS  node, segment 4 is not used.  Seg 4
   is currently used for the Solo Consat code.  Notice also that this machine
   has been assembled with Kernel code and Node Code only, and that Seg 14 
   (Seg E), the Control Table Area, has been assembled first in the Node Code
   area.

      In this case you would use the hex values for slot 0 for the LOADII dump
   address parameters.  These would be $0 1D400 to $0 5BC00.
              

       B).  SOLO node; use a range equivalent to the approximate size of
       the machine to be dumped.  One thousand hex bytes ( $0 10000 ) is
       equal to 64K decimal bytes of memory.  Therefore, for a 256K byte
       machine $0 0 to $0 3FFFE will dump the whole machine.
   


                     Tymnet-II Node Code Crash Analysis 
                       


   II.  Appending the symbol table to the dump file.

      The dump file as obtained from LOADII will not contain symbolic refer-
   ences.  These symbolic refernces may be extracted from the disk image and
   appended to the dump information.  Assume the disk image is called 
   "FILE.NIB" and the dump is called  FILE.DMP.  The following commands run in
   NAD will append the symbolic information to the dump information.

           -R NAD
           %FFILE.NIB<cr>
           %G
           1%FFILE.DMP<cr>
           %P%Q
           -

      If the NIB file is on a different system than the DMP file, a separate
   symbol file may be created using the same commands and this symbol file may
   be transferred to another system and appended to the DMP  file there.  An
   example is shown below using NAD  and the TELECOPY utility.

           -R NAD
           %FFILE.NIB<cr>
           %G
           1%FILE.SYM<cr>
           %P%Q

           -R TELECOPY
           :(DIRECTORY:70)FILE.SYM,(DIRECTORY:39)FILE.SYM<cr>
           -       
        
           -R NAD
           %FFILE.SYM<cr>
           %G
           1%FFILE.DMP<cr>
           %P%Q
           -

      Enabling the statement "2[PATCH1:" can cause problems in XCOM versions 
   other than Version 2.01.

      The Sample Command File for XCOM Version 2.01 includes the following 
   statements:

           ;;USE THE FOLLOWING SWITCH ONLY IF SEG 1 OVERFLOW OCCURS
           ;;2[PATCH1:

      These 2 lines are not in the sample command file for later versions and
   SHOULD NOT BE USED IN LATER VERSIONS.

      They should have been used only in Version 2.01, and then only when the
   Patch File itself caused the overflow.  The purpose of the 2[PATCH1: 
   statement in Version 2.01 is to prevent the possibility of the Patch File 
   starting in Seg 1 and overflowing into Seg 2.

      If "2[PATCH1:" is enabled in Version 3.00, the error statement
           ERROR **** BAD CONPATCH(PA1PTR,,xx) <<<<
   will be found whenever a patch has more than 1 ENDPATCH statement.

      Protection errors have been noted and there have been crashes when this
   code has been loaded.

      IT WOULD BE WISE TO REMOVE

          ;;USE THE FOLLOWING SWITCH ONLY IF SEG 1 OVERFLOW OCCURS
          ;;2[PATCH1:

      IF THESE STATEMENTS HAVE MIGRATED TO VERSION 2.02, 3.00 OR 3.01.

      It would also seem wise not to copy over a command file when changing
   from one version to another without first checking the Sample Command File
   for the new version for any significant differences.

****************************************************************************
**     IMPORTANT:  ATC ORDER INFORMATION FOR THE PUBLIC NETWORK           **
****************************************************************************


      I would like to clarify some details regarding the bundling of items in 
   the ATC service for Public Networks.  Because the ATC is a bundled service, 
   it consists of several items included under one pricing structure.  A 
   typical order for an ATC would include the following components, all under
   the standard price:

           Item:  ATC-8 service
           =======================

           Components: (1) Network Connection, consisting of
                           a) 1 pair synch 4800 bps modems
                           b) 1 leased line, up to 50 miles from Tymnet
                              Service Office (TSO) to the ATC site
                           c) Dataset cable to hook the ATC site modem to
                              the ATC 
                       (1) ATC box, here an 8 port version
                       (8) dataset cables for connection of the ATC to
                           terminals

           Total cost: $1000/month     $900 installation fee



      Because site conditions may vary, we have established default lengths
   and sexes for the cables.  These are:


       Item                                            Part number
       ============================================    =================

       1 synch cable to hook ATC site modem to ATC,
       length = 15 feet, gender = plug-to-plug        
       (male-to-male)                                  160110-058

       Cables to hook ATC to the terminals. Each
       ATC-to-terminal connection is: 

         i) 1 straight cable, length = 25 feet,
            gender = plug-to-plug (male-to-male)       160110-062

       If connecting the ATC to an asynch modem, 
       then add:

        ii) 1 crossover cable, length = 6 inches,
            gender = plug-to-jack (male-to-female)     160110-105

      Because these are the default cables, they will be included automatic-
   ally with the order, based on information you supply on the Order Infor-
   mation screen.

      Not all terminal-to-ATC connections will use the type of straight cables
   and crossovers listed here.  Therefore, IT IS IMPERATIVE that the Field
   Engineer or C.C. determines, PRIOR TO ORDER PLACEMENT, that the default 
   cables can be used.  If different lengths/sexes/cables are required, this 
   information MUST be specified on the ATC Order Information screen, under 
   the comment section.  Also, please be certain to specify whether the 
   external power source will be 110 or 220 Volts, as the ATC box and Micro-
   engine have different part numbers for each voltage level.  We DO NOT 
   CHARGE EXTRA for these types of changes within the bundling of the ATC 
   service.

      Naturally, if other items are added, such as High Speed Network Con-
   nection, these are itemized at additional cost as specified in the Rate 
   Schedule.

      I hope this will help to avoid confusion when ordering this service.

      All requests which alter the configuration of the network -- such as, 
   reducing the number of pass-through circuits available for a particular

      System 37's storage MUST be kept in check at all times!!

      The system is repeatedly running out of room.

      Please do not wait for operators or HQ to remind you to clean up your
   directories.

      Make it a point to get your customers to be conscientious about storage
   too.

      While we plan to offload a large net from 37 to 26 in the next few
   weeks -- that will not mean we can still be lax on keeping directories 
   lean.  If you want your customer to have room to grow - and want room to
   install new customers, clean it up now !!!  and keep it clean !!!

      The use of Micro Tempus Tempus-Link software with Tymnet's CMTI inter-
   face will require a signed beta test agreement until further notice.  If 
   you have a customer who is currently running Tempus-Link with a protocol 
   converter and they are interested in being a beta test site please contact
   me and I will check with all interested parties here at Tymnet and with 
   Micro Tempus who must also concur on any new beta sites.
 
      At the present time there is only 1 beta site and they have had a string
   of problems.  The good news is that none of these problems have been caused
   by Tymnet.

      As you can see, the basic menu has not changed very much.  The following
   features have been added in version 1.07.  The main advantage for most of 
   you is the ability to perform a more complete async to 3270 login.

      I encourage all of you to obtain permission from your customers to 
   upgrade the code.



      The new features in version 1.07 are:
        1.  After welcome message, strike space bar becomes optional.
        2.  Circuit gouging level is optional.  The gouging level can
            be sent to destination host either by cammand string or
            default - user login's gouging level.
        3.  A logoff message can be displayed when user exits.
        4.  Menu item name can be up to 9 characters instead of 1 character.
        5.  The user login data can be sent to destination host one
            by one when it sees appropriate reponse.
        6.  Manual login optional.  Besides programmed menu items,
            user can manually login a destination host thru Menu Service.

      NTD has agreed to maintain release 2.01 XCOM in source directory until
   11/30/85, i.e. 3 more months.

      If you are currently running this release, you are best advised to begin
   now in planning to upgrade to either release 2.02 or 3.01.  3.01 is 
   slightly preferable to 2.02 because it will be around for a lot longer.

      Please call if any questions/probelms.

      Two shared files have been (or will soon be) created for keeping all of
   us informed about MENU problems, delights, etc.  They are:

      ** ALLMENU
      ** ALLMENUSALES

      The ** allmenu file contains all HQ people involved. The ** allmenusales
   has all the field people currently involved in beta test.  Please use both
   of these files when communicating ANY NSR/BUG about the menu.  Please use 
   them as required.

      Note they are ** files.  Your account supervisor (TYM, ACS, TNAD, NSS, 
   NTD, TYMNFE) are placing these files in your respective accounts.  If they
   aren't active by 8/30, let me know.

      Thanks for your attention.

          LINK OVERLOADED/LINK OUT OF BANDWIDTH/LINE ERRORS IN XRAY
          ---------------------------------------------------------

                               LINK OVERLOADED  
     
   Error log message type 98 subtype 0.    
     
   This message is sent to the Supervisor when the node detects the link over-
   load condition to the indicated neighbour during the last minute.  The node
   code keeps track of the number of times during the last minute that all 
   channels on the link with output data could not be serviced by RMAKE at 
   least once every half a second. If this count exceeds a threshold (default=
   10) in the last minute then an overlaod condition is flagged.  
     

                            LINK OUT OF BANDWIDTH 
     
   Error log message type 98 subtype 6.    
     
   Every time a line completes transmitting a packet and another packet is 
   immediately ready to be transmitted, the conditon is flagged. If this 
   occurs consistently for half a second, the "saturated" counter is 
   incremented by one.  120 half second intervals are checked in this manner.
   i.e. for one minute period.  After this one minute period, if the 
   "saturated" counter exceeds a threshold (default=70), the link is reported
   as "link out of bandwidth". A probe node snap will indicate "ov" at the 
   same time and, after the condition is relieved, the message "LINK 
   UNOVERLOADED" will appear in the probe log.  Network backpressure does not
   affect the above since packets are not built under backpressure conditions.
   Window size also has no effect and is primarily concerned with retrans-
   missions due to delays in receipt of packet acknowledgements.   
     

                             LINE ERRORS IN XRAY   
     
   The line error rate in XRAY is an approximate indication of the incidence 
   of errors on the line during the last hour.  If the error rate field is 
   blank the line has been essentially (may not be completely) error-free. 
   '*' to '****' indicate low error rate to high error rate.  The errors 
   covered by this indicator are those reported in the crypto log,  messages 
   41 to 4B.  Please refer to XRAY manual.    
     
   This is an approximate presentation of how the number of stars in the error
   rate field is determined.
     
   There is a halfword bit array reserved to indicate the error rate on the 
   line.  Approximately every 4 minutes a new bit is set or reset depending on
   whether the number of errors in that period is more or less than a certain 
   threshold.  This halfword is maintained such that it always contains the 
   number of bits set during only the last 60 minutes from the time the 'nd' 
   command was issued.  The number of stars to be displayed is calculated by 
   dividing the number of 1 bits in the halfword by 4.  Therefore if during 
   the last hour all 16 bits were set then an error rate of '****' is 
   indicated.  This would then mean that errors were continuously occuring 
   during the last hour.

Standard Engine.        ECO# 85-418  
     
Perform the following rework. 
     
1. Remove jumper from CPU Backplane 204-0 Slot 0 and DMA Backplane 204-0   
Slot 7.   
     
Note: Removing the jumper disconnects ER0 from the DMA Backplane.
     
     
MAC II Board.  Tymnet Part Number 470109-001.
     
Perform the following rework. 
     
1. Add 220ohm resistor, 1/4 watt 5% (Tymnet Part Number 300002-122) between
   IC location U175-2 and U175-16.

Field Trial Rework.     Standard Engine.    
     
ECO# 85-462                     (RAS-TIME change on MEMORY board.)  
     
Rework applies to as follows: 
     
1. 420147-001 A/W Rev. C        Note apply 480147-001 Rev. B before Rev. C   
2. 450147-001 FAB Rev. C 
     
*** You MUST remove experimental ECO# 85-416 if applied to the board FIRST.
     
Reason: The rework moves RAS generation on to memory cycle latch, to  
        ensure no instability of RAS pulse due to characteristics of    
        start R/W latch. This rework will apply to all memory boards.   
     
Rework instructions:
     
1. CUTS: Trace at U208-05 (solder side). The same trace should also be
   cut at the FEEDTHRU (Near U205-pins 4&5) to eliminate antenna effect.   
     
2. WIRES: Add 3 jumper wires as follows:
     
        FROM            TO 
        ========        ========  
        U225-06         U211-01   
        U201-08         U211-02

========================================================================   
     
At this time the following deployment restrictions apply:   
     
 TELEVERKET    
     
        May be installed into all engines with XPI cards.
     
 HSBC
     
        Limited to 6 engines. NTS strongly suggests that nodes 2042 and 
        2052 be among the selected nodes. 
     
 TRW 
     
        Limited to 2001, 2002, 2012, 2013. One addtional node can be added   
        to the list if failure history warrants.    
     
 PUBLIC NET    
     
        All sups (ONLY IF REQUESTED BY NTD), and 4 addtional engines    
        to be selected with HQTECH.

      It has come to my attention that there are at least 8 unauthorized
   customer sites running Version 1.11 of SDLC Software.  Autostrade is the
   only accepted beta test site for SDLC.

      Escalations associated with unauthorized beta test software will be
   rejected.  Sites running unauthorized software are requested to de-install
   and move to a supported full release version of code and if beta test code
   is needed, request beta test approval from Product Marketing.

      The beta test procedures are available on (*** Beta.TST) in OnTyme.  A
   list of full release products is generated monthly by Quality Assurance and
   distributed to ALLSALES/TECH.

      As many of you know, Telenet has recently announced their version of
   X.32 for publicly shared dial-up X.25 terminal access to a PDN.
 
      Several of you have called asking about Tymnet's response to this.  I 
   just wanted to let you know the current status.
 
      X.32 has not been completely formalized as a recommendation by CCITT.  
   As such Tymnet does not have a current product that uses the existing draft
   of the X.32 recommendations, nor do we plan to have a product in the near 
   future.  We are currently investigating the market viability of this 
   product.  Feedback on demand or customers using Telenet's service is 
   valuable.  Please let me know.
 
      Telenet's deployment is currently only in 7 cities, so they will not be
   able to offer it to a wide audience.
 
      If you get into a competitive situation, please make sure to use X.PC as
   a weapon.  X.PC provides most of the same benefits as X.32, but at a 
   significantly lower cost to the user.  The user does not have to purchase 
   expensive sync modems, interface cards for the PC or packet mode terminals.
   See Steve Kim for more details.
 
      If you have any information, gossip, customer requests, feedback, etc. 
   on dial-up X.25 and Telenet's service, please make sure you tell me.  Your
   help is essential to providing our customers with a cost-effective, well 
   positioned service to meet their needs.

      The symbols that are missing from the NIB file are all symbols from pro-
   prietary code.  They are not output due to a feature which was added to NAD
   a few years ago.  

      The following is a memo describing the feature.

                                ************


      A new version of NAD (021482) is available which allows customers to 
   assemble Engine code which consists of both Tymshare proprietary code and
   customer code without the Tymshare code being seen.  The protection will 
   only affect users without Tymshare license.  To users with Tymshare license
   this release will seem no different from the previous version.

      For users without Tymshare license, the restrictions listed below will
   only apply to files which reside in the same directory as the NAD low core
   and share files. This will likely be the SOURCE directory.  Nad will be 
   installed in this directory with home file license.  This will permit the 
   customer to access the proprietary files via NAD and not directly.  NAD 
   will limit the visability of the these files such that a user can only 
   assemble them.

      The following are the limitations NAD places on the visability of the 
   proprietary source code.

      1.  The most significant restriction  is  that  listing
          files  will  not  be  produced  for any proprietary
          file.  In the following, proprietary file will mean
          any  file  the resides in the same directory as NAD
          and  customer  file  will  mean  any  other   file.
          Neither  pass  one,  pass  two  nor cross reference
          listings will be produced.   No  restrictions  will
          exist  for customer files.  A multiple file listing
          will simple not contain the proprietary source.

      2.  In the debugger, no symbols which were defined in a
          proprietary  file  will  be displayed by NAD.  This
          applies to all commands which display  instructions
          in  memory such as right bracket and back slash and
          which print the symbolic value of a  location  such
          as  underscore.  The value of any symbol will still
          be available so that if a customer knows  the  name
          of  a  symbol  defined  in  a proprietary file, its
          value can be displayed.  Memory values  which  came
          from  proprietary  files can still be displayed but
          the values for address will either be numeric or an
          expression containing symbols from a customer file.

      3.  No symbols, except module names, which are  defined
          in  a  proprietary  file  will  be written to a NIB
          file.  Symbols which come from a NIB file  will  be
          treated  as  if  they  came  from customer files no
          matter from which directory they came.

      4.  Assemble errors  for  proprietary  files  will  not
          print  the  source  line  or  label where the error
          occurred.  Only the line numner and  error  message
          will print.

      5.  There will be a distinction between proprietary and
          customer  macros  which  will be used in assembling
          the REMARK directive.  A proprietary macro  is  any
          macro  defined  in  a  proprietary  file  or  in  a
          proprietary macro.  A customer macro is  any  other
          macro.  A REMARK directive in a customer macro will
          not print any source from  a  proprietary  file  or
          proprietary  macro.   This  restriction  forbids  a
          customer from using a set of macros of the form

               opcode MACRO[ REMARK %opcode; REMARK ]

          where opcode is a Engine instruction code, to  list
          proprietary source at the terminal.

      Good News!!!  Async-to-3270 SNA/SDLC Limited Release is re-opened for 
   4th QTR 85.  We are looking for 15 more limited release customers.


      To submit a request, send me an Ontyme with the following info:

   1) Business Case.  Who is the customer?  How much money is involved?  What
   business advantage do we obtain by accepting them?

   2) Customer Equipment.  What terminal/PC and host system will they be 
   using?  Include info on front end processor type, access method (VTAM,TCAM)
   application system (CICS, TSO, IMS, ...)

   3) Customer technical expertise and willingness to help us diagnosis 
   problems that may occur.

   4) Tymnet technical support.  Who is the CC who will support them.  What 
   training/experience have they had with SNA/SDLC?



   Other things you should know:

   * DO NOT enter an order before you are accepted.  (If you do, the order 
   will be put on hold and we will be very disaggreeable to deal with.)  
   Requests submitted with all the required info will be responded to within 
   one week.

   * Preferance will be given to new revenue producing business, i.e., try to
   defer Bisync to SNA/SDLC upgrades for a few more months.  Preference will
   also be given to sales offices with CCs who have experience and training
   with SNA/SDLC.

   * This service supports CMT character mode CRT terminals and PCs only.  Not
   seperately addressable printers or block mode terminals.

   * Full release for this service is targeted for January 1986.  Orders will 
   NOT be accepted for full release until later this year.  I'll let you know

File Location :  (*6NEWS:39)DUSAGE.DOC
         Date :  March, 1, 1983




   DUSAGE V. 2.0


   General:

      After a series of requests for user input, DUSAGE will create a file
   containing a list of user names and/or a disk usage report.  The requests 
   are structured to accept responses, each consisting of a keyword, CR, "?",
   or "HELP".  With the exception of the filename or date response, left-
   oriented substrings of the acceptable response are permissible; for 
   example, H, HE, or HEL for the response "HELP".


   User Inputs:

   DUSAGE initially offers a help message:

           Type ? or 'HELP' for a help message
           ( ?, help or CR )[ no help ] :

      If the user asks for help, a help message will be printed describing the
   system of prompts and expected user inputs.

      With each remaining prompt, the user will choose between two keywords
   (and "?" or "HELP").  The default response, CR, gives the keyword or action
   given in the square brackets.  A help message specific for each prompt will 
   be available if requested by the user, following which the prompt is 
   repeated.

      After a verification of user license, DUSAGE will ask for the following
   information from the user:

           What do you wish to report?
           ( usernames or diskusage )[ diskusage ] :

      If the user selects usernames, a list will be prepared containing names
   from the DUL.  The next prompt will ask whether an alphabetic sort on user
   name should be performed.  The diskusage option is offered again after the
   username file has been created.

           Sort the names?
           ( yes or no )[ no ] :

      The file DUSAGE.TXT, optionally sorted, is created.  The user may exit
   the program or continue for a diskusage report with the next prompt.

           Get diskusage or exit?
           ( diskusage or exit )[ exit ] :

      If the user requests the Diskusage report, then the prompts will 
   continue with:

           Give a file name for use in DUSAGE.RPT, if desired
           ( filename or CR )[ all names ] :

      The file, if specified, should contain one user name per line.  If none
   is supplied, DUSAGE will read from the DUL.  If the file specified is the
   current program version of DUSAGE.TXT, the user names will be taken from 
   the DUL since this is quicker.  Finally, the prompt will be repeated if an
   illegal file name is supplied.

      The output file will be called DUSAGE.RPT.  Each time DUSAGE is run,
   DUSAGE.RPT will be overwritten.

           Sort by size or username:
           ( size or usernames )[ username ] :

      The size option causes the report to be sorted by total disk storage, 
   with the largest first.  The username option causes an alphabetic sort on
   the user name.  If sorting by size, the user can restrict the report to the
   top N users by entering a number N to the following question.

           Number of users to report?
           ( 'number' or all )[ all ] :

      DUSAGE will ask whether to report disk storage size for "old" files 
   using the following prompt:

           Last access date for old files?
           ( dd mon yr or CR )[ 1 JAN 64 ] :

      An "old" file is one which has not been accessed after a given date.  A
   date should be entered here to request reporting of "old" files and to
   define what an "old" file is.  Note:  Specifiying a date will require that
   the program perform additional work and will take a considerably longer 
   time.


   Program Output:

      The output file, DUSAGE.TXT, is a text file containing the list of
   usernames, one per line and sorted alphabetically if requested.

      The output file, DUSAGE.RPT, will consist of a header followed by one
   line of information for each user name.  Each line will contain the user
   name, the total disk space for that user, the total disk space from the
   last run of DUSAGE and the difference between the total disk space used in
   the current run and the last run("-----" if not available), and the total
   disk space for "old" files (if requested).

      The output file, DUSAGE.DAT, is a binary file consisting of a set of 
   two-word entries, one for each user.  The first word of each entry contains
   the user's PPN, and second word contains the corresponding size of the user
   account in pages.  Storage data on all the names in the last selection is 
   retained regardless of whether the report was limited to the top N users.



   Example:

                        DISK USAGE REPORT
                          Gan Number : 3
   
   Previous Run Date & Time :   7 SEP 82   12:00
   Present Run Date & Time  :  21 SEP 82   10:00
   Old File Date 82         :  30 JUN 82

     The following pseudo license names have been defined to represent groups
   of commonly set licenses in OPER:

   X (775617,18,35,ALL)   ; everything thats defined 
   X (371416,18,35,MOST)  ; RC OP SY GD TD JL AC RA WF

   X (240014,18,35,READ)  ; RC SY RA
   
      If you specify more than you have you will get the minimum of what you
   specify and what you have - therefor GOD will give you all you have no 
   matter what it is.

      Note, the following abbreviation may be used if your OPER name is the
   same as your current login name: end the command line with an escape 
   (or ^D) and immediately type your password.  This provides an added bonus 
   because the control-character forces deffered echo mode so your password is
   guarenteed not to echo.  Also, note that an O followed immediately by an 
   escape will also default the license set to all licenses associated with 
   your OPER name.

      We have acquired a fourth KL for public network code management.  The 
   resulting four systems will be paired as follows:
 
         D25/C70       Primary/Backup     nodes below Nxxxx
         D54/C33       Primary/Backup     nodes Nxxxx and above
 
      Additionally, to make better use of the available CPU on backups:  
   A)  C70 will be used by Management Sciences,  on an ad hoc basis, to catch
   up on Netstat/P-Grade;  B)  C33 will be used by Payment Services as their 
   primary system for development (currently being done on C33).
 
      We are obtaining projected growth figures for the public network to 
   determine the best node number to use as the cut-off between the two pairs
   - realizing that one pair will be static,  and the other will experience 
   all the growth.
 
      The tentative target date for implementation of this project is 
   November 4, 1985.
 
      This is a perfect opportunity to thoroughly clean up systems 25, 33 and
   70.  Here is how we plan to do it:
 
 
      Remember that now everyone will have to be validated on all four 
   systems.  To ensure that only those who really need to be on these hosts 
   are there, you must submit to me, by Friday, October 4, a complete list of
   all usernames which need to be validated on system 54.  This request should
   be in the form of a memo, detailing by username, the tru/storage require-
   ments and any other pertinent information.  (Do not use the online 
   validation forms for this project.)   Using these lists,  we will do a  
   comparison on the other 3 systems and make sure everyone is properly set
   up.  Any username which appears on 25/33/70 which we were NOT requested to
   validate on 54, will be moved or removed.
 
      In the course of discussions the point was raised about the field 
   building aux circuits from system to system, rather than logging off one 
   and onto the other.  While this may seem convenient to the user, it is 
   terribly wasteful and can be expensive.  Please discourage your CCs from 
   this activity.  It only takes a few extra seconds to log off and log onto 
   another system.
 
      This project will, of course, impact the way Backup Requests will be  
   handled.  Beryl Agua will be working out the details of new procedures and
   advise you in mid-October.  The end result should be a faster turnaround, 
   since the amount of necessary telecopying should greatly diminish.
 
      I will keep you posted along the way of progress being made and 
   appreciate (in advance) your cooperation in ensuring that this project is
   successfully implemented.  For now, please start submitting those lists of
   usernames to be validated on D54.

      The feedback we have received following our Xpedite field training 
   classes as well as our presentations and discussions at THUGS has been very
   positive.  The purpose of this memo is to bring you up to date on current 
   status and to keep our momentum going!
 
      As you are all now aware, the Xpedite Service plays a significant role 
   in our plans for 1986 and beyond.  It is a logical extension of our product
   line and value-added capabilities, and promotes increased traffic and 
   revenues on the Public Network.  It gives you an extra "hook" to attract 
   and keep customers.  And, it provides you revenue credit at a multiple of 
   standard Public Net rates.

                                   -------
 
      So where do we stand?
 
      There have been many significant developments since the sales training 
   classes.  We have made some very positive progress, and also have some 
   changes to our original schedule of which you should be aware.
 
      Xpedite has been receiving a lot of press lately, and Bill Erysian and 
   Lori Waggener have been tracking it for the press book update.  Significant 
   articles have been in Communications Week, PC Week, Data Channels, and EM 
   World.  It is a unique concept, and the press is picking up on that.  
   However, we don't want to overload the press until closer to the launch 
   date.
 
      As of September 15, we are not yet installing dataDRIVER 100 units. Due
   to changes in the schedule of the software development on the dataDRIVER 
   units, the units will not be ready for Tymnet QA testing until October 15.
   As a result, field test installations will begin November 15.
 
      On the positive side, each field office has been equipped with two 
   dataDRIVER 200 units for demonstration purposes.  Bob Fultz is coordinating
   installations and will be providing all necessary software and instructions 
   by the end of September.  These units should be used to keep up the 
   interest level in your prospects.
 
      The feedback we have been receiving from you is very upbeat.  Many of 
   our customers are excited about the technology and require some help with 
   the applications.  To provide our sales force with applications help, 
   Telentry has reorganized their marketing and sales organization to focus on
   exactly those questions.  Look for more and better customer stories soon!
 
      We have a direct mail piece going out at the end of this month.  The 
   piece is very good and should generate a significant number of leads.  Each
   field office will receive a copy.
 
      So keep in touch with those prospects and suspects.  We are working very
   closely with Telentry to provide you with the information you need.  Please
   communicate any and all customer feedback, reactions, etc.  or any 
   suggestions you may have as soon as you can to Bob Fultz.
 
      Thanks for your support and enthusiasm.  A detailed schedule of support
   activities and materials will be published within the next two weeks.

      The CMTI ERS has been released for version 3.00 of CMTI which is
   now in Betatest.

      The document has been split into 2 documents.  The first is called
   CMTI.ERS and contains all of former information except the terminal
   information.

      The 2nd document which does contain the terminal descriptions is 
   called CMTERM.ERS.

      Both documents reside on DNDSPEC.

      New features include the Status Line, the Operations Monitor, the
   Concept 108 terminal, and some miscellaneous descriptions.

      There is also a section on how to upgrade to version 3.00.
      
      Report any discrepancies or ommissions to NTD.

      Due to the fact that there are no KNOWN customers using versions 5.04
   and 5.05 of the 3270 BSC TIF (PBT) they will be removed from the BETATEST
   directory on October 14th, 1985.  This will leave version 6.0 as the
   only betatest version of this code.  If there are any customers using
   5.04 or 5.05, they must be moved to either the BASELINE version or to
   version 6.0.  Currently the only customers using version 6.0 are Southwest
   Bell (soon to be using) and McAuto.

      If you have a PRIVATE NETWORK customer who wants to use version 6.0,
   you need to contact me in order to set up a betatest.

      If there are any questions or problems, please contact me.

                NEW FEATURES IN 3270/CMT READY FOR BETA TEST
                --------------------------------------------
                --------------------------------------------


Written by : Mary Chalmers

      A new version of beta test code has been released for 3270/CMT.  The new
   version is 3.00 and has two new important features--3270 Status Line 
   emulation and an Operations monitor .  If you have customers who have 
   Bisync Host interfaces and CMT slots and are interested in being beta sites
   you should contact myself with pre-beta installation information and I will
   contact HQQA for their approval.  The Status Line is not avialable for use
   with the SNA 3270 Host Interface at this time.
 
   1.  Operations Monitor--will give CC's lots of new tools to help them 
   trouble shoot problems.
 
   2.  Emulation of the 3270's 25th Status Line--gives the end user infor-
   mation about the status of their Tymnet and IBM host sessions just like a 
   real 3270.  Tymnet's Status Line will use character symbols, discussed 
   below, instead of the icons seen on real 3270's.
 
      The Status Line is under the end users control to be displayed or not
   displayed and can be presented on any line from 1 to 24 or the 25th line if
   the terminal can support it.  The information can be displayed in the upper
   right hand corner of the screen as an alternative to the line display.
 
      O.K. so what kind of information can the end user expect to see?
 
   a.  The kind of host interface--BSC,SNA,X.25
 
   b.  Printer Name--yes, this will be that long number you need in the demo 
       to get you seperately addressed attached printer to work.
 
   c.  Unavialable function  -f, yes just like a real 3270 when a user does 
       something that is a no, no.
 
   d.  WAIT will be seen when an aux port attached printer is printing.  
       Remember the terminal can not be used during aux port printing because
       of the current limitations of terminal equipment on the market today.
 
   e.  ISRT means that the terminal is in "insert mode"
 
   f.  PROT means that the cursor is in a protected field and must be moved to
       an unportected field before data can be input
 
   g.  NULK means that you are in a numeric only field--only numbers and the
       decimal (.) and minus sign (-) are allowed
 
   h.  LOCK means that keyboard is locked and the users must wait for the host
       to unlock it or must hit the "reset key" to unlock the keyboard.  And 
       remember that Tymnet gives the end user English language messages like
       "please log in:" instead of the lightning bolt to indicate the 
       "comminications check" condition.
 
      The technical documentation for these new features is in (DNDSPEC:39)

      TYMNET EXPANDS ITS 2400 DATA COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE TO INCLUDE 80
   MAJOR U.S. CITIES
 
      SAN JOSE, Calif., September 18, 1985 -- Tymnet, McDonnell Douglas Net-
   work Systems Company, announced it has further expanded its asynchronous 
   2400 bits per second (bps) dial-up data transmission service, bringing the
   total number of 2400 bps access cities to 80.  No other data network now 
   offers a comparable service.

      In these 80 cities, the service is available on a local call basis; 
   elsewhere in the U.S., via a WATS number.  Tymnet, which operates the 
   TYMNET (R) public data communication network, also offers asynchronous 
   300 bps and 1200 bps dial-up services in more than 540 U.S. cities.

      The high speed 2400 bps data transmission service enables network users
   to transmit data at twice the speed of 1200 bps at the same cost per hour,
   thereby cutting connect charges by as much as 50 percent.

      The service also makes it possible for users of personal computers and 
   asynchronous terminals, such as Digital's VT100, to access Tymnet's 3270 
   emulation services over the TYMNET network at speeds comparable to leased 
   lines, but at far lower cost.

      "In addition to improving application efficiency and providing signi-
   ficant cost savings, the 2400 bps dial-up service accommodates the trend in
   user requirements toward higher speed applications," said Chuck Liggett, 
   Tymnet Marketing Specialist.  

      Tymnet is also a leading value-added reseller of 2400 bps modems to 
   complement its 2400 bps service.  Its 931 and 932 models are new-generation
   low-cost V.22bis-compatible modems operating over ordinary telephone lines
   at 2400 bps full duplex in synchronous and asynchronous modes.  Tymnet is 
   the first value-added network supplier to offer 2400 bps modems.

      Tymnet, McDonnell Douglas Network Systems Company, in addition to 
   providing local access from more than 540 locations in the U.S., serves 
   some 65 countries.  The company has also installed more private networks 
   than any other supplier, including half of all domestic networks designed 
   last year.

          X.25/X.75 REFERENCE MANUAL STATEMENTS THAT COULD MISLEAD

      Statements in the X.25/x.75 Reference Manual, dated March 31, 1984, that
    have been misunderstood include those concerning:

            1)  CALLING ADDRESS STATEMENT - OLDADR option
            2)  HOST COST MESSAGES TO THE SUPERVISOR
            3)  TCNL(NONE) PROBLEM WITH MORE THAN ONE LINK

 
   
      1) CALLING ADDRESS STATEMENT - OLDADR OPTION

      Page 77 of the X.25/X.75 Reference Manual in describing the options for
   the CALLING ADDRESS Statement (CLGADR) says:

      "OLDADR specifies that the calling address be formed by appending
      a 5 digit binary-coded-octal representation of the originating node
      number and a 5 digit binary-coded-decimal representation of the
      originating port number to the 4 digit DNIC."

      The X.25 code expects to get the originating port number from the needle
   as described in the ISIS manual (ISIS-II, p10) which defines the 15th and 
   16th bytes of the Needle as the Originating Port Number.  THE NEEDLE DOES 
   NOT CONTAIN THE ORIGINATING PORT NUMBER, THEREFORE THE XCOM CODE CANNOT PUT
   IT IN THE DNIC.

      Attempts have been made to ascertain the originating port number so that
   it could be included in data sent to the called address, but so far no way
   has been found to do it.

      THE OLDADR OPTION WILL PUT THE ORIGINATING NODE NUMBER IN THE DNIC, BUT
   NOT THE ORIGINATING PORT NUMBER.



      2)  HOST COST STATEMENTS TO THE SUPERVISOR

      Page 33 of the X.25/X.75 Reference Manual states:

      "The time interval between the (HOST COST) reports to the
      Supervisor will be at least 15 seconds."

      The Host Cost value is checked every 15 seconds, but it is reported to
   the Supervisor only when it has changed.  The Host Cost statement 
   parameters determine how many users logging on or off are needed to make a
   change.

      WARNING:  If the HOSTCOST Statement doesn't succeed in leveling the load
   to targetted hosts, be sure the node housing the destination host has Pass-
   throughs enabled, or the line cost to that host will be prohibitive and 
   calls will not be routed to it.  This is to be changed by a new release of
   Supervisor code.



      3)  TCNL(NONE) PROBLEM WITH MORE THAN ONE LINK

      The 2-Way Channel Statement (page 52) of the X.25/X.75 Reference Manual
   says:

      "The statement TCNL(NONE) may be used to specify that there
      will be no two-way channels."

      This works when there is just one link specified in the TYMFILE.  There
   was a problem when 256 DPORTs were distributed over 2 links with 128 on 
   each link.  All channels were to be incoming with no two-way channels.  The
   TCNL(NONE) statement caused a fatal sysgen error because the code inserted 
   values for low and high two-way channels on link 0.  Currently, the only 
   way to avoid this error is to allow at least 1 two-way channel on Link 0.

                        -----------------------------


Written by : M. R. Becker, V.P. of Human Resources
      Date : September 20, 1985




      Employees are encouraged to increase their capabilities and value to
   ISG by participating in approved educational programs, whereby the costs of
   the educational program are refunded to the employee to the extent speci-
   fied in this policy.

   This program is applicable to all full time regular employees of ISG 
   employing companies as designated by the ISG Management Committee.

   Career development programs eligible for reimbursement fall into two (2) 
   categories as follows:

   1.  Adult Education Program

       The Adult Education Program provides assistance to employees partici-
       pating in non-credit courses designed to develop potential capabili-
       ties.  The Adult Education Program consists of the following:

       - High school equivalency preparation
       - High school diploma
       - Remedial education
       - Job related vocational courses

   2.  College Study Program

       A program which falls into one of the following categories:

             Job related: An educational program which when taken, 
             is expected to improve the employee's performance in 
             his/her current position and/or increase the 
             employee's capabilities for promotion into a higher 
             position within ISG organizations.

             Certificate/Degree related:  An undergraduate or post 
             graduate curriculum at an accredited college or 
             university which is related to the employee's 
             profession or other business related professions which 
             the employee intends to pursue within ISG 
             organizations.



   Eligibility

       To be eligible for reimbursement of educational costs, an employee must
       be a full-time regular employee at the time of enrollment and at the 
       time the course is successfully completed.  In addition, the employee 
       must be in an active pay status at the time of course completion and 
       must not be on a leave of absence.  Those who retire, are laid-off, or
       enter active United States military service after enrollment, but prior
       to course completion, may be eligible for reimbursement, provided all 
       other requirements have been met.

       The course or program must be conducted by an approved and/or 
       accredited educational institution.

       Courses, programs and subjects undertaken must receive approval by 
       employee's supervisor and acknowledgments by their local Human 
       Resources organization prior to the start of the course.

       An employee who is eligible for tuition assistance through veterans' 
       benefits, federal aid, scholarship or other such programs after 
       reporting such eligibility, may be eligible or that portion not covered
       as specified in this policy.

   Enrollment

       Employees will be limited to enrollment in not more than two (2) 
       courses plus one (1) lab per semester.

       ISG reserves the right to exclude from inclusion in this plan any 
       educational institution.

   Reimbursement

       Upon satisfactory completion of each college study course (a minimum 
       grade of "C" or equivalent, provided "C" meets the school requirements
       for degree objective), 80% of tuition, enrollment fees, textbooks, 
       required instructional material, laboratory, and other recurring fees 
       will be reimbursed.  Courses taken under the Pass/Fail option are not
       reimbursable.  Grades are based upon an A, B, C, D, and F scale.  In 
       Adult education programs which are graded "A" thru "F", the "C" grade 
       rule applies for eligibility for reimbursement.  Other evidences of 
       satisfactory completion, such as diplomas, certificates or letters from
       the institution are acceptable when no grades are given.

       Maximum employee reimbursement per calendar year is $3,000 and presen-
       tation of evidence of course/program completion, grades and receipts 
       are required.

   Reimbursement  (Continued)

       The Educational Reimbursement Plan is not a contract.  It may be 
       terminated or modified at any time without prior notice.

       Currently, educational refunds to ISG personnel are not subject to 
       income tax withholding or reporting to the Internal Revenue Service.

   Educational Leave of Absence

       Leaves of absence for educational purposes are prepared and approved 
       the same as all other leaves of absence, with the exception that 
       approval of the cognizant Department Head and Human Resources is also 
       required.

       Reimbursement of expenses while on a leave of absence is not authorized
       except for those pursuing a Doctorate Degree, in which case reimburse-
       ment is limited to a maximum of twelve (12) months during required 
       residency.

   Reduced Work Week For Educational Purposes

       The reduced work week is authorized for graduate degree programs only 
       and requires the approval of the cognizant Department Head and Human 
       Resources.  The reduced work week permits salaried employees to work 
       not less than twenty (20) hours nor more than forty (40) hours per 
       week.  This plan stipulates that salaried employees be paid based on 
       actual hours worked.  Those benefits available immediately prior to the
       beginning of the reduced work week will be retained.  The work schedule
       is established not normally to exceed eight (8) hours per day.

   Approval of Educational Program

       Employees applying for educational reimbursement will complete an "ISG
       Educational Reimbursement Application" at least two (2) weeks prior to
       the first class meeting.  The application must be approved by the 
       employee's supervisor and acknowledged by their local Human Resources 
       organization to assure consistency related to guidelines.

       Human Resources will review the application and notify the supervisor 
       of approval of disapproval.  The supervisor will then notify the 
       employee.  If the application is not approved, the employee will be 
       informed of the reason.

   Obtaining Reimbursement

       Upon completion of the course(s) and no later than ten (10) weeks from
       the last scheduled meeting of the course, the employee must submit to 
       Human Resources:

             An official grade report or other evidence establishing
             satisfactory completion of the course(s) as specified  
             under the "Reimbursement" section.

             Official receipts showing actual costs paid for tuition,
             required textbooks, and other eligible course fees paid
             to the educational institution.

       Human Resources will complete the authorization section showing 
       approved costs reimbursable on the "ISG Educational Reimbursement 
       Application".  The authorization is then forwarded to Accounts 
       Payable for payment to the employee.

       When a course is not completed but it can be clearly shown that non-
       completion was due to Company action, other than discharge for cause, 
       the refund may be granted provided that all other conditions are met.

                      TESTING OF A TYMNET X.121 ADDRESS
                      ---------------------------------

      Ever have a Tymnet X.121 address and want to test it out?  That's one
   of those funny numbers like 3106001234 or 31069001234.  Don't have access
   to an X.75 gateway?  You due now.  

      To test a host that should be in group 19, thats the group on the 
      Supervisor that a host must be in to be X.121 addressable in the
      3106001234 format:

      1)  Use either NET3 or ISISTECH to log into MUX host 140.
   
      2)  enter the command m<cr> to make a circuit.

      3)  again use NET3 or ISISTECH and build a circuit to host 4761.

      4)  at the ; prompt enter the address to test i.e. 3106001234 or
          310600123401 etc.

      5)  if you receive a "call cleared (c 11,d129): access barred"
          than the host in questions is NOT in group 19.

   If you wish to run a quick test thru a gateway just continue after the
   connect.  To test an address that begins with a 9 i.e. 31069001234 perform
   the above process but if the address has not been set up correctly you will
   receive "call cleared (c 5,d 67): network congestion". 

   If you find you are not valid in group 19 but must run a test to confirm to
   the customer that his application will indeed work thru an X.75 gateway 
   then substitute host 4757 in line 3 above.  You have access to hosts that 
   may not be valid in group 19 at that time.

   For security reasons you must be logged into MUX 140 for this test to work.
   If it is found that this privilege is abused than the NET3 and ISISTECH 
   usernames will be removed from host 140.  If there are still questions you
   can contact a CC from our gateway operations group via 703/356-6995 8am to
   7pm EDT.

      When escalating problems concerning the Solo CONSAT (version 5.11),
   please provide a concise description of the problem, any symptoms noticed
   and a detailed description of what the user/customer did to see such a 
   problem.  If the problem is with a public access node, please provide the
   node number as well as the dial-up number so that we may try to re-create 
   the problem.  Please also include the terminal type, speed, and TID used.

   1.  If the user dials in and sees a string of UUUUUs, this is an indication
       that the node has crashed and will restart.  If the node did not crash
       at that time, please provide NTD with the above details and we will 
       look into each reported case.

   2.  Crypto log messages "Data on unassigned channel" and "Zap on unassigned
       channel" are informational messages.  They ARE NOT error diagnostic
       messages and DO NOT indicate a problem.  Please do not report these
       occurrences.

   3.  Please do not report hardware crashes or powerfail restarts.

   Thank you all for helping NTD resolve problems with the Solo CONSAT -
   we appreciate your efforts.

                ASYNC-TO-3270 SUPPORT OF THE 3270 STATUS LINE
                ---------------------------------------------
                ---------------------------------------------
                      
 
Written by : Mary Chalmers
      Date : October 1895




      Good News!!!  A new, important feature of Tymnet's Async-to-3270 Soft-
   ware is ready for beta testing.  It's an emulation of the IBM 3270 25th  
   Status Line.  It will make the product alot more user friendly which means
   it will be easier for you to sell and win in competitive situations.
 
   During 4Q85 this feature will be beta tested with the Bisync Host Intf.  
   And is scheduled for limited release 1Q86 for use with a Bisync Host 
   Interface.  SNA limited release sites may be considered in special cases.
   In all cases, Product Marketing must be contacted for beta testing 
   coordination.  The product code is CMTI version 3.00.
 
   Why do your customers want this feature?
   1.  3270 users are used to looking at "session status"
   2.  lets the end user know what editing feature they are using,
       for example, insert mode, numeric field, protected field
   3.  gives end user easy access to their printer name
   4.  tells end user when the keyboard is locked
   5.  and more! so read on 'cause it may help you make that sale
 
   And best of all, the display of the Status Line is very flexiable.
   1.  the end user can toggle it on and off from the keyboard
   2.  it can be written on any line 1 to 24, and 25 if the terminal
       can support it, or written to the upper right hand corner of
       the screen:
          a.  your customer can a chose the default for the Tymfile
        AND
          b.  the end user may toggle the place to write it from the
              keyboard
   3.  The text display can be changed in the Tymfile.  For
       example, if your customer does not like "LOCK" to indicate
       the keyboard lock condition but wants "PARE", that's
       Spanish for "Stop", Tymnet can set up their Tymfile that
       way or any other 4 characters they want.
 
   The following is a brief explanation of what a real 3270 25th Status Line 
   looks like to the end user.  Please refresh your memory if you haven't seen
   a real 3270 for a while.  It will help you explain Tymnet's Status Line and
   overcome customer objections due to lack of understanding the features of 
   your product.
 
   IBM 3270 25TH STATUS LINE--This is the "Operator Information Area" and is 
   used on real 3270 devices to let the end user know:
           1.  Communications Check-- tells if the host and
                terminal are connected or not.
                a.  if connected --stickman means "no host session"
                                  --block means "in host session"
 
                b.  if not connected--lightning blot is displayed and
                one of over 50 error codes are displayed
 
            2.  Do Not Enter (Input Inhibited)--this is the keyboard
                locked condition and is symbolized by a clock.
 
            3.  Shift and Modes--i.e. Insert is up arrow; if
                the cursor is in a numeric field NUM is displayed
 
            4.  Printer Status--tells if printer is busy or
                unavailable and gives printer ID.
 
   TYMNET'S ASYNC-TO-3270 STATUS LINE SUPPORT:
 
      1.  Communications Check --Tymnet's English Language network
          messages provide easy to understand messages rather than
          IBM's cryptic ideograms; for example:
             Please Log In:
             HOST DOWN
             ERROR, TYPE USER NAME
             PLEASE TRY AGAIN
 
      2.  Do Not Enter--Tymnet Status Line displays "LOCK".
           Only the Reset Key is allowed.
 
      3.  Insert Mode--Tymnet Status Line displays "ISRT".
 
      4.  Numeric Lock (NUM)--Tymnet Status Line displays "NULK".
           The cursor is in a numeric unprotected field and only the
           0 thru 9, decimal (.) or minus sign (-) are allowed.
 
      5.  Printer Status--Tymnet Status Line has two entries for
           printers:
              a.  Printer ID or Printer LU Name can be displayed.
                  That long number you need in the demo.  This is a
                  Tymfile option.
              b.  Tymnet Status Line displays "WAIT" while a print
                  job is being sent to an aux port attached printer.
    
      6.  Unavailable function (-f)--Tymnet Status Line displays
           "-f" just like a real 3270.  User needs to hit Reset Key
           to unlock their keyboard.
    
      7.  Protected Field--Tymnet Status Line displays "PROT".  End
           user should move cursor to an input allowed field.
 
      8.  Session Status/Level of Connection--Tymnet Status Line
           displays product ID "BSC, SNA, X.25, CMT, UNK (if
           unknown)
            a.  BSC Host Interface "APPL" means your are talking to
                the IBM Bisync Host.
            b.  SNA Host Interface support for this feature is not
                expected until 4Q86 beta test and is the Sys/Req
                key.
 
      9.  CRT LU Name--This is the IBM LU name for the CRT and can
          be very helpful to IBM host operators when helping an end
          user solve a problem.  It is a Tymfile option.

      Date : Octover 14, 1985




      There has been a major personnel change in the Applications Support
   Unit which will affect the product support structure within this group.

   First, please join me in welcoming Ms. Fun-Lin Chen and Mr. Jeff Liu to the
   group.  Fun-Lin brought to us four years of application software experi-
   ences in the data communication industry including her work with Northern 
   Telecom, Zilog and Mohawk.  She has a M.S. in Computer Science from State 
   U. of New York and a M.B.A. from Central State Univ. of Okalahoma.  

   Jeff was a software engineer with Pacific Systems Group prior to joining
   Tymnet.  He also has a M.S. in Computer Science from U. of Santa Clara,
   and a M.S. in Engineering Administration from Bradley Univ. of Illinois.

   Both Fun-Lin and Jeff have attended a series of the Tymnet training classes
   and are sharpening themselves ready to help you all solve any problems in
   the areas of Tymnet applications that may come to their attentions.

   You gain some, you loose some!  We will be missing Shiao-Ming Tsui for a 
   little while - she is on maternity leave from Oct. 14 through Jan. 5, '86.
   During her absence, Fun-Lin and Jeff as well as other members of the group
   will split up the support functions Shiao-Ming used to carry.

   Also, Amy kwok has been officially tranferred to Carl Langdon's unit (still
   within the Technical Services section) to support ISIS, Sup code and Node 
   code.  We are very sorry that she is no longer part of our group.  She's
   been absolutely pleasant to work with and one of the most invaluable members.
   We believe she'll enjoy her new role and continue to be a dedicated contri-
   butor to the Technical Services.  For the time being, Amy will still be the
   major support for Netval/Val and Loadii.

            PUBLIC NETWORK CODE MANAGEMENT - NEW BACKUP PROCEDURE     
            -----------------------------------------------------
            -----------------------------------------------------


Written by : Beryl Agua
      Date : October 15, 1985




      NOVEMBER 11, 1985 IS THE TENTATIVE TARGET DATE TO BRING UP THE RECENTLY 
   ACQUIRED KL PROCESSOR FOR PUBLIC NETWORK CODE MANAGEMENT.  THE FOUR (4)
   SYSTEMS WILL BE UTILIZED AS FOLLOWS:

                            (TYMNET)                  (TYM4000)
 
   PRIMARY SYSTEM/           25 - DALLAS KL            54 - DALLAS KL
   LOADING SYSTEM        

   BACKUP SYSTEM             70 - CUPERTINO KI          33 - CUPERTINO KL


   SINCE EVERYONE WILL HAVE ACCESS TO EACH SYSTEM, THE CURRENT BACKUP PRO-
   CEDURES WILL BE GREATLY AFFECTED.  I AM PROPOSING THE FOLLOWING SCENARIO:

   BACKUP PROCEDURES
   ------ ----------

   1)  EACH REGIONAL TECH MANAGER WOULD NEED TO SET UP A 'REGIONAL DIRECTORY'
       TO HOUSE THE MOST RECENT SLOT CODE ON A GIVEN NODE IN EITHER SYSTEM 25
       OR 54, DEPENDING ON THE NODE NUMBER.  THIS 'REGIONAL DIRECTORY' WILL
       SIMPLY BE A 'CENTRAL LOCATION' FOR THE FIELD TO PLACE THEIR SLOT CODE 
       FROM THEIR OWN PERSONAL DIRECTORIES. 

   2)  CODE GENERATION WOULD THEN RENAME THE CODE FROM THE 'REGIONAL DIRECT-
       ORY' INTO THE TYMNET OR TYM4000 DIRECTORY UPON RECEIPT OF A BACKUP
       REQUEST.  I WILL BE CREATING A SKELETON FOR BACKUP REQUESTS, TO BE
       USED BY ALL REGIONS.  THIS SKELETON WILL INCLUDE ALL THE INFORMATION
       NEEDED TO COMPLETE A BACKUP REQUEST IN A TIMELY MANNER.

   3)  LAST, A SIMPLE MERLIN PROGRAM WOULD BE RUN BY THE CODE GENERATOR TO
       BIND THE SLOT CODE WITH THE NODE CODE.  THE BACKUP SUMMARY REPORT WOULD
       BE WRITTEN, AS IT IS NOW, TO NOTIFY THE COMMUNICATIONS CONSULTANT THAT
       THEIR BACKUP IS COMPLETE.

   ADVANTAGES
   ----------

   1)  CODE GENERATION WOULD NO LONGER HAVE TO TELECOPY FILES FROM SYSTEM TO 
       SYSTEM.  TELECOPY PROCEDURES ARE OFTEN FRUSTRATING AND TIME CONSUMING.
       WHEN SUCCESSFUL, TELECOPY IS SLOW AND TIES UP PORTS.

   2)  THE FIELD WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE AVAILIBILITY OF THE SLOT CODE.

   3)  THE TIME SPENT TO PERFORM BACKUP REQUESTS WOULD BE GREATLY REDUCED.  
       THIS WOULD FREE UP ADDITIONAL MAN-HOURS.

   4)  STORAGE ON ALL SYSTEMS WOULD BE REDUCED SINCE WE WOULD WRITE OVER THE
       OLD SLOT CODE RATHER THAN RETAIN A BK SLOT FILE.

   5)  ON-CALL COMMUNICATIONS CONSULTANTS WOULD KNOW EXACTLY WHERE TO LOOK FOR
       THE GOOD SLOT CODE.  IT WOULD BE IN THE TYMNET DIRECTORY PROVIDED A 
       BACKUP REQUEST HAS BEEN SUBMITTED AND COMPLETED.


   THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGE WOULD BE THE EFFECT ON THE FIELD.  THEY WOULD
   NEED TO ORGANIZE THEMSELVES TO ESTABLISH A 'REGIONAL DIRECTORY'.  KEN 
   ENRIGHT (EASTERN REGION) HAS SUBMITTED A PROPOSAL TO GARY WALKER THAT COULD
   BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE FIELD.  I WOULD LIKE THE FIELD TO CREATE THREE (3) 
   DIRECTORIES, i.e., WESTECH, CENTECH, EASTECH.  THIS WOULD SIMPLIFY MATTERS
   FOR CODE GENERATION.  THE FIELD CAN TAKE WHATEVER STEPS THEY WANT TO
   ESTABLISH THEIR 'REGIONAL DIRECTORY'.  MY MAIN INTEREST IS THAT THEY ARE 
   IN EFFECT WHEN WE MOVE TO FOUR (4) SYSTEMS.

   I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SUGGEST ANOTHER AVENUE TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TIME 
   UTILIZED FOR BACKUP REQUESTS.  THAT IS, FOR THE COMMUNICATIONS CONSULTANT
   TO HAVE THEIR SLOT CODE AVAILABLE AT THE TIME OF AN ACTUAL NEW INSTALL.
   WITH THIS PROCEDURE IN PLACE, THE CODE GENERATORS WOULD THEN ONLY NEED 
   TO BIND THE CODE TOGETHER ONLY ONCE.  THIS WOULD ALSO ENSURE THAT THE 
   SLOT CODE WOULD BE READY BY THE SCHEDULE DATE.  I WOULD APPRECIATE SOME
   FEEDBACK IN REGARD TO THIS MATTER.

   ONE LAST COMMENT THAT I BELIEVE IS NECESSARY AT THIS POINT.  I AM VERY 
   CONCERNED WHETHER OR NOT WE WILL BE EXPERIENCING THE SAME 'HOST OUT OF C
   PORTS' SITUATION, ESPECIALLY WITH THE FIELD VALIDATED ON ALL FOUR (4)
   SYSTEMS.  EILLEN RIORDAN HAS ASSURED ME THAT SHE WILL BE 'HARD-NOSED'
   IF THIS RE-OCCURS.  ALSO, THE FIELD HABITUALLY BUILDS AUX CIRCUITS FROM
   SYSTEM TO SYSTEM, TYING UP PORTS.  AS A RESULT, WE GET A SLOWER RESPONSE 
   TIME.  THESE ARE OUR TWO BIGGEST DRAWBACKS IN CODE GENERATION.  LET'S HOPE
   THESE INSTANCES DO NOT COME BACK TO 'HAUNT' US.

   AGAIN, YOUR COMMENTS ARE WELCOME.  YOUR HELP IS NEEDED TO BETTER THE 
   PROCESS.

      I am pleased to announce the formation of a Policies and Procedures 
   department within the Finance group of McDonnell Douglas Business and 
   Network Systems Company, reporting to Lynne Hanson.
 
      The new organization will coordinate and assist all areas in the 
   formation and standardization of MDBANS procedures, manuals and organi-
   zational charts.  It will also perform the coordination and implementation
   of the ISG Management Handbook.
 
      David Jacot will be the focal point of this effort.  He has been with 
   the company for two years in TTMS and Tymnet.  Working with Dave will be 
   a newcomer to MDBANS, Sandra Cunningham.  Sandra comes to us from Pitney 
   Bowes where she worked in sales as a Customer Representative selling  
   Pitney Bowes copiers.
 
      David and Sandra are located in Finance at 20705 Valley Green Drive, or
   if you would like to talk with them, call David at (408) 446-7237 
   (FIN.D/JACOT) and Sandra at (408) 446-6711 (FIN.S/CUNNINGHAM).
 
      Please join me in welcoming them to MDBANS Finance group.

                    ASYNC-TO-3270 SNA/SDLC AND SYSTEM 38s

      We are looking for a customer who is willing to work with us to certify
   the IBM System 38 for use with our Async-to-3270 SNA/SDLC service.

   Although we have been hearing about this for some time, we now have 
   confirmation -- the System 38 can support 3270 terminal devices AS A HOST.

   We have found two companies out there who are doing this now with real 
   3270s and leased lines.  The System 38's Control Program Facility (CPF) 
   operating system has a 3270-to-5250 converter in it that allows 3270s to 
   talk to 5250 applications on the 38.

   If you have a customer who wants to work with us to certify this capability
   with our Async-to-3270 service, please send me an Ontyme (NSMS.G/Smith) 
   or call (x5214).



   To give you a little background info, the following is IBM's description
   of this capability taken from their manual:

   S/38 AS A HOST FOR REMOTE 3270 INFORMATION DISPLAY SYSTEM DEVICES:  The 
   3270 Remote Attach support allows an S/38 to appear as a host system for 
   remote 3270 controllers and devices.  The attached device will appear to 
   the S/38 CPF and application programs as a remote 5250.  When the 3270 is 
   signed on to the S/38, the operator will be able to access all S/38 
   features and functions allowable to a similarly configured and authorized 
   5250 Display Station.  Many S/38 user programs will be able to run without
   changes.  Terminal differences exist which cause certain functions to 
   appear differently.

   Support is provided for SNA/SDLC networks only.  The 3270 Remote Attach 
   will support up to 32 devices per controller.  Switched and nonswitched 
   line attachment is provided (multipoint or point-to-point).




   NOTE:  This capability is only supported on the System 38  - NOT the System
   34, 36 or 32.

   consist of the states of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee,
   Mississippi and all states east of these states.  Western Field Operations
   will consist of the remaining western states.
                
   Jim MacDonald will be promoted to the position of Director - Eastern Field

   The re-organization will provide a foundation for future strategic growth 
   by improving sales focus through the segregation of Public and Private 
   Network sales activities.  In addition, the consolidation of technical 
   support organizations will improve technical uniformity, productivity and 
   customer support.
                
   A series of meetings will be held at key Tymnet field offices during the 
   week of October 28th.  These meeting will address Tymnet's strategic 
   direction during the next few years and provide further organizational 
   structure details.  A schedule of meeting locations, dates, etc will be 
   published next week.
                



   Congratulations to the above management team on their new assignments!  
   Collectively and individually the team has a wealth of data communications
   experience and demonstrated records of achievement.  I look forward to 
   working with this talented group of individuals on the exciting challenges
   and opportunities of the future.

      NSR 415 makes reference to a problem with the Consat under conditions
   of extreme overload "extreme enough to elicit heavy backtroud and fore-
   ground overload reports".

   I have heard, under other circumstances, that customers have been told
   that foreground overload reports are not serious.  I would like it made
   clear that foreground overloads are very serious and we can make no
   certification that any product will perform properly under conditions of
   foreground overload.  We cannot even confirm that the failure will be
   graceful.

      This memo serves to provide explanation of log message "INOPERABLE"
   being issued on SDLC monitor :

   "INOPERABLE" message will be processed if the following circumstances 
   occur:

   At TIF --

   1)  When retry counter is decremented to 0 in NRM
       (receiving time-out -- idle conditions)           (HPINOP)

   2)  When DM frame is received from external system in NRM   (HPRDM)

   3)  When un-expected frames are received from external system
       in NRM. These frames include SNRM, UI, and REJ.        (HPRNEF)

   4)  Timout happens when I-frame is being re-transmitted
       to external system.                                    (HPARXM)

   5)  Timout happens when any frames are being transmitted
       to external system in both NRM and NDM.

   Action taken by TIF -- TIF will send DM frame to HIF and
   go to NDM.
    

   At HIF --

   1)  Timout happens when I-frame is being re-transmitted to
       external system in NRM.                                  (HSARXM,HSARX!)
   
   2)  Timout happens when any frames are being transmitted
       to external system in both NRM and NDM.

   Action taken by HIF -- HIF will send DISC frame to TIF
   and go to NDM.

  RESTRICTED LIMITED RELEASE STATUS FOR PUBLIC NET 3270 BISYNC HOST INTERFACE
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------


Written by: Mary Chalmers/Mike Lucido
      Date: October 24, 1985




      Version 7.05 PBH, the 3270 Bisync Host Interface, is now available in 
   Limited Release and all persons requesting usage of this version of code 
   must be approved by Product Marketing and Technical Services.
 
   All older versions of the code which have been in full release are still 
   in full release.  The most current full release is Version 7.03.  HOWEVER,
   if plan to use either the Disconnect or Greeting Message we STRONGLY urge 
   you to fill out the questions below anyway and submit it to ** BSC early in
   your installation process.
 
   Why are we asking you to do this?
 
   The field is having serious problems installing the 3270 Bisync Host 
   Interface using the Disconnect Message and/or the Greeting Message.  We 
   realize that documentation for these features is very poor at the present 
   time and as a first step in changing that we are asking you to contact
   HQ for ASSISTANCE before you install any new BSC HIF's if you plan to use 
   either the disconnect message or the greeting message. We have some new 
   information that may save you alot of time if we can get involved early in
   the process.
 
   What will happen when you send in your answers to ** BSC?
 
   1.  If you want to use 7.05 and don't want a disconnect or greeting message
   or have any other "special" requirements your request should be approved.
 
   2.  If you need to use a disconnect or greeting message in 7.05 or even 
   full release versions we want to HELP you from the START.  HQ Tech Svcs
   will be back in touch with you within 7 days with information to help you
   and the customer decide what is the best way to handle either a disconnect
   or a greeting message for their IBM installation.  It is not our intent to
   turn down any requests based solely on the information you are supplying us
   by answering the questions below, but rather, to get basic information we 
   need to start assisting you with this difficult probelm.
 
   Why would your customer want to upgrade to 7.05?
 
   It has the 24PF  key support for the block mode 3101. That's why.  Now your
   customers who use the new version of Softerm from Softronics for the IBM PC
   can have all 24 PF keys.  Users with other packages or real IBM 3101's will
   used the 8 PF keys for PF1 thru 8 and esc i for PF 9, esc j for PF 10 and 
   so on down the alphabet (lower case) for the rest of the PF keys up to 24.
   And, yes, we realize using the aplhabet is not the most "user friendly" way
   to do PF keys but the IBM 3101 is not the most "user friendly" terminal 
   ever created, so don't call us call IBM.
 
 
 
   If you have a customer who wants the 24PF keys you may request they be 
   considered as a PBH version 7.05 Limited Release site.
 
   All requests ASSISTANCE for full release code or for Limited Release code 
   should be submitted via an Ontyme sent to the ** BSC distribution list, 
   with answers to the following questions:
 
   1)  IBM Host type (370,43xx, etc):
   2)  Communications program and release level (CICS, TSO, IMS, etc):
   3)  Access Method and release level(BTAM, VTAM, ACF/VTAM, etc):
   4)  Operating System and release level (VM/SP, MVS/SP, DOS/VSE, etc):
   5)  Is the use of a "greeting message" currently SUCCESSFULY implemented in
       the customer's interface? (Y/N): (If yes, go to question 10)
   6)  Have you discussed the "greeting message" feature with your customer?
       (Y/N):
   7)  Describe your discussion:
   8)  Does your customer have need of this "greeting message" feature? (Y/N):
       (if the answer to this question is "no", please go to question # 10)
   9)  Describe, in detail, EXACTLY what the customer needs in the way of a

THE FRENCH PTT IS MAKING A SIGNIFICANT STEP TOWARDS 'ISDN' IMPLEMENTATION
WITH AN IMPACT ON ALL OF US :

        * FRENCH TELEPONE NUMBERS ARE NOW 8 DIGITS LONG INSTEAD OF 7.
          THIS SHOULD BE PROGRESSIVELY COPIED BY MANY ADMINISTRATIONS.

THIS MODIFICATION OF THE TELEPHONE NUMBERING SYSTEM IS
IMPORTANT FOR US FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS :

        1. MODIFICATION OF THE INFORMATION PUBLISHED ON ALL OF OUR BROCHURES.

           * PARIS TELEPHONE NUMBERS WILL HAVE A LEADING '4' ADDED.

           * OUR TELEPHONE NUMBER IS NOW : 011-331 4602 61 32
                                                   =


        2. TRANSPAC NEW ACCESS NUMBER SHOULD BE COMMUNICATED TO MANY USERS
           AND P.C. PROGRAM DEVELOPPERS.
           THE FOLLOWING NUMBERS ARE THE SAME WHEN CALLING FROM THE FRENCH
           PROVINCES AS WELL AS CALLING FROM PARIS/GREATER PARIS.

           300 bps. --> THE NEW NUMBER IS : 3601 9100.
          1200 bps. --> THE NEW NUMBER IS : 3600 9122.

   new RAM 10.07 patch file.

   The latest addition to the RAM 10.07 patch file corrects a problem with
   RAM's rejection of a valid login-string. This problem was discovered during
   the testing of recent RAM code and also reported by a customer running RAM
   10.07 on a private network.  The customer could not log back into RAM after
   the circuit had been zapped by the network.

   This patch file also includes:

   o  A change in the format of the HDR2 label.  Zeroes are now inserted in 
      position 51 and 52 to conform to ANSI Standards.

   o  A correction to the code that processes those session records associated
      with a UUN of zero.  These records are ignored in a private network.  
      Prior to the correction, the test for these type records caused RAM to 
      also ignore records during a drain that had not yet received a UUN 
      value.

      AS MOST OF YOU HAVE ANTICIPATED TYMNET I WILL NOT BE TOTALLY REMOVED BY
   NOV. 1.  THE NEW TARGET DATE IS NOV. 15.  THIS DATE IS DEPENDENT ON THE 
   CODE RELEASES FOR E-BUSS AND GATEWAY, BUT CAN BE ACHIEVED IF WE CONTINUE 
   WITH OUR CURRENT LEVEL OF EFFORT.  I WISH TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THEIR 
   EFFORTS TO DATE AND ASSURE EVERYONE THAT THE PROGRESS WE'VE BEEN MAKING 
   NEEDS TO CONTINUE.  ALL CONVERSIONS SCHEDULED TO BE COMPLETED BY THE FIRST,
   THAT ARE NOT AWAITING SOFTWARE RELEASE SHOULD COMPLETE ON SCHEDULE.

   EVEN THOUGH ALL TYMNET I WILL NOT BE GONE ON NOV. 1, IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT 
   WE REDUCE THE NUMBER AS FAR AS POSSIBLE PRIOR TO THE HOLIDAY SEASON.  EACH
   TYMNET I NODE CONSUMES THE EQUIVALENT OF 15 TYMNET II NODES IN BOTH MEMORY
   AND CPU TIME IN THE SUPERVISOR.  WITH THE INCREASED LOGIN RATE FROM POS 
   DURING THE HOLIDAYS, THE REDUCTION IN TYMNET I WILL ENSURE PROPER RESPONSE
   FOR OUR CURRENT CUSTOMER BASE.

   THE T-II GATEWAY CODE IS DELAYED AGAIN AND RELEASE IS EXPECTED EARLY NEXT 
   WEEK.  ONCE RELEASED, I SUGGEST THAT ALL GROUPS CONCERNED LOAD AT LEAST 
   ONE GATEWAY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO GAIN SOME EXPERIENCE WITH IT.  ONCE WE 
   ARE COMFORTABLE WITH ITS PERFORMANCE, WE WILL PURSUE A VERY AGGRESSIVE 
   CONVERSION SCHEDULE.

   THE E-BUSS PROJECT IS DELAYED PENDING SUCCESSFUL OPERATION ON SYSTEMS 12, 
   39, AND 57.  ONCE WE ARE SATISFIED WITH THOSE SYSTEMS, WE WILL SCHEDULE THE
   REMAINDER TO CONVERT.

   940 NET IS CURRENTLY BEING TESTED.  COMPLETION IS EXPECTED BY 11/8.

   HSA IS WORKING WITH NO KNOWN PROBLEMS AT THIS TIME.

   PVC SUPPORT IN XCOM VERSION 3.01

      One of the new features of Version 3.01 of XCOM is the ability to 
   support Permanent Virtual Channels.  This PVC feature conforms to the Host-
   Network communication protocol as specified by CCITT 1980, with the 
   exception that XCOM 301 supports a maximum  255 PVC channels/link.

   Documentation to support PVC's may be found online in (NETMID:39)PVC.DOC.

   This document describes the two Tymfile statements PCNL and PVCHANNEL.  The
   two must be used together.  PCNL specifies the number of channels to be 
   reserved as PVC channels for a link and PVCHANNEL provides network and 
   packet level information regarding the PVC.  Also described are configur-
   ation considerations, error handling, accounting messages, usernames and 
   Data Packets and resets.

   (MIDBAK:39)XCOM03.D01 includes PVC.DOC in an appendix.  It also contains

   PROBLEMS WITH DEC VAX RUNNING VERSION 3.0 VMS AND PSI SOFTWARE

      (Thanks to John Bell for this information)

      Customer was trying to build a call out of his  DEC Vax running Version
   3.0 VMS and PSI software to a Tymcom through the network.  He was only 
   receiving garbaged output from the Tymcom host when he got connected.

   It turns out that there is a parameter in the DEC PSI software called 
   VMS/NOVMS.  When set to VMS, the PSI thinks it will be talking to another 
   VAX running similar VMS software, which in this case was not true.  Setting
   to NOVMS threw out the garbage.

   THE ELUSIVE 'OA' CRASH CODE

      Have you ever asked:  "What is crash code 'OA'?"  Have you ever seen 
   crash code 'OA' and got tired trying to find its meaning?  That could be 
   because 'OA' is not included in the list of crash codes in the manuals.

   GOOD NEWS --
      'OA' is identified in the XCOM source code listing in the
      module ISIS STARTUP AND CRASH LIBRARY;  CRASH.LIB

   BAD NEWS --
      'OA' is identified as the default crash code or generally as
      "unknown crash".

   GOOD NEWS --  We can identify some of the times that 'OA' is used.

   Coding a crash using Crash Method 3 causes a crash code of 'OA'.  This is 
   coded as   JAL R10,CRASH   followed by an instruction that can be anything
   but HC 0 or HC 11.  This method of coding a crash is used in only a few 
   places in XCOM.  Three are for SVC failures.
               Connect SYNC input -- same as crash code EC
               Force SYNC output  -- same as crash code ED
               Force Mother Board output -- also used with TRAP and code E4
   There is also a fourth SVC failure that will give an 'OA' crash code. 
               I/O Attributes query in XOM
     
   BAD NEWS --  'OA' will also be used as default by the other two crash 
   coding methods if a crash code is not defined.  How often, or if, it is 
   used this way was not determined.

   SPURIOUS WARNING MESSAGE IN THE PATCH FILE

      The new patching facility for 2.02 and 3.01 checks to be sure that the
   length of the patch is correct.  This avoids either writing over a patch, 
   or leaving memory unused.  However, the algorithm currently in use does not 
   allow for wasted bytes when a Word boundary or Halfword boundary is 
   required.  The patch is entered correctly, starting and ending at the 
   proper addresses, but the counting begins at the end of the previous patch
   not at the boundary desired.  This causes 1, 2, or 3 bytes to be added to
   the actual length used by the patch.  Since that length does not correspond
   to the length in the PATCH or CONPATCH statement a WARNING message is
   issued.  This WARNING message will show up in one of the patches from 
   (SOURCE)XCOM02.P02. 
          PATCH added on 840214 at 1412 by GML

  FOCUS RELEASE 5.0.1 (Release Limitations)
 
      In an effort to make your testing of this release more effortless and
   less frustrating the attached information is provided to keep you aware of
   the current status of this release of Focus.
 
   As each of you are working with this new release of Focus, if you experi-
   ence any quirks, problems or have questions in general, please do not 
   hesitate to contact me.  I would like to keep everyone as informed as 
   possible on this release.

 
   1 New Date Formats
   ------------------
 
   1.1  The dates December 31st, 1900 and January 1st, 1901 are used as base
        dates for some of the New Date formats and if entered give blanks on
        output from the database.
 
   1.2  Conversion between the Old Date formats and the New Date formats is 
        not yet supported by the REBUILD function.
 
   1.3  The New Date format of YY does not accept the year 1111.  This year is
        accepted by all other full year formates (i.e., MDYY).
 
   1.4  The JULIAN format currently accepts 00366 incorrectly.  This value is
        retrieved from the database as 01001.
 
   1.5  Those formats containing concatenation symbols (eg.g, M|D|Y) are not 
        yet supported.
 
   1.6  New Date Formats are not supported in RECAP calculations within FML.
 
   1.7  New Date Format fields get summed when used as verb objects to the
        SUM verb in TABLE.
 
   2 MODIFY
   --------
 
   2.1  In a REPEAT the line ON NONEXT GOTO casename, where that casename does
        not exist, produces no error message and goes to ENDREPEAT as a 
        default.
 
   2.2  After a NOMATCH or NONEXT condition has occurred and a branch is taken
        to a CASE displaying D. fields from a parent segment, the parent D.
        fields will not display since FIDEL knows that a NOMATCH has been
        encountered but not on which segment.  Such fields are ususally 
        displayed by COMPUTING them equal to themselves.  Under such circum-
        stances, the ACTIVATE command cannot be used in place of COMPUTES 
        since the NOMATCH condition is still present.
  
   2.3  Using repeating group logic, the first REPEAT statement encountered
        must HOLD some data.  REPEAT may only be used to HOLD data or process
        data previously held.
 
   2.4  When using repeating group logic, HOLDCOUNT is reset after a CRTFORM
        containing subscripted fields to the maximum of, the number of records
        on the HOLD buffer and the highest subscript number of any entry field
        or T. field on the CRTFORM.  However, HOLDCOUNT may be saved in a
        temporary variable and used as the repetition factor in a subsequent
        REPEAT loop.
 
   3 COMBINE
   ---------
 
   3.1  The CHECK FILE command does not show the new PREFIX option for the
        COMBINE command.  The PREFIX is shown in ? COMBINE and ?F.
 
   3.2  The COMBINE command is supported where all files in the combine are
        LOCAL or are all on a single SINK machine.  An abend will occur if
        files from different sources are included in a COMBINE statement.

   4 TED
   -----
 
   4.1  On non fullscreen terminals, TED does not default to a line editor
        and the command TED is ignored.
 
   4.2  TED allows 73 columns to be typed on the screen but loses the last
        two after an ENTER when the screen is refreshed.  These two columns
        are also lost if a FILE or SAVE command is executed.
 
   4.3  The SP and J line commands are not supported in split screen mode
        and can give unpredictable results.
 
   4.4  On CMS, an attempt to SAVE or FILE a dataset from TED fails if the 
        file is on a disk which is a logical extension of another (i.e., B/A
        disk).
 
   4.5  PAINT will incorrectly pick up the word CRTFORM in -TYPE and comment 
        statements.
 
   4.6  CMS/TSO commands and some FOCUS commands may be issued on the command
        line in TED.  However, the Screen Painter does not support CMS/TSO or
        FOCUS commands on the command line.
 
   4.7  The command used to allow upper and lower case in TED is "CASE M"
        but in the Screen Painter is "SET CASE M" and does not carry through
        from either environment to the other.
 
   4.8  The command "SET CASE M" must be issued each time the PAINT screen
        is entered from TED if mixed case screens are desired.
 
   4.9  All TED and Screen Painter displays are in 24 line by 80 column mode.
 
   4.10 The ASSIGN display of the Screen Painter does not yet allow changes
        to the field length.  This must be performed in the PAINT screen.
 
   4.11 When browsing the TED HELP file, the command CASE M must be issued
        to locate lower case character strings.
 
   4.12 Issuing the command RUN on the TED command line will save and
        execute the FOCEXEC being edited.  At present, parameters cannot
        be passed to the procedure when executed in this manner.
 
   4.13 The Screen Painter does not check the number of fields on a screen
        and it is possible to exceed the limit imposed by FIDEL.  The limit
        of 300 fields per physically displayed screen (not logical screen
        scrolled with PF7/PF8) is not a practical limit in real applications,
        particularly on a 24 by 80 screen.
 
   5 TABLE
   -------
 
   5.1  The use of PAGE-BREAK in a report can sometimes create extra blank
        pages.  This error is most obvious in the HOT SCREEN feature.

      I'VE GOT SOME INFORMATION THAT I THOUGHT MIGHT BE USEFUL TO ALL OF YOU.
   I RAN INTO A SITUATION AT FIRN WHICH REQUIRED THE USE OF SYNCRONOUS,
   HALF-DUPLEX, DIAL-UP MODEMS.  NATURALLY, THE MODEMS REQUIRE RTS FROM THE
   ENGINE TO FUNCTION PROPERLY.  IN THE DEFLN STATEMENT THERE IS A PARAMETER 
   TO SPECIFY WHETHER RTS IS REQUIRED OR NOT, AS YOU ALL KNOW.

   WELL, I TRIED IT SET AS A ONE AND A ZERO WHICH HAD NO EFFECT AT ALL EITHER
   WAY.  I NEEDED THE ENGINE TO RAISE RTS TO THE MODEM BEFORE IT SENT DATA OR
   POLLS BUT IT WASN'T DOING THIS WHEN I SET RTS EQUAL TO 1.

   WELL, I TESTED IT IN A MICRO AND THE SAME CODE SEEMED TO BE RAISING RTS
   PROPERLY.  WELL, IT TURNS OUT THAT THE NEW PSM MACHINE'S BREAKOUT PANEL HAD
   A PROBLEM WITH ITS SIGNAL GROUND (DISCOVERED BY AN F.E. IN ORLANDO, FL).  
   AFTER MAKING THE MODIFICATION TO HARDWARE, THE INTERFACE WORKED FINE.  I'M
   TOLD THAT AN OFFICIAL FCO IS FORTHCOMING AND THAT ALL BREAKOUT PANELS 
   COMING OUT OF MANUFACTURING FROM THIS DAY FORWARD WILL INCLUDE THAT MODIFI-
   CATION.  UNTIL THEN, BE AWARE THAT ANY MACHINES THAT WERE SHIPPED BEFORE 
   LAST WEEK MAY HAVE SOME SIGNALLING TROUBLE (NOT JUST RTS).

                     -----------------------------------
                     -----------------------------------


Written by : Mary Lou Harline, Network Staff Consultant, HQ         
      Date : Sept. 1985




                       Users of X.25 CODE VERSION 3.01
             should be aware that the Extended DDT HELP command  
       lists some new Diagnostic features that should be used with care.


      The X.25 (Version 3.01) extended DDT HELP command gives the following 
   menu:

     -->help

     HELP  Prints this list             QUIT   Returns to DDT
     BH    Bufferlet dump in hex        BA     Bufferlet dump in ascii
     BHN   Non-empty dump in hex        BAN    Non-empty dump in ascii
     PB    Packet buffer trace          PT     Packet trace
     FT    Frame trace                  PFT    Packet and frame trace
     RI    Input ring trace             RO     Output ring trace
     SIO   SIO interpreter              OS     Output sector trace
     SELECT Diagnostic selection        REDO   Repeat selection
     SNAP  One-shot selection
     DMY1  Spare Diagnostic             DMY2   Spare Diagnostic

     00xxx = CRAT, address of the Crash Table.


     Choosing the SELECT command gives the following message:

     -->select

     Select routines from the following list:

     PB     Packet buffer trace         PT     Packet trace
     FT     Frame trace                 BHN    Non-empty dump in hex
     RI     Input ring trace            RO     Output ring trace
     OS     Output sector trace
     DMY1   Spare Diagnostic            DMY2   Spare Diagnostic

   The labels DMY1 and DMY2 are provided so technical people can write their 
   own diagnostic routines and include them with the label DMY1 or DMY2 in the
   patch area.  Do not choose them unless you have defined them.

   The SELECT, REDO and SNAP commands were designed to make real-time monitor-
   ing of the system easier.  The REDO and SNAP commands are intended to 
   repeat the series of diagnostic commands chosen in SELECT command.  Using 
   REDO or SNAP without a prior valid SELECT command may cause unpredictable 
   results.  Use of DMY1 or DMY2 after the SELECT command will also cause 
   unpredictable results unless they have been defined in the patch area, or
   unless they are included with other valid commands, in which case they will
   be ignored.

   Be careful that the commands that are typed to be included in the SELECT 
   command are typed correctly and are valid commands.

   SLOT CRASHES HAVE OCCURRED BECAUSE OF INCORRECT USE OF REDO, SNAP, DMY1 AND
   DMY2 COMMANDS.

   The X.25/X.75 FIELD GUIDE, revised Aug. 18, 1984 describes the use of

                 + + + + BEWARE OF THE "2[PATCH1:" + + + +

      Enabling the statement "2[PATCH1:" can cause problems in XCOM versions 
   other than Version 2.01.

   The Sample Command File for XCOM Version 2.01 includes the following 
   statements:

          ;;USE THE FOLLOWING SWITCH ONLY IF SEG 1 OVERFLOW OCCURS
          ;;2[PATCH1:

   These 2 lines are not in the sample command file for later versions and 
   SHOULD NOT BE USED IN LATER VERSIONS.

   They should be used only in Version 2.01, and then only when the Patch File
   itself causes the overflow.  The purpose of the 2[PATCH1: statement in 
   Version 2.01 is to prevent the possibility of the Patch File starting in 
   Seg 1 and overflowing into Seg 2.

       If "2[PATCH1:" is enabled in Version 3.00, the error statement
                 ERROR **** BAD CONPATCH(PA1PTR,,xx) <<<<
       will be found whenever a patch has more than 1 ENDPATCH statement.

   Protection errors have been noted and there have been crashes when this 
   code has been loaded.

   IT WOULD BE WISE TO REMOVE

         ;;USE THE FOLLOWING SWITCH ONLY IF SEG 1 OVERFLOW OCCURS
         ;;2[PATCH1:

   IF THESE STATEMENTS HAVE MIGRATED TO VERSION 2.02, 3.00 OR 3.01.

   It would also seem wise not to copy over a command file when changing from
   one version to another without first checking in Sample Command File for 
   the new version for any significant differences.

          X.25/X.75 REFERENCE MANUAL STATEMENTS THAT COULD MISLEAD
          --------------------------------------------------------
          --------------------------------------------------------

      Statements in the X.25/x.75 Reference Manual, dated March 31, 1984, that
   have been misunderstood include those concerning:

             1)  CALLING ADDRESS STATEMENT - OLDADR option
             2)  HOST COST MESSAGES TO THE SUPERVISOR
             3)  TCNL(NONE) PROBLEM WITH MORE THAN ONE LINK

 
   1) CALLING ADDRESS STATEMENT - OLDADR OPTION

   Page 77 of the X.25/X.75 Reference Manual in describing the options for the
   CALLING ADDRESS Statement (CLGADR) says:

   "OLDADR specifies that the calling address be formed by appending a 5 digit
   binary-coded-octal representation of the originating node number and a 5
   digit binary-coded-decimal representation of the originating port number to
   the 4 digit DNIC."

   The X.25 code expects to get the originating port number from the needle as
   described in the ISIS manual (ISIS-II, p10) which defines the 15th and 16th
   bytes of the Needle as the Originating Port Number.  THE NEEDLE DOES NOT 
   CONTAIN THE ORIGINATING PORT NUMBER, THEREFORE THE XCOM CODE CANNOT PUT IT
   IN THE DNIC.

   Attempts have been made to ascertain the originating port number so that it
   could be included in data sent to the called address, but so far no way has
   been found to do it.

   THE OLDADR OPTION WILL PUT THE ORIGINATING NODE NUMBER IN THE DNIC, BUT NOT
   THE ORIGINATING PORT NUMBER.

   2)  HOST COST STATEMENTS TO THE SUPERVISOR

   Page 33 of the X.25/X.75 Reference Manual states:

   "The time interval between the (HOST COST) reports to the Supervisor will 
   be at least 15 seconds."

   The Host Cost value is checked every 15 seconds, but it is reported to the
   Supervisor only when it has changed.  The Host Cost statement parameters 
   determine how many users logging on or off are needed to make a change.

   WARNING:  If the HOSTCOST Statement doesn't succeed in leveling the load to
   targetted hosts, be sure the node housing the destination host has Pass-
   throughs enabled, or the line cost to that host will be prohibitive and 
   calls will not be routed to it.  This is to be changed by a new release of
   Supervisor code.

   3)  TCNL(NONE) PROBLEM WITH MORE THAN ONE LINK

   The 2-Way Channel Statement (page 52) of the X.25/X.75 Reference Manual 
   says:

   "The statement TCNL(NONE) may be used to specify that there will be no 
   two-way channels."

   This works when there is just one link specified in the TYMFILE.  There
   was a problem when 256 DPORTs were distributed over 2 links with 128 on
   each link.  All channels were to be incoming with no two-way channels.  The
   TCNL(NONE) statement caused a fatal sysgen error because the code inserted
   values for low and high two-way channels on link 0.  Currently, the only 
   way to avoid this error is to allow at least 1 two-way channel on Link 0.

      WHEN ORDERING CMT, PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IN THE
   COMMENTS SECTION OF THE "SYNC" SCREEN:

   1.  TOTAL NUMBER OF PRINTERS (DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN NUMBER OF PRINTERS
       USED SIMULTANEOUSLY).  IF THE CUSTOMER WILL NOT BE USING PRINTERS
       WITH THE CMT, PLEASE STATE TOTAL PRINTERS = 0.

   2.  TOTAL NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TERMINAL TYPES (EX:  3 TERMINAL TYPES).

   THIS INFORMATION IS ESSENTIAL TO THE ALLOCATION OF MEMORY.  EFFECTIVE
   IMMEDIATELY, THIS INFORMATION IS REQUIRED ON ALL ORDERS FOR CMT.

   1.  As part of my ongoing efforts to give you ALL the information
   you need to SELL Async to 3270 I'd like to ask you to please add
   the following important information regarding printer support to
   your Product Marketing Guide, Vol. III, page 300.50.105 under the
   Printer Option chart.
 
                               ADDENDUM
   ****NOTE:  OPTIONS 2, AND 3 REQUIRE UNIQUE NETWORK USER
              NAMES FOR EACH PAIR OF CRT AND PRINTER.  OPTION 4
              REQUIRES  A UNIQUE NETWORK USER NAME FOR EVERY
              PRINTER. IF YOU DO NOT DO THIS THE IBM HOST WILL HAVE
              NO WAY OF KNOWING WHAT PRINTER BELONGS TO WHAT CRT
              USER.  THE END RESULT IS THAT END USERS GET
              MISDIRECTED PRINT JOBS
 
   2. IBM Public Net Slide Show
   If you have this great new show in your office please remove
   slides 27 and 28 for FastEdit/International and Color Support
   until development completion dates are firmed up.  I'll let you
   know when you can talk to customers about these features again.

      The Tymnet 2780/3780 HASP Interface provides support for RSCS/VMB proto-
   cols.  Hardware and software changes are not required at the host computer.
   Switched or nonswitched host ports are supported.  Connection between hosts
   through the Network will be by means of Permanent Virtual Circuits (PVC's).
   The PVC between two hosts will be built at slot initialization time for 
   unswitched lines or upon detection of DSR for switched lines.  The inter-
   connection of the hosts will be specified at System Generation time.

   This interface supports a maximum of eight 9600 BPS links using standard
   synchronous ports.  This interface provides good batch throughput.  Local
   acknowledgement insure contineous flow through the network.  The last block
   of every file being sent uses end-to-end acknowledgment.  This provides 
   data entigrity should a fatal error occur during file transmission.  If 
   data is lost due to fatal error, the host retransmits the file.

   RSCS have I/O configurations.  The minimum configuration consists of a
   card reader, a printer and a card punch machine.

   The core requirement for ports are +10K for static and +7K for per line.

   This interface is supported on BBXS05.01 or above version. I am including
   a sample Tymfile for your information.

                 DEPLOYING MULTI-TARGET HOSTS IN THE NETWORK

      When deploying multi-target hosts in the network, it should be ensured
   that only one host is assigned per node.  The Supervisor code is not 
   designed to handle two or more multi-target hosts on the same node.  If
   this happens, only one of the hosts will be considered (depending on the
   sequence of host numbers in the user profile) and the rest of the hosts, on
   the node, will be ignored.

   It should also be ensured that for the nodes on which the multi-target 
   hosts are based, the PTHRU (passthrough flag) parameter is not disabled,
   i.e., passthroughs should be allowed by turning PTHRU to zero.  This is a
   limitation in the current Supervisor.  The Supervisor calculates very high
   costs to destination nodes that are out of passthroughs.  As a result, no
   calls would be routed to hosts based on such nodes.  This limitation will 
   be removed from future Supervisor releases.  The code to handle this is
   curently being tested.

      In addition to the "Q" command not working, the Tymshare model 923 does
   not have the ability to accurately process (at its command level) a dial
   string coming from an X.75 gateway.  Two (2) VEN-TEL 212 PLUSII ver 2.20
   modems have been tested in this configuration and have passed.  (The "Q"
   command works on this model too).  If your customer is logging on through 
   an X.75 gateway and you are unable to install the VEN-TEL 212 PLUSII ver 
   2.20, I cautiously recommend pre-programming the dial string in the 
   Tymshare model 923's memory.  If you have any questions regarding this
   issue, please ontyme NSS.WING.

   Special Note - The Tymshare model 925, fitted with version 2.20 proms, is
   the equivalent to the VEN-TEL 212 PLUSII ver 2.20 modem.

      Async Outdial Service is becoming a more popular project.  I have
   noticed, though, that Communication Consultants and Field Engineers have
   not been briefed on how this service works.  Implementation of this
   service has been confused.  Allow me to propose a couple tips so that you
   do not get caught by surprise.

   1)  All field offices should have received a bundle of "Asynchronous Out-
       dial User's Guide" pamphlets.  If your office has not received any, or
       has run out, you can order more through publications.  Reading this
       guide, is an excellent orientation to the product and a handy reference
       guide.

   2)  There are a couple of Outdial demo slots that you can log into to get a
       feel of how the product works.  The username is 'OUTDIALDEMO', the host
       numbers are 7015, 7017, or 7019, and the password is 'demo'.  If you
       get a 'host out of ports' message, try another host or try again in a
       couple minutes since there is only one port available per slot at this
       time.

       When you make a successful connection, type a 'H' for help at the '$'
       prompt.  A list of modem commands will be displayed.  Enter the nearest
       local access number and dial it.  For Newport Beach (host 7015) use
       7568341.  For New York (host 7017) use 6898850.  For Valley Forge (host
       7019) use 6669190.  When you receive the "ONLINE!" banner from the 
       modem and the network "please type your terminal identifier" message,
       logon to a Tymnet PDP10 system to simulate a completed call.  Please
       remember to logoff so that the port will be available for others to
       use.

   3)  For generating code, there are files on systems 33 and 70 in the 
       techserv directory that you can refer to.  They are OTDIAL.DOC,
       SAMPLE.T01, OTDIAL.T01, GENOTD.DOC, and OTDIAL.C01.

      THIS WEEKEND (DECEMBER 13 - 15), WE WILL BE IMPLEMENTING THE MOVE OVER 
   TO FOUR (4) PUBLIC NETWORK CODE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS.  PLEASE NOTE THE 
   FOLLOWING:


   DIRECTORY                (TYMNET)                   (TYM4000)
                            nodes less than 4000       nodes 4000 and above


   PRIMARY SYSTEM/          25 - DALLAS KL             54 - DALLAS KL
   LOADING SYSTEM

   BACKUP SYSTEM            70 - CUPERTINO KI          33 - CUPERTINO KL


   IN PREPARATION FOR THE MOVE, REGIONAL DIRECTORIES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED
   AS PER THE NEW BACKUP PROCEDURES.  THEY WILL BE UTILIZED AS FOLLOWS:


   REGION                      REGIONAL DIRECTORY          CONTACT
   ------                      -------- ---------          -------

   WEST                        CENTCODE                    DEE HALBROOK
   WEST                        WATECH                      KUSHI KULLAR
   EAST                        (UNAVAILABLE)               CLAIR STAUFFER
   EXTERNAL NETWORK TECH       INTLTECH                    JEFF OLIVETO


   AS YOU ARE ALL AWARE, PER EILEEN RIORDAN'S RECENT MEMO, ALL REGIONAL 
   DIRECTORIES ARE VALIDATED ON ALL (4) SYSTEMS.  THE COMMUNICATIONS 
   CONSULTANT WILL PLACE THEIR SLOT CODE FROM THEIR PERSONAL DIRECTORIES INTO
   THE REGIONAL DIRECTORY ON THE CORRECT SYSTEM (25 OR 54) DEPENDING ON THE 
   NODE NUMBER.  CODE GENERATION WILL THEN RENAME THE CODE FROM THE REGIONAL
   DIRECTORY INTO THE TYMNET OR TYM4000 DIRECTORY UPON RECEIPT OF A BACKUP 
   REQUEST.  A GENERIC SKELETON FOR BACKUP REQUESTS IS LOCATED ON (TYMNET:25)
   BACKUP.SKL.  PLEASE ENSURE THAT ALL INFORMATION SUBMITTED IS COMPLETE AND 
   ACCURATE.  ANY BACKUP REQUESTS SENT TO THE WRONG SYSTEM, i.e., backup for 
   node 4500 on system 25, WILL BE REJECTED.  I REALIZE THAT SOME OF YOU MAY 
   HAVE YOUR OWN BACKUP SKELETONS ALREADY.  PLEASE CONTINUE TO UTILIZE THEM IF
   THEY ARE FOR YOUR BENEFIT, JUST BE SURE THEY INCLUDE ALL INFORMATION 
   REQUESTED IN THE GENERIC SKELETON.

   LAST, A SIMPLE MERLIN PROGRAM WILL BE RUN BY THE CODE GENERATOR TO BIND THE
   SLOT CODE WITH THE NODE CODE.  THE COMMUNICATIONS CONSULTANT WILL BE 
   NOTIFIED VIA THE BACKUP SUMMARY REPORT THAT THEIR BACKUP IS COMPLETE.  WITH 
   THE (4) SYSTEMS IN PLACE, I AM OPTIMISTIC AT COMPLETING BACKUP REQUESTS
   WITHIN (24) HOURS ON THE PRIMARY/LOADING SYSTEMS AND (48) HOURS ON THE 
   PUBLIC NETWORK BACKUP SYSTEMS.

   FOR A SMOOTH TRANSITION, I AM REQUESTING THAT THE FIELD SUBMIT BACKUP 
   REQUESTS THE 'OLD WAY' THRU WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 11.  AS OF THURSDAY, 
   DECEMBER 12, ANY BACKUPS SENT TO TYMOPS.BACKUP SHOULD BE SENT TO THE 
   CORRECT SYSTEM (AS SPECIFIED ABOVE).  ALL BACKUPS SENT THURSDAY AND FRIDAY
   (DECEMBER 12 - 13) WILL BE PROCESSED ON THE NEW SYSTEMS MONDAY, DEC 16.  
   THE TIMING IS CRUCIAL TO MEET THE BATCH REQUESTS WE ARE SUBMITTING ON 
   FRIDAY, DECEMBER 13.  YOUR COOPERATION WILL BE MUCH APPRECIATED.  

   AT THIS TIME, IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO ASK THE COMMUNICATIONS CONSULTANT TO 
   HAVE THEIR CODE AVAILABLE AT TIME OF INSTALL.  GENERAL CONSENSUS FROM THE 
   FIELD IS THAT SLOT CODE IS UNIQUE TO EACH INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER GIVEN THE 
   VARIOUS OPTIONS, THUS ADDITIONAL CHANGES TO THE SLOT CODE AFTER THE INSTALL
   IS NOT UNUSUAL.  THIS TOPIC MAY BE PURSUED AT A LATER DATE.

   PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO CALL ME AT (408)942-5180 IF YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER
   QUESTIONS.  REVISED CODE GENERATION PROCEDURES WILL BE RELEASED AFTER THE
   MOVE HAS BEEN COMPLETED.  

   HERE'S TO SYSTEM AVAILABILITY AND IMPROVED RESPONSE TIME.  THANK YOU FOR
   YOUR COOPERATION AND CONTINUED SUPPORT.

      I have released a temp patch, DSPHIF.PAT, which is used to fix DSP out 
   of sequence problem (in CMT, you see HOST ERROR CODE 2) for PBH 7.02/7.03.
   The formal patch has been released to SOURCE p00 file. Please remove
   DSPHIF.PAT from your command file and regen your code with the new release.
   Do it ASAP especially if you have native mode or CMT customers. Thanks.

 

   The following tables are the results from running BETATEST version 2.06 
   that show the size of core memory needed to run 3270 CMT with different
   combinations of devices attached to the network.

   To use the table, go to the table with the number of terminal type
   (DEFTRM=1,10,19) that you have selected that can be used to the network.
   The columns of the table select the printer attached to the network and the
   rows select the terminal users.  The intersection of PR USER and CRT USER 
   is the size in decimal kilobytes of core memory needed to run 3270 CMT 
   interface.

Written by : Ping Chu, HQ Network Staff Consultant
      Date : JULY 25, 1985
 
 
 
 
      THIS MEMO SERVES TO INFORM YOU THAT OUR SDLC INTERFACES DO NOT ZAP
   THE PERMANENT VIRTUAL CIRCUIT (PVC) FOR NO REASONS.  WHEN YOU NOTICE THE
   CIRCUIT ZAPPED MESSAGE IN USING THE LOGTABLE COMMAND OF THE SDLC MONITOR, 
   IT MAY BE ISSUED FOR ANY ONE OF THE REASONS:
 
 
 
      UNDER THE FOLLOWING CIRCUMSTANCES, THE  SDLC  INTERFACE WILL SEND AN
   ISIS MESSAGE "9E" DETACH TO DETACH A PERMANENT VIRTUAL CIRCUIT.
 
 
          1.  THE DSR SIGNAL DROPPED ON THE LINE BETWEEN FRONT END 
              PROCESSOR AND THE SDLC HOST INTERFACE.
 
          2.  A MONITOR USER ENTERED THE SHUT COMMAND FOR  A  SPECIFIC
              STATION  VIA  THE MONITOR HOST CO-RESIDING WITH THE SDLC
              HOST INTERFACE.
 
          3.  A MONIOTR USER ENTERED THE SHUT COMMAND TO SHUT THE HOST
              LINE VIA THE MONITOR HOST CO-RESIDING WITH THE SDLC HOST
              INTERFACE.
 
          4.  THE SDLC HOST INTERFACE HAS USED UP  ALL  ITS  AVAILABLE
              PORTS  AND  REPORTS  THE HOST OUT OF PORT MESSAGE TO THE
              SUPERVISOR.  THE HOST INTERFACE WILL NOT HONOR  ANY  NEW
              NEEDLE  REQUESTS  AND  IT  SHALL  DETACH THE NEW CIRCUIT
              WHICH EXISTS BECAUSE OF THE NEW NEEDLE REQUEST.
 
          5.  THE SDLC HOST INTERFACE SENDS THE SELECT DIALECT COMMAND
              -  8080, BUT THE SELECT DIALECT RESPONSE - 8081 DOES NOT
              COME BACK  FROM  THE  TERMINAL  INTERFACE  TO  THE  HOST
              INTERFACE  IN  TIME.  THE HOST INTERFACE WILL NOT ACCEPT
              THIS USER'S NEEDLE REQUEST.  IT WOULD ALSO  DETACH  THIS
              CIRCUIT.
 
          6.  WHEN THE HOST  INTERFACE  RECEIVES  A  ZAPPER  FROM  THE
              NETWORK,  IT  WILL UNCONDITIONALLY SEND A DETACH MESSAGE
              FOR THIS CIRCUIT.
 
          7.  WHEN THE HOST INTERFACE RECEIVES A "C089" CALL USER DATA
              AND  IT  FINDS  OUT THAT THE CONTROL UNIT'S ADDRESS DOES
              NOT MATCH WITH THE PU ADDRESS GENED IN THE TYMFILE.
 
          8.  THE USER TRIES TO LOGON TO THE MONITOR HOST, BUT HIS/HER
              NAME IS NOT ON THE GOODGUY LIST GENED IN THE TYMFILE.
 
          9.  THE SECOND TIME THE USER USES THE SAME USERNAME TO LOGON
              TO  THE  MONITOR  HOST  WHILE THE FIRST CIRCUIT IS STILL
              INTACT.  THE INTERFACE  WILL  DETACH  THE  SECOND  LOGON
              REQUEST.
 
         10.  THE USER LOGS OFF THE MONITOR HOST  BY  TYPING  EXIT  OR
              BYE.  THIS WILL CAUSE THE CIRCUIT BEING DETACHED.
 
         11.  UPON RECEIPT OF AN ISIS MESSAGE "AE" BREAK (SUCH AS  THE
              MONITOR  DEVICE  GETS  POWERED OFF ALL OF A SUDDEN), THE
              INTERFACE WILL DETACH THIS CIRCUIT.
 
 
 
      UNDER THE FOLLOWING SITUATIONS THE SDLC INTERFACE  WILL SEND AN ISIS
   MESSAGE "9F" ZAPPER TO ZAP A PERMANENT VIRTUAL CIRCUIT.
 
 
          1.  AT THE INTIALIZATION TIME, THE INTERFACES CLEAR OUT  ALL
              THE ACTIVE CIRCUITS.
 
          2.  WHEN THE SDLC TERMINAL INTERFACE RECEIVES AN  ISIS  "B5"
              MESSAGE  -  LOGON FAILURE, IT WILL ZAP THE CORRESPONDING
              CIRCUIT.

          3.  THE SDLC TERMINAL INTERFACE HAS ALREADY RECEIVED A  REAL
              PSEUDO  NEEDLE  "B2"  FROM  THE  NODE  CODE, BUT IT THEN
              RECEIVES A SPURIOUS PSEUDO NEEDLE.   IN  THIS  CASE,  IT
              WILL ZAP THE CIRCUIT TO AVOID CONFUSION.
 
          4.  THE DSR SIGNAL DROPPED ON  THE  LINE  BETWEEN  THE  SDLC
              TERMINAL INTERFACE AND THE CONTROL UNIT.
 
          5.  A MONITOR USER ENTERED A SHUT  COMMAND  FOR  A  SPECIFIC
              STATION  VIA  THE MONITOR HOST CO-RESIDING WITH THE SDLC
              TERMINAL INTERFACE.
 
          6.  A MONITOR USER ENTERED A SHUT  COMMAND  FOR  A  TERMINAL
              LINE  VIA  THE  MONITOR  HOST  CO-RESIDING WITH THE SDLC
              TERMINAL INTERFACE.
 
 
 
      WHEN THE SDLC HOST INTERFACE RECOGNIZES THE CIRCUIT BEING ZAPPED, IT
      WILL:
 
 
          1.  RELEASE ALL THE INPUT BUFFERLETS, OUTPUT BUFFERLETS  AND
              THE  COMMAND  LINK  LISTS  WHICH  ARE  FLOWING  FROM THE
              BACKGROUND PROCESSING TO THE  FOREGROUND.   PLEASE  NOTE
              THAT  WHATEVER  DATA  SITTING  IN THE SIO BUFFERS REMAIN
              INTACT.  IN OTHER WORDS, THE SIO MOTHERBOARD WILL TRY TO
              TRANSMIT WHATEVER QUEUED UP IN ITS SIO TRASNMIT BUFFER.
 
          2.  SEND AN ISIS "9E"  DETACH  MESSAGE  TO  DISCONNECT  THIS
              USER.
 
 
 
      WHEN THE SDLC TERMINAL INTERFACE RECOGNIZES THE CIRCUIT BEING ZAPPED,
   IT WILL:
 
 
          1.  RELEASE ALL THE INPUT BUFFERLETS, OUTPUT BUFFERLETS  AND
              THE  COMMAD  LINK  LISTS  WHICH  ARE  FLOWING  FROM  THE
              BACKGROUND PROCESSING TO THE  FOREGROUND.   PLEASE  NOTE
              THAT  WHATEVER  DATA  SITTING  IN THE SIO BUFFERS REMAIN
              INTACT.  IN OTHER WORDS, THE SIO MOTHERBOARD WILL TRY TO
              TRANSMIT WHATEVER QUEUED UP IN ITS SIO TRANSMIT BUFFER.
 
          2.  INCREMENT THE LOGON RETRY COUNTER BY ONE.
 
          3.  IF WE HAVE NOT EXCEEDED THE LIMIT OF LOGON RETRY,  WHICH
              PRESENTLY IS HARDCODED TO 16 TIMES,
 
                      THEN THE TERMINAL INTERFACE WILL WAIT UNTIL  THE
                      PVCTIMER  TO  TIMEOUT;   WHICH IS DEFINED IN THE
                      TYMFILE.  AFTER THIS TIMER POPS,  IT  STARTS  TO
                      BUILD  THE  PVC  BY  SENDING  THE  PSEUDO NEEDLE
                      REQUEST AGAIN TO THE NODE CODE.
 
 
          4.  OTHERWISE;  THE TERMINAL INTERFACE REPORTS  THE  MESSAGE
              OF  EXCESSIVE  LOGON  RETRY TO THE SUPERVISOR'S LOG, AND
              SHUT OFF THIS STATION BY CLEARING THE CIRCUIT.

      IN THE SNA WORLD, WHEN A HALF-SESSION SENDS DATA TO ITS CORRESPONDING
   SESSION PARTNER, IT HAS NO WAY OF KNOWING IF THE SESSION PARTNER HAS
   RECEIVED THE DATA UNLESS IT IS ACKNOWLEDGED BY A RESPONSE.
 
      THERE ARE 3 TYPES OF RESPONSE PROTOCOLS IN THE SNA WORLD:
 
              1.  DEFINITE RESPONSE
                       THE SENDER REQUESTS THE RECEIVER  TO  RETURN  A
                  RESPONSE   UNCONDITIONALLY,   WHETHER   POSITIVE  OR
                  NEGATIVE, TO THAT REQUEST.
 
              2.  EXCEPTION RESPONSE
                       THE RECEIVER RETURNS A NEGATIVE  RESPONSE  ONLY
                  IF  THE RECEIVED DATA IS UNACCEPTABLE;  OTHERWISE IT
                  DOES NOT RESPOND AT ALL.
 
              3.  NO RESPONSE
                       NO MATTER THE RECEIVED DATA  IS  ACCEPTABLE  OR
                  UNACCEPTABLE,  THE  RECEIVER DOES NOT RESPOND TO THE
                  SENDER.
 
 
      THE USAGE OF THESE RESPONSES ARE ILLUSTRATED AS FOLLOWS:
 
              1.  RESPONSES  ARE  RETURNED  IF  THE  SESSION   PARTNER
                  REQUESTS FOR DEFINITE RESPONSES.

               FOR  EVERY  SNA  MESSAGE,  IT  IS  PREFIXED  WITH   THE
          TRANSMISSION HEADER AND THE REQUEST/RESPONSE HEADER.  
               IN THE REQUEST HEADER, THERE ARE THREE BITS  INDICATING
          THE  TYPES  OF RESPONSES (I.E., DEFINITE RESPONSE, EXCEPTION
          RESPONSE, AND NO RESPONSE)  THAT  THE  SENDING  HALF-SESSION
          REQUESTS    FOR    THE    ACKNOWLEDGEMENT    OF   THIS   SNA
          REQUEST-MESSAGE.

               IN THE RESPONSE HEADER, THERE  IS  ONE  BIT  INDICATING
          WHETHER  THIS SNA RESPONSE-MESSAGE IS A POSITIVE RESPONSE OR
          A NEGATIVE ONE.
               IT  MAY  INCREASE  UNNECESSARY  LINE  TRAFFIC  IF   THE
          CUSTOMER  USES  THE  DEFINITE  RESPONSE  PROTOCOLS  FOR  ALL
          TRANSMISSIONS.  THE SNA DOES ALLOW, IN  FACT  IT  IMPLICITLY
          RECOMMENDS,  TO  USE A COMBINATION OF DEFINITE AND EXCEPTION
          RESPONSES TO ELIMINATE THE UNNECESSARY TRAFFIC DELAY.

               AS YOU MAY BE ABLE TO POINT IT OUT FROM THIS CHART THAT
          THE SNA PROTOCOL ENFORCES THE DEFINITE RESPONSE TO BE ISSUED
          FOR EVERY OUTSTANDING REQUEST MESSAGE IN THE SSCP-PU SESSION
          AND THE SSCP-LU SESSION.
               HOWEVER, THE PROTOCOL ALLOWS THE RESPONSE TO BE IN  ANY
          ONE  OF THE FORM OF DEFINITE RESPONSE, EXCEPTION RESPONSE OR
          NO RESPONSE FOR EVERY OUTSTANDING  REQUEST  MESSAGE  IN  THE
          LU-LU SESSION.
 
               ONCE  WE  HAVE  GONE  THROUGH   THE   SSCP-LU   SESSION
          ESTABLISHMENT AND PROCEED TO THE LU-LU SESSION, THE POSSIBLE
          DELAY CAUSED BY THE END-TO- END ACKNOWLEDGEMENT, WHICH IS  A
          MUST  IN  THE SSCP-PU OR SSCP-LU SESSIONS, CAN BE ELIMINATED
          BY  ADAPTING  A  MIXTURE  OF  THE  DEFINITE  RESPONSES   AND
          EXCEPTION RESPONSES.
 
               IF YOUR SDLC CUSTOMERS EVER HAVE COMPLAINTS  ABOUT  THE
          SLOW  RESPONSE  TIME  WHEN THEY USE THE SDLC INTERFACES, YOU
          MAY ADVISE THEM TO RESEARCH THEIR IBM VTAM GEN AND  THE  WAY
          THEIR  TRANSACTION-ORIENTED PROGRAMS ISSUE CALLS TO THE CICS
          OR IMS, OR TSO, OR OTHER MAJOR APPLICATION SYSTEMS.
 
               IN THE IBM VTAM  GEN,  THERE  IS  A  SET  OF  PARAMETER
          SETTINGS  TO  DEFINE THE BIND IMAGE.  THIS MACRO IS LOGMODE.
          UNDER THIS MACRO, IT LEAVES ROOM FOR THE VTAM PROGRAMMERS TO
          DEFINE  THE  FUNCTION  MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS FOR BOTH PRIMARY
          LOGICAL UNIT AND SECONDARY LOGICAL UNIT.   IN  THE  FUNCTION
          MANAGEMENT  PROTOCOL, IT ALSO PERMITS ANY COMBINATIONS OF NO
          RESPONSE, DEFINITE RESPONSE AND EXCEPTION RESPONSE.
 
               IN ADDITION TO OPTIMIZING THE LOGMODE PARAMETERS OF THE
          VTAM GEN, THE IBM MAJOR APPLICATION SYSTEMS ALSO PLAY A VERY
          IMPORTANT ROLE IN SPEEDING UP THE  COMMUNICATION  ROUND-TRIP
          TRAFFIC.   THESE  MAJOR  APPLICATION SYSTEMS SUCH AS CICS OR
          IMS, WHEN ISSUE THE SEND MACRO CALL TO  VTAM,  THEY  HAVE  A
          CHOICE  TO  TELL  VTAM  WHETHER THE APPLICATION SYSTEM SHALL
          EXPECT A DEFINITE  RESPONSE  OR  EXCEPTION  RESPONSE  OR  NO
          RESPONSE  TO  THE  SENDING  MESSAGE.  THEREFORE, THE NETWORK
          ROUND-TRIP DELAY CAN BE IMPROVED BY CICS ASKING AN EXCEPTION
          RESPONSE IN THE SEND MACRO.
 
               AFTER THE BIND IS SENT TO THE SECONDARY  LOGICAL  UNIT,
          BOTH HALF SESSION PARTNERS HAVE TO BE IN CONFORMITY WITH THE
          BINDING AGREEMENT.  THERE IS NO WAY  TO  ALTER  THE  BINDING
          AGREEMENT IN THE LU-LU SESSION.
 
               TYMNET  SDLC  INTERFACES  PROVIDE  AN  EXTENSION   CORD
          SERVICE  TO  THE  SDLC  USERS.   IT  DOES NEITHER SNA-TO-BSC
          PROTOCOL CONVERSION NOR SNA PROTOCOL VALIDATION.  IT  CHECKS
          WHATEVER  IS  DEFINED IN THE SDLC-LAYER'S PROTOCOL, WHICH IS
          VERY  MINIMAL  AS  OPPOSED  TO  OTHER   FIVE   UPPER-LAYERS'
          PROTOCOLS.   IT  SIMPLY PASSES WHATEVER IT RECEIVES FROM ONE
          END TO ANOTHER.  THEREFORE, IT DOES NOT WASTE TIME IN MAKING
          SURE  THAT  THE  USER  DATA CONFORMS TO THE PROTOCOLS OF SNA
          UPPER-LAYERS.

               PRESENT BACK-PRESSURE HANDLING IN THE SUPERVISOR
               ------------------------------------------------
               ------------------------------------------------


Written by : Ashok Chippa, HQ Network Staff Consultant
      Date : December 12, 1985




   PRESENT BACK-PRESURE HANDLING IN THE SUPERVISOR   
     
   1) There are two back-pressure control rings in the Sup to  
      pass bp (back-pressure) information to the node code (on 
      Sup base)   
           a) Input bp control ring   
           b) Output bp control ring  
     
   2) The Sup relieves bp before sending a T-I or T-II needle  
      for command circuit or before taking over a T-i or T-II  
      node through a T-II neighbour.  
     
   3) The Sup bp's a port if it receives early takeover response    
      errors from a node and during remove and retake processing.   
     
   4) The Sup processes bp information from the node code in the    
      input bp ring immediately before sending anything into the    
      output data ring. If the Sup receives any bp information for  
      a port which is out of range, the Sup will crash. Otherwise,  
      the Sup will set or relieve bp for that port.  
     
   5) The node code will not send anything on ports that have been  
      bp'ed by the Sup.
     
   6) The node code bp's the Sup if when moving the Sup data into   
      the network, a buffer's byte count exceeds an arbitrary  
      circuit speed of 3 (0400 bytes). Every pass through 'spider', 
      after all the Sup input and output processing, the node code  
      checks all the Sup channels previously bped and if their 
      byte counts do not exceed their circuit speeds as indicated   
      in the i/o table, then bp is relieved for the channel.   
      Following this check the output bp ring is checked for   
      indications of bp set or relief from the Sup.  
        
           From the above summary it is clear that presently the    
      Sup back-pressure is not related or connected in any way 
      to the number of free available bufferlets.    
     
   PRESENT HANDLING OF NUMBER OF FREE BUFFERLETS
     
   1) Total number of free bufferlets (NFREE) is maintained    
      constantly. This is because NFREE is updated whenever    
      a bufferlet or a list of bufferlets is withdrawn or 
      returned to the free pool. 
     
   2) NFREE is initialized to BLETSIZ (total) in the beginning.
     
   3) When transferring nodes from State 2 to 3 of takeover    
      NFREE is checked, and the transfer is carried only if    
      enough bufferlets are available.
     
   4) During the input dispatcher processing if NFREE is less  
      than 256d, the Sup tries tries to free up some bufferlets
      by calling OTROUT.    
     
   5) T-II logins are accepted only if NFREE is less than 200d.
     
   6) T-I logins are accepted only if NFREE is less than 200d. 
     
   7) When sending message strings to T-I node if NFREE is not 
      enough a 'bell' is sent instead.
     
   8) When sending message strings to T-II node if NFREE is not
      enough a 'bell' is sent instead.
     
   9) Auxiliary circuits are not started if NFREE is less than 250d.
        
   10) NFREE is updated in list handlers and therefore is 
       maintained constantly.    
     
   11) Rebuild requests are not accepted if NFREE is less than 200x.
     
           It is apparent that NFREE is checked for only certain    
      lists. For example NFREE is not checked while appending  
      zappers to the zapper list (zapper list is used only if T-I   
      nodes are present). Since TRW's problem is related to this, it
      is possible to modify this area to ignore zappers if NFREE    
      is less than some safe level. This would then require that    
      nodes resend the zappers at a later time. This may require    
      additional code changes to either node code or slot code 
      generating zaps. 
     
           The second approach of back-pressuring the messages from 
      a node when NFREE is low is more complicated and may require  
      additional protocols for the Sup and node communications and  
      substantial node code and Sup code changes.    
     
            Both these approaches have to be studied at a design    
      level and will require a PIR to NTD. 
     
           A new feature is added to the Sup to report the number   
      of free bufferlets to the error log every 30 minutes.    
     
           A quick and dirty solution is to increase the number of  
      of bufferlets to as much as the memory can permit.  
     
           The long term and the best solution is to eliminate 
      T-I nodes from the network.

     The following formula can be used to estimate the memory requirements
     for TMCS version 10.00 code generation.  It should give you a  number 
     very  close  to  (or always on the safe side) that  obtained  by code 
     generation.

   ************************************************************************

                  And now, an X.25 that can't be beat!

   X.25 V3.01 is now in Full Release in the Public Network. Version 3.01
   includes significant enhancements over the previous release versions. 
   We're certain that our customers will be more satisfied than ever with
   this new release!

   The following new external and internal features will appear in V3.01:

   o  Permanent Virtual Circuits (PVC's) as specified in the CCITT X.25
      recommendation is now available.

   o  Throughput performance has improved.

   o  Reverse Charging can be forced to occur if a calling address contains
      a match with a specified character string.

   o  Improved debugging facilities allow selection of specific debugging
      functions such as packet buffer trace, packet trace and link trace, and
      repeat a selected sequence.

   o  The maximum number of simultaneous circuits is increased to 1024.

   o  Called and Calling Address Modification can be performed on addresses
      for networks when address requirements differ between networks. This
      is primarily for private networks and international gateways and gives
      the customer more flexibility for interconnections.

   o  A logical break key other than the "break key" can be specified as
      the break signal from the start-stop DTE for X.3 parameter 7. This
      gives the end user additional keyboard independence when accessing 
      the network.

   o  An assembly time ID can be specified containing the current date and
      time so that the NAD (Node Assembler/Debugger) symbols can be matched
      with the slot file.

   Preliminary formal documentation is available for some of the newly
   implemented features. These documents are available on System 39
   and are intended for Tymnet internal use only.  They are
   oriented towards the Communications Consultant and include
   detailed discussions of the features, as well as Tymfile generation
   statements. These documents are:

   (NETMID:39)PREFIX.DOC       International Prefix Feature Documentation

   (NETMID:39)RVCHG.DOC        Reverse Charge Forcing for Tymshare
                               X.25/X.75 Interface
   
   (NETMID:39)PVC.DOC          XCOM - PVC Feature for X.25 Interface
   
   (NETMID:39)CLDMAP.DOC       Called DTE address mapping

   Also, be sure to check your previous Baseline memos and Tech Alert
   files for technical information about features in the new release.

   In addition to the preliminary documents are the standard X.25/X.75
   publications manuals. These are:

   We are currently updating the V2.02 Reference Manual and will let
   you know when the new version becomes available. In addition, we are
   working on a X.75 Gateway Connection Guide which should be available
   early in 1986. 

   As with any Full Release, no restrictions exist for ordering. All new
   X.25 orders placed through Order Processsing will be filled with
   V3.01. Additionally, we recommend that you begin to migrate your
   present X.25 customers to the new release version, so that they may
   benefit from the improvements.

   Well, there it is. Now it's your turn to hit the streets and
   tell the world: "we've got an X.25 for you!"

      A patch is now available to provide realtime display of X.PC packet 
   information through Extended DDT. This can make the process of trouble-
   shooting X.PC problems somewhat easier and quicker. The patch can be 
   installed in any version 1.04 or 1.05 X.PC Network Server - and is already
   installed in those Servers in the public network answering to host number 
   7132 (username XPC, among others).

   To Use:

    - Enter Extended DDT for the given Server. "?STAT" at the DDT prompt.
    - Enter "DPTF" at the Extended DDT prompt, ":>".
    - Any further keyboard input will terminate the display, and return you
      the ":>" prompt.

   The Output:

    - Fields are self explanatory (assuming you've read the X.PC Field Guide*).
      with the following exception.
    - The field labeled "IN/OUT" is coded:
      00 = Input to the Server
      01 = Output from the Server
      02 = Input having a bad packet-trailer CRC
      9E+ = ISIS Control Msg.

   The patchfile is: (techserv:25/33/54/70)ptfddt.pat, and should be assembled
   after any other patchfiles.

          MORE THINGS YOU WANT(?) TO KNOW ABOUT X.25 AND XCOM 

     FOR WATCHFUL XCOM CODE 'GEN'ers:

     If you use the CLGADR Sysgen Statement with the 'adr' 
     option, you may have noticed that the message doesn't get printed
     correctly during assembly of the XCOM03.R01 module.  Instead of 
     printing the address you used for the 'adr', you see what
     appears to be garbage.

     The problem is only with the gen message.  The macro statement
     used to print the parameter data is coded incorrectly.  

     What was requested:  CLGADR(-NUIADR,310601234500)
     What was printed:  CLGADR(-NUIADR,CLGM|QL|)

          CLGM|QL| is an expression that should have been
     evaluated as 310601234500 and not printed verbatim.

     The data in the NIB file is correct.
     This error in the gen print out should not cause any problems 
     with the operation of the code.

     This cannot be fixed by a patch since it is genned before the patch
     file is activated.  It will be fixed in future releases of XCOM.

     Thanks to John Bell for spotting this.


       **** EXTRA DATA IN CALL USER DATA FIELD CAUSING ERROR

     Data in the Call Request Packet will be handled as follows:

     If there is no data in the CALL USER DATA, and TKSUP option is set,
       and if the called address does not include a destination host --
       the customer will see a PLEASE LOG IN message.  If there is data
       in the CUD and no called address with destination host, the 
       CUD data will be used to form the USERNAME.

     When the CUD field contained (47 32), which was not a valid
     username, an error message and "Please Log In" was returned.

     There are three ways to avoid this:
       1.  After the DNIC, include a valid NTN
           (Network Terminal Number) in the called address.
           In this case, the format "9 + <1 to 9 digits>" indicates a
           2- to 10-digit Network User Number that is used as a
           username.  (See X.25/X.75 Reference Manual, page 7)

       2.  Make data in the CUD a valid username.

       3.  Have NO data in the CUD if you want the PLEASE LOG IN message.



        **** WHEN YOU CAN'T USE THE BRIEF CALL ACCEPT PACKET

     When either Window Size Negotiation or Packet Size Negotiation
     is defined, the Call Accept Packet must be able to
     respond to the window or packet size requested.  The Brief Call
     Accept Packet consists of three octets only -- General Format 
     Identifier, Logical Channel Number and Packet Type Identifier--
     so there is no way to include the Packet Size or Window Size
     facility.  See X.25/X.75 Reference Manual, page 59 (Packet Size
     Statement, +Negotiation option) which says,          
         "Always includes PS facility in the call accept packet."

     The Brief Call Accept Packet cannot be used if either Window
     or Packet Size Negotiation is desired.  The full Call Accept
     Packet is required to carry the negotiation information.


        **** HELPING OUT UNFRIENDLY CUSTOMER SOFTWARE

     When a customer's X.25 PAD did not insert a calling address
     into the Call Request Packet sent to the interface, the call 
     was cleared for improper calling address.  Since it was 
     difficult for the customer to change, TYMNET came to the rescue
     with a solution--use the CHECK CALLING ADDRESS statement
     CHKCLG(adr) where 'adr' represents the beginning digits of
     the calling address in a call request from the Link.

     The main purpose of this statement appears to be to check
     the validity of the calling address in call request packets
     from the link to the interface.  Indeed, if the digits in
     'adr' do not match the digits of the calling address, the
     call will be cleared.  But IF THERE ARE NO DIGITS IN THE
     CALLING ADDRESS FIELD OF THE CALL REQUEST PACKET, 'adr'
     WILL BE SUBSTITUTED.  See X.25/X.75 Reference Manual, page 55.
     
     Thanks to Grace Intres and Mike Hanna for this information.



        **** BIG PROBLEMS WITH BIG GENS FOR XCOM VERSION 2.02

     When you get a fatal assembly error with data out
     of range when you are genning a XCOM Version 2.02 system,
     check how many DPORTS you have specified.  Version 2.02
     is limited in size.  There is no way to patch.  You may as
     well move to 3.01 and beat the crowd.  2.02 is due to expire
     next April anyway.
     BIGGER AND BETTER WITH 3.01, NOW IN FULL RELEASE.

      THIS DOCUMENT DESCRIBES HOW THE SUPERVISOR INTERPRETS AND ACTS UPON
   CHARACTERS FOUND WITHIN A PASSWORD STRING.  APPARENTLY THERE IS NO 
   LIMITATION UPON THE PASSWORD STRING AS PRESENTED TO THE MUD FROM NETVAL
   SO THIS IS THE ONLY GOVERNING FORCE OVER PASSWORD SET UP.

   ALL VALUES GIVEN IS HEXADECIMAL.

   RULE 1.  IF CHARACTER FOUND IS '03' CIRCUIT IS ZAPPED.

   RULE 2.  AFTER CHECKING FOR '03', ALL CHARACTERS ARE LOGICALLY AND
   	         WITH '7F'.  THUS CHARACTERS '80' - 'FF' ARE INTERPRETED
   	          AS '00 - '7F' IN THE FOLLOWING RULES.

   RULE 3.  '00' HAS NO INTERPRETATION AND IS IGNORED.

   RULE 4.  '01' - '0C' ARE ALLOWED.  ('03' EXCEPTED BECAUSE OF RULE 1 ABOVE,
                 '83' ALLOWED).

   RULE 5.  '0D' WILL TERMINATE THE PASSWORD STRING.

   RULE 6.  '0E' - '1A' ARE ALLOWED.

   RULE 7.  '1B' - '1F' ARE INTERPRETED AS ESCAPE (ABORT LOGIN).

   RULE 8.  '20' - '3A' ARE ALLOWED.

   RULE 9.  '3B' - WILL TERMINATE PASSWORD STRING.  I CAN FIND NO FUNCTIONAL
                 DIFFERENCE WITH '0D' AT THIS TIME.

   RULE 10. '3C' - '5F' ARE ALLOWED.

   RULE 11. '60' - '7A' ARE ALLOWED BUT ARE INTERPRETED AS '40' - 5A'.

   RULE 12. '7B' - '7D' ARE INTERPRETED AS '1B' CAUSING ESCAPE.

   RULE 13. '7E' IS INTERPRETED AS '1D' CAUSING ESCAPE.

   RULE 14. '7F' IS INTERPRETED AS '00' AND IS IGNORED.

      The following is a procedure written by Greg Matoka of NTD, you will be
   able to read out from the disk the contents of the registers at the time of
   the supervisor slot crash.  Please send me a copy of the contents of the 
   registers and the location of the supervisor files.  Please ontymn me if 
   you have further questions.


   When analyzing sup crashes, the following steps should be taken:

   1) Freeze the sup. 

   2) Build a circuit through NAD to the sup, and set up the proper NIB file.

   3) Save the current data area to disk with ":sdsav3,savdsz/4,0".  Then load
      the crashed data area from disk into memory with ":ldsav1,savdsz/4,0".

   4) Read out the contents of the registers with ":m1,crsave,crsave+48",
      ":x1,4,2"

   5) Find out the crash location in relation to a label, e.g., if the crash
      occurred at 0DFE3E, (which will be displayed in the Probe log, told to 
      you by NETCON, or else contained in the word following R15 of the crash
      registers), then do a "0DFE3E_  LSCANI+18".

   6) As far as hints to help analyze the crash, here are my suggestions:
        a) Go to the source code and find out what the sup was doing at
        the time. I.e. was it processing a list structure, handling a
        login, an operator request, building a circuit, etc.

        b) Find out how the sup got to the routine where the crash
        occurred. Usually this is contained in the LINK register (R11)
        and it is usually a very valuable bit of information. Also,
        sometimes a previous LINK reg was stored in a memory location,
   	e.g., CLINK, which can give a trail to the crash routine.

   7) Very Important. When you're finished, be sure to restore the data
      area. This is done with a ":ldsav3,savdsz/4,0". Thaw the sup and inform
      NETCON whether they can run on it or not.

   8) It is difficult to analyze a crash unless you've seen the same crash
      twice. In that way, a definite pattern can be established and will
      eliminate a lot of possibilities.

      EVERY X.25 INTERFACE should have an OUCH patch or, if using

      XCOM Version 3.01, the BETATEST patch file (BETATEST)XCOM03.P01.


     YOU SHOULD EITHER:
     Use the new BETATEST patch file (BETATEST)XCOM03.P01 which
     includes the OUCH patch.........
          HOWEVER
         Use of the BETATEST patch file must be cleared with NTD.
         Check with ERIC BUELL, by ONTYME:  NTD.E/BUELL
                                Or phone:  (408) 446-7874

     OR --
     Add the OUCH patch to your command file
     and continue to use the SOURCE patch file.

     OUCH.301 is on systems 25, 33, 54 and 70 in HQXCOM directory.

     OUCHWK.301 is in the same directory on the same systems.
     This one should be used if you want to use the +HILCN option
     of the PKTOPT sysgen statement.

     Please contact Network Support Services, X.25 Support if you have
     any problems with either of these patches.

        ATTENTION:  Everyone working with CONSAT PAD !!


      Please use the Product ID 'XPAD' when submitting NSR's,

      Escalations or RFI's relating to the PAD functions of

      the CONSAT.  The CONSAT PAD, ISCS04.R00 or ISCS04.R01,

      is now in BETATEST.    Using the ID of XPAD for PAD
  
      functions, rather than ISCS, will make it easier for

      NTD and HQ Network Support to give you prompt service.

           CLARIFICATION FOR THE ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS DOCUMENTATION
           ------------------------------------------------------
           ------------------------------------------------------

      Recently I received an RFI from the field concerning the ACOUNT.DOC, a 
   reference manual describing our network's accounting system, which has been 
   updated as of Nov. 15, '85.  A few questions have arisen since within the
   preface of this document the ACCT2.DOC and Account-II system are referenced
   but with no clear indication explaining what they are.  Therefore I would
   like to share with you some of my knowledge about the legitimacy of these 
   documents and the status of the Account-II system project.


   (1)  About the ACCT2.DOC
    
         - Account-II system is a future system to replace the current
           Account-I system

         - The preliminary system specification is documented in the 
           ACCT2.DOC

         - The actual code implementation has yet to be started since
           considerable amount of changes for various s/w disciplines
           is anticipated within the network, such as RAM, ISIS, Node
           Code and other billing processes, etc.  It is expected the
           transition from the old system to the new one be as trans-
           parent as possible and the customers will be informed ahead
           of the time when such event occurs and be given detailed ins-
           tructions on systems deployment.

         - The major features of Account-II are:

                     0  multiple precision accounting message formats,
                     0  16 bits for host number,
                     0  48 bits for invoice/session number, etc.

         - Conservatively speaking, Account-II will not be in place in the
           public network until late this year or early '87.

         - The private networks will have to be upgraded to conform with
           the new system eventually.

   (2)  About the ACOUNT.DOC

         - The Nov. '84 version is still the great BIBLE.  The Nov. '85
           version was released a little too early for the actual functional
           design of the Consat/Outdial has just been completed.

         - The additional features in the Nov. '85 version primarily document
           the accounting behavior of the upcoming Consat/Outdial service
           which is currrently under development and won't be ready for beta-
           test until May.  In another words, the Nov. '85 document should not
           be accounted as a true reference manual until the Outdial s/w is 
           matured to complement the accounting system.

         - Basically the Outdial will utilize the existing ISIS B7 message to
           report the accounting addendum (to ISIS) for its sessions. (ISIS
           and Node Code will then send the information to the Sup through
           accounting message 14 over command circuit.)

         - I had requested the author of the document to comment properly
           in the Preface where ACOUNT.DOC is mentioned.  it should be worded
           as follows:

           "ACOUNT.DOC This document describes Tymnet accounting and will be
                       superceded by the ACCT2.DOC in the future when the
                       Account-II system is implemented."

      There are two independent "good guy" lists for Tymnet nodes:

         1.  The Isis good guy list for DDT users.

         2.  The Nodecode good guy list for XRAY users.


      The limitations for Nodecode/XRAY version 5.06 are:

         1.  Each entry requires 14 (decimal) bytes,
             (12 bytes are allocated for the username).

         2.  The maximum number of entries is 31 (decimal).


      The limitations for Isis/DDT version 5.08 are:

         1.  Each entry requires 12 (decimal) bytes,
             (8 bytes are allocated for the username).

         2.  The number of entries is not checked,
             i.e. there is no defined maximum.

   IMPORTANT INFORMATION

   1.  The new SNA/CMT full release product does NOT support printers!!!
       We are currently beta testing LU3 printer support for this product.

   2.  The IBM 3101 block mode in the 3270 Bisync host interface can only 
       support the 24PF keys when it is used with an IBM pc and Softerm from 
       Softronic as the terminal device.

   3.  The printer demo now has the Status line support in it.  Log in to 
       cmtdem1 thru cmtdem8 to show your prospects.  You can get additional
       information in the (dndspec:25)cmti.ers.      

      Congratulations are in order for John Gomes terminal verification group.
   They have put 19 products thru the program in 4Q85.  To get a list of all
   Async-to-3270 products (terminals and PC software) get the OnTyme file
   (*** asy/3270.lst or (compete:56)asy3270.lst).  This complete list now
   shows 82 terminals and software products as verified for use with Async-to-
   3270.  At this pace they should go over 100 this quarter.

                CAN A HIF SUPPORT A CU WHICH HAS 255 DEVICES
                --------------------------------------------

      In an IBM protocol, one CU can assign a unique address, up to 32 
   devices as shown below:

              CU or Device #        EBCDIC HEX
              --------------        ----------
                 0                       40
                 1                       C1
                 .                       .
                 .                       .
                31                       5F                            

      For a configuration having more than 32 devices, more CU(s) are 
   required.  To support  255 devices, you have to have at least 8 CUs, each 
   with a maximum of 32 devices defined in the DEFDEV macro.

      When the host accesses a device, it uses the CU address and the DEVICE
   address, defined in the tymfile, to uniquely select this device.  So even
   if we can define all these 255 devices in the tymfile by defining 8 CUs,
   all with the same CU addresses, as each device will have the same CU-DEVICE 
   address combination with 7 other devices, the HOST will have a problem in
   accessing the devices correctly.

             THE USE OF NMPORT, NSCNBF AND NBBFLT IN HIF TYMFILE
             ---------------------------------------------------
             ---------------------------------------------------

      The NMPORT and NSCNBF are only used for the Virtual Host Mode. If you 
   have CMT mode, defining them does not help the performance but does take up 
   memory space while genning the HIF. 
     
      If you let NBBFLT be defaulted and get a warning message during slot 
   gen, that is normal, simply just ignore it. However, if slot gen cannot be
   completed due to lack of memory space, then you need to modify the 
   configuration.

      The default for NBBFLT (# of big bufferlet) is based on the number of 
   lines and ports assigned to the interface. Each bufferlet has a fixed size 
   # of bytes (BBFLSZ=60 HEX). The formula to calculate the default in high 
   level language is:

      if NPORT > NDEVM then
         NBBFLT = (NDEVM + NBILIN*2) * MINBUF + BUFLO
      else
         NBBFLT = (NPORT + NBILIN*2) * MINBUF + BUFLO
      endif
      NBBFLT = NBBFLT + 80 (to insure got enough)


      (NBBFLT EQ -1 is a way of setting the bufferlets to maximum possible)
      Note:

      NFMPORT, NSCNBF, NBBFLT-- refer to I32RDH.DOC page 31 and 48.
      NPORT: # of ports
      NDEVM: # of devices
      NBILIN: # of bisync lines
      MINBUF: approx min # of buffers required per EDF MSG, set to HEX 10
      BUFLO: danger level for buffer free list, set to decimal 15.

      We all welcomed the NSR Database System, when it was introduced last
   March.  However, we soon realized there were some limitations which we
   could not live with.  One of these limitations was that only one user could
   make inquiries at a time.  That limitation is now history.  I have put
   together a program to circumvent this downfall.  All you need is access to
   the CCTS system via a logon ID and a password.  An initial procedure needs
   to be followed, but after that, a simple command will invoke the NSR system.
   The instructions follow:

   1)  Log on to the CTTS system:
          Please log in:  CTTSnnn^R^D;pw
          (nnn = your assigned id number; pw = the assigned password)

   2)  Copy the executive program (EXEC) to your system by doing the following
          LINK NSRRPT 191 199 RR NSRRPT
          ACC 199 G
          COPY NSRLINK EXEC G = = A
          REL G(DET
       (you only need to do this once.  Access to the NSR system will be
       limited to the following command:)

   3)  Invoke the NSR system:
          NSRLINK

      From this point on, you are in the NSR system.  Please contact me if you
   have any questions.  Happy NSRing!

      A word of caution. . .There are some limitations involved with using the
Concord 224 Autodial modems in conjunction with the current async outdial 
service.  Since the Concord 224 does not "wake up" until it receives dtr along
with a carriage return, the Tymcom will have to be set for psig(ifup).  This 
configuration ignores modem signals for all purposes for connection and 
disconnection.  It is preferrable to use the pcan(sig) option, but since the 
modem needs signals from the Tymcom first, this is impossible.  What will 
inevitably occur is a user landing on a port that has either no modem attached
or a defective modem or a loose cable and the call will stay connected.  
The user will have a hung session.

      Dave Peters, in Tymnet Marketing, is currently working with Concord to
reslove this issue.

      The following table indicates the memory requirements of an SNA 
   interface running either version 1.03 or 1.04 with different device
   configurations:


       TOTAL NO. OF DEVICES

      General Guidelines:

        - Printer and CRT require the same amount of memory.

        - Although only 1.04 provides printer support, memory requirements
          for both 1.03 and 1.04 are very close.

        - The overhead of an SNA interface is about 135 K-byte and each
          device needs about 6 to 6.2 K-byte of memory.
      
        - At this point in time, no more than 96 devices are recommanded
          on each SNA interface.


      We will keep you all informed when further information on this subject
   is available.

               (The following note is in response to questions
               that have been asked since we recommended that all
               X.25/X.75 interfaces include the OUCH patch.)

      What does the OUCH patch do?

      The OUCH (OUt of CHannels) patch changes the method of determining the
   number of active ports in an interface.

      The original code incremented and decremented a counter when Ports were
   activated and cleared.  The OUCH patch uses a bit array to keep track of 
   the ports in use.  This array has a bit set for each port when it is in use
   and reset when it is cleared.  The OUCH patch counts the number of bits set
   to one and reports that number.

      The number of HOST PORTS AVAILABLE, the number of available channels and
   the HOST COST depend on this count of ports in use, and thus cannot always
   be relied upon for correct reports.  For example: at times the PORT counter
   method can not keep up with the real activity, and gives false reports, 
   causing an OUT OF CHANNELS message even though there are no users on the 
   line.  The HOST COST and HOST PORT AVAILABILITY algorithms are also 
   affected.

      We want you to avoid problems and suggest that if you do not already
   have the OUCH patch in your command file, that you use 

                              (HQXCOM)OUCHWK.301

   found on systems 25,54,70 or 33; OR USE (BETATEST)XCOM03.P01, instead of 
   the SOURCE patch file.

      If you are already using the OUCH.301 or OUCH.202 patch and do not have
   the HILCN packet option in your tymfile, there is no need to change.  The 
   OUCHWK.301 patch merely allows the inclusion of the HILCN option, but does
   not require it.

      If you have any more questions please contact Mary Lou Harline, ONTYME 
   NSS.M/HARLINE or phone (408) 942-5208.

                 PROCEDURE FOR ESCALATING A SUPERVISOR CRASH
                 -------------------------------------------
                 -------------------------------------------

      When the Supervisor crashes it saves the register values at the time of
   crash in the location CRSAVE and saves the data area at the time of the 
   crash in the crash save area on the disc. It then initializes. Part of the
   initalization process consists of writing zeroes on a major portion of the
   data area.   
     
      When taking a Supervisor dump perform the following steps: 
     
   1) Freeze the Supervisor.
     
   2) Log into NAD and set  up the proper Supervisor nib  
      file - the file that is running in the machine.
      Example:    
     
           %f   nibfile  
           %g  
           lo super 
     
   3) Build a circuit through NAD to the Supervisor slot. 
     
   4) Load the Crash data area from disc by doing    
     
           :ldsav1,savdsz/4,0 
     
   5) You may read out the contents of the registers by   
     
           :m1,crsave,crsave+48    
           :x1,4,2  
     
   6) Put the Supervisor machine in bootstrap.  
     
   7) Take the Supervisor memory dump using LOADII. Refer 
      to the MERLIN output for absolute beginning and
      ending addresses for the Supervisor slot and to page
      62 of tools and utilities document for dumping 
      procedure.  
     
   8) After taking the dump start up the system by   
      pushing the INI button on the console. The Sup 
      should come up sleeping.   
     
   9) Send in the standard escalation form. Include all   
      the information regarding the location of all the   
      files (including dump and log with merlin output). 
     
   10)It is also important to send the information about  
      how to access the private network - probe, xray and 
      ddt. This information should be only sent seperately
      to the person supporting the Supervisor - in the form    
      of ontyme or through telephone. The CC should include    
      his telephone number so that he can be reached.

   As the name  implies,  TMCS is a Monitoring and Control SYSTEM that must
   interact with  a  Network Event Monitor system for complete and accurate
   reporting of a networks' status.  Therefore a TMCS installation involves
   generating  and  installing code for two products, TMCS and NEM.  That's
   not  all,  both TMCS and NEM have seperate programs that must be used to
   maintain  the  disk  file  structures.  In  order  to  properly allocate 
   resources there are two seperate resource  estimator  programs that must
   be run.

   To  TMCS  installation  actually  requires  two  products, which in turn
   require  their  own  disk  maintainance and resource estimator programs.
   Installation will require the following steps:

       1.  Run TMRE to determine necessary resource allocations
       2.  Generate TMCS slot code 
       3.  Generate TMDM disk maintainance code
       4.  Load and execute TMDM
       5.  Load TMCS slot
       6.  Run NMRE for memory estimate and disk partitioning
       7.  Generate NMDM disk maintainance code 
       8.  Generate NEM slot code 
       9.  Load and execute NMDM 
      10.  Load NEM slot

   Once  the  software  is installed it is necessary to define  the network
   configuration  to  TMCS.   Network  configuration  assignments  must  be 
   defined accurately in order for TMCS properly report network conditions.  
   This is  done thru TMCS's Network Configuration Management command.  The 
   data managed by these commands can be divided into 5 groups:

       1.  Cluster Data
       2.  Host Location Data
       3.  Host Names Data
       4.  Node Names Data
       5.  XOM Host Data


   COMMON MISTAKES / PROBLEMS 

   .  TMCS will not recognize a node that has not been named, therefore that 
   node will not be reported.

   .  The TMCS display will report hosts missing if a host is assigned to a
   node that does not exist or if the host location is assigned to the wrong
   node or if the node has not been named.

   In  order  to  see  the node name and host location in the  TMCS  DISPLAY 
   command the following commands must be performed:

     SET NODE NAME
       syntax:   SET NODEs NAME nnnn name
       function: assign a name to node nnnn, as a means of tracking that
                 node more easily

     SET HOST LOCATION
       syntax:   SET HOST LOCATION {host#} {node#} [position]
       function: assign host locations used in the host missing list


   CONFIGURATION PARAMETER DEFINITIONS
   -----------------------------------

   Three parameter groups: 

        1.  NETWORK
        2.  TMCS
        3.  NEM

   NETWORK PARAMETERS ( .A FILE )

     Specify charateristics of the network to be monitored and MUST be
     properly defined for TMCS/NEM to operate properly and efficiently.
     They  play  a major  part  in determining the disk and core usage 
     requirements.

   TMCS PARAMETERS ( .A FILE )
  
     Defines the Concurrent Pascal Preprocessor configuration flags and
     parameters specific to TMCS.
         
     COMMON PITFALLS AND MISTAKES
                
       1.  Misspelling of  $ENABLE  or the  switch name  will produce 
           errors in CPPRO (v10.00 on)
               
       2.  Rule of thumb for most parameter text strings:
    
           String MUST end with a backslash "\" and have an EVEN number
           characters INCLUDING the "\"
              
       3.  Node_Mask and Host_Mask MUST be a POWER OF 2
           (ie. 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, ...)
          
       4.  Node_Hash_Max & Host_Hash_Max  MUST be specified as a PRIME #
 
              
   NEM PARAMETERS ( .A FILE )

     Defines the configuration parameters that relate specifically to NEM
     and are necessary in determining disk and core usage.  They MUST be
     defined in the .A file for NEM.
      
     COMMON PITFALLS AND MISTAKES
           
       1.  The sup login string (ERLOG_TEXT) may have a max of 24 character
           between '  '

           NOTE:  the (:4:) counts as only one character

       2.  The Consumer_Max MUST be set to:

               1 > USER_MAX set for TMCS  
            or 2 > USER_MAX set for TMCS  with RELOAD ENABLEDD


   TYMFILE PARAMETERS (.T FILE)
   ----------------------------

     Configuration parameters from both ISIS and the PASCAL program are
     defined for the PASCAL Nucleus via the slot .T file.



   COMMAND FILE REMINDERS
   ----------------------

   TMCS
 
     1.  Check for Version # changes *** DON'T FORGET PNUC VERSION # ***
         
     2.  V10.00 and > MUST contain Concurrent Pascal Preprocessor
         
     3.  Important when upgrading versions of TMCS: verify patch file
         references are correct for new version.  Assembling in old  
         patches can cause numerous problems.
             
   TMDM
     
     1.  PCOM will hang because the COPY command line is too long.
         To get around this you can:

           1.  split COPY into two COPY command lines,  OR
           2.  run (UPL)COM instead 


   ESTIMATING RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS
   --------------------------------

     TMRE v1.01 (for TMCS v7.05/7.08) output:
    
       1.  TOTAL NUMBER OF CYLINDERS needed by TMCS slot

           ****  Value from TMRE is decimal and MUST be  ****
           ****  converted to HEX for use in DSC file.   ****

       2.  Max number of nodes in a btree file -  btree_max parameter
       3.  MINIMUM MEMORY required for TMCS slot

           ****  ADD  10%  to memory estimate  ****

     TMRE v2.00 (for TMCS v10.00) output:
  
       1-2  Same output as v1.01 EXCEPT:

       3.  TMRE no longer gives estimates MINIMUM MEMORY requirements.  A
           formula will be available with the release documents to determine
           memory usage.


  
  
   GENERATION REQUIREMENTS

   This category describes additional actions need for TMCS and NEM
   to function.

   GUIDLINES FOR SYSTEM UPGRADES
   -----------------------------

     Upgrading the network monitoring tools is done according to the system
     are that is changing (i.e.; source code, disk file structure, TYM file,
     etc.).  



   I.  Upgrading TMCS from Version 7.5 or 7.8 to Version 10.0 or 10.01
       ===============================================================

     Procedure:

       1.  Archive the data base
       2.  Gen and load TMDM Version 1.03 and enter "RECONFIGURE" to
           reconfigure the data base to be compatible with TMCS Version 10.0
           or 10.01
       3.  Gen and load TMCS Version 10.0 or 10.01

     Notes:

       o  If TMDM is interrupted while in the process of reconfiguring,
          the data base will most likely be destroyed; hence the importance 
          archiving the original data base.
   
      o  Because of a memory space limitation in the TMDM Version 1.03 code, 
         it is not possible to reconfigure a data base with this version of 
         TMDM once it has been configured to be compatible with Version 10.0 
         or 10.01

   II  Upgrading TMCS from Version 10.0 or 10.01 to Version 10.10
       ==========================================================

       1.  Archive the data base
       2.  Gen and load TMDM Version 2.0 and enter "RECONFIGURE" to
           reconfigure the data base to be compatible with TMCS Version 10.10
       3.  Gen and load TMCS Version 10.10

   III Upgrading TMCS from Version 7.5 or 7.8 to Version 10.10
       =======================================================
       1.  Archive the data base
       2.  Gen and load TMDM Version 1.03 and enter "RECONFIGURE" to
           reconfigure the data base to be compatible with TMCS Version 10.0
           or 10.01
       3.  Gen and load TMDM Version 2.0 and enter "RECONFIGURE" to
           reconfigure the data base to be compatible with TMCS Version 10.10
       4.  Gen and load TMCS Version 10.10
   


   TMCS COLOR TERMINAL CONTROL SEQUENCES

   As you are probably aware TMCS is capable of emulating different types
   of terminal/monitors.  Those currently supported are:
   
              BLACK/WHITE          COLOR
               o  ADM1              o  ISC2400
               o  ADM3              o  ISC8900
               o  HP2621
               o  SCANSET
               o  DEC VT100

   The following is a description of the control sequences used by the
   ISC2400 & ISC8900 color terminal.  This includes the special sequences
   for color LOG and DISPLAY output.
    

   The cursor function is listed with the decimal value equivalent.  The
   decimal value requires an ASCII character set equivalent.  The symbols
   are as follows:
   
         +     Specifies to concantenate the characters together, unless
               bounded by parentheses or angle brackets.  If  bounded by
               parenthesis or angle brackets add the numeric values.

         =     Specifies the literal equal sign.
       
        ( )    Specifies the  value  of  the  expression  is  a  single
               numeric character and should be translated as such.  For 
               example, if the value of the  expression  is  (14+1), it
               is translated into the ASCII equivalent of 15.

        < >    Specifies each numeric character needs to be translated. 
               For  example,  if  the  expression  is  <14+1>,  it  is 
               translated   into   the   ASCII   equivalent  of  the 
               characters 1 and 5.

ASYNC TO 3270 PRINTER SUPPORT--
 
    There are 4 ways to do 3287 printer emulation with Async to
    3270 Service:
 
            Local Terminal       IBM Host         IBM Host
          Controls Printing  Controls Printing Controls Printing
          (aux pt. attached) (aux pt. attached)(seperate circuit
                                                  attached)

           |                |                  |                |
OPTION 1   |     X          |                  |                |
           |________________|__________________|________________|

OPTION 4   |                |                  |           X    |
           |________________|__________________|________________|
 
****NOTE:  OPTIONS 2, AND 3 REQUIRE UNIQUE NETWORK USER
           NAMES FOR EACH PAIR OF CRT AND PRINTER.  OPTION 4
           REQUIRES  A UNIQUE NETWORK USER NAME FOR EVERY
           PRINTER. IF YOU DO NOT DO THIS THE IBM HOST WILL HAVE
           NO WAY OF KNOWING WHAT PRINTER BELONGS TO WHAT CRT
           USER.  THE END RESULT IS THAT END USERS GET
           MISDIRECTED PRINT JOBS
 
 
    OPTION 1.  LOCAL SCREEN COPY VIA AUXILIARY (AUX) PORT
        ATTACHED PRINTER
 
        the printer is attached to the aux port of the CRT or PC
        and only screen prints are required.  Many IBM
        applications only require this kind of printing.  This
        type of printing does NOT INVOLVE ANY TYMNET TECHNOLOGY
        and your customer should be cautioned to select terminal
        equipment that can do a print of the screen if this is
        what they want to use.
 
      Advantage:
        -reduces Kchar charges because no print data is sent
         across the network.
 
      Disadvantage:
        -no host initiated copy
        -not supported by all terminal types
 
 
    OPTION 2.  LOCAL SCREEN COPY AND HOST INITIATED PRINTING VIA
        AUXILIARY (AUX) PORT ATTACHED PRINTER ( 1Q86 available
        for BSC HIF , SNA/SDLC HIF LU3 or 3270 datastream
        only,beta test)
 
        allows an async, ASCII printer to be attached to the
        auxiliary port of a terminal or PC that has a
        controlable aux port.  Print jobs initiated by the host
        software can be sent to the printer which will appear to
        the host  as 3287 printer .  Async to 3270 Service will
        take care of routing the print job to the aux port of
        terminals and PC packages that can support this feature.
        Check the Ontyme file *** list.asymcto3270 for the list
        of terminals and PC software that supports host initiated
        print and check the manufactures documentation to see if
        the terminal or PC can do the local screen print.
 
        Advantages:
        -dial-up users can get a 3287 print job over a single
         connection
        -local copy is supported on terminals that have this
         feature
        -some PC's can gather the host print on the disk for
         printing off-line which improves operator efficiency
 
        Disadvantage:
        -CRT cannot be used while receiving a print because of
         the technical limitations of the terminal equipment
         available on the market today
        -CMT and HIF devices must be dedicated to each unique
         network user name that identifies a particular CRT and
         printer pair
 
    OPTION 3.  HOST INITIATED PRINTING VIA AUXILIARY (AUX) PORT
    ATTACHED PRINTER ( 1Q86 available for  BSC HIF , SNA/SDLC HIF
    LU3 or 3270 datastream only, beta test)
 
        This is the same as Option 2 except it is for terminals
        without local screen copy capability.  It allows an
        async, ASCII printer to be attached to the auxiliary port
        of a terminal or PC that has a controlable aux port.
        Print jobs initiated by the host software can be sent to
        the printer which will appear to the host as a 3287
        printer.  Async to 3270 Service will take care of routing
        the print job to the aux port of terminals and PC
        packages that can support this feature. Check the Ontyme
        file *** list.asyncto3270 for the list of terminals and
        PC software that supports host initiated print.
 
        Advantages:
        -dial-up users can get a 3287 print job over a single
         connection
        -some PC's can gather the host print on the disk for
         printing off-line which improves operator efficiency
 
        Disadvantage:
        -CRT cannot be used while receiving a print because of
         the technical limitations of the terminal equipment
         available on the market today
        -no local screen print available
 
        -CMT and HIF devices must be dedicated to each unique
         network user name that identifies a particular CRT and
         printer pair
 
    OPTION 4.  HOST INITIATED PRINTING ONLY VIA A SEPARATE
        CIRCUIT    (BSC HIF only)
 
        allows an async, ASCII printer to be shared among a group
        of terminal users.  The printer is connected by:
          1.  connecting the printer to an async terminal
              concentrator that supports PVC's
                                   OR
          2. the printer has a keyboard that is used to do the
             network logon and establish the circuit OR
          3. you can use a PAP (dial-up or leased) with a PVC
 
 
       Advantage:
        -allows any verified terminal to have 3287 printer
         emulation
        -allows colocated CRT's and PC'c to share the same
         printer; therby, reducing costs and improving efficiency
 
       Disadvantage:
        -no local copy function
        -you may pay for connect time for the printer
        -a device address must be dedicated to each printer on
         the BSC HIF
 
 
 
    NOTE:  There are many inexpensive printers available.  It is
usually desirable to chose a printer that has XON/XOFF flow
control and a serial port. Check the hardware manual for the
terminal to find the characteristics of its aux port and make
sure it is compatible with the printer--be particularly careful
about flow control, e.g., XON/XOFF (the best) or hardware
handshakeing CTS.  The IBM PC may be used with a parrall port
and printer.
 
        ALL PRINTERS MUST SUPPORT Carriage Return, Line Feed and
Form Feed and have sufficient columns for the application
 
WCC bit setting supported
    Alarm generates a Ascii Bell
    80 character line
    132 character line
    non-display
 
3287 Printer Orders supported
 
New Line tranlates to Ascii Line Feed and Carriage Return `0A0D'
 
Form Feed translates to Ascii Form Feed `0C'
 
Carriage Return translates Ascii Line Feed and Carriage Return
`0A0D'
 
End of Message will cause the CRT aux port to be turned off if
the printer is attached to the CRT's aux port

      TEST RESULTS TAKEN FROM THROUGHPUT TESTER READINGS OF TYMCOM 2.03
      -----------------------------------------------------------------
      -----------------------------------------------------------------


Written by : Bryan Wing
      Date : Jan 27, 1986




   The following tables reflect results from many tests taken from throughput
   tester readings of Tymcom performance.  These results represent the best
   cases of closed environment tests.  Output totals declined rapidly once
   these values were attained.  No buffer zap messages were elicitted although
   I suspect data was lost.

   The intent of the tests was to find the peak output.  To do this, it was
   necessary to start at a low output and gradually increase the output level.
   Starting the throughput tester output at a high level, such as 240 cps,
   always produced horrible results.  Other readings showed identical results
   for a certain range of ports.  This leads me to distrust the throughput
   tester's readings to a degree.


   High speed interrupts were enabled and only slots (1) and (2) were 
   utilized.  Tymcom code ran in slot (1) and throughput tester code ran in 
   slot (2).  No synchronous input or output was involved except for channel
   (0) network communication.




   This first table represents the best, and I must repeat best, readings for
   (4) ports with throughput tester output set at 480 cps.


   CPS RATES:       INPUT       OUTPUT       COMBINED
       TOTAL:        1598         1416           3014
     AVERAGE:         399          354            753


   This second table represents the best results for (8) ports with throughput
   tester output set at 240 cps.


   CPS RATES:       INPUT       OUTPUT       COMBINED
       TOTAL:        2168         1928           4096
     AVERAGE:         271          241            512


   This third table represents the best results for (16) ports with throughput
   tester output set at 120 cps.

   CPS RATES:       INPUT       OUTPUT       COMBINED
    TOTAL:        2048         1617           3665
  AVERAGE:         128          101            229


   I must emphasize that these figures are very optomistic.  I have seen
   instances where throughput has been degraded with fewer async ports active
   and high speed interrupts are enabled.  Buffer zaps will occur especially
   with high input levels.  In extreme cases, I would not count out a crash
   of the slot.  This is as definitive an answer that is available at this 
   time.  This is for Tymcom code only.  Consat code performs much worse.
   No degradation readings are available for compilation.


  

   I have attached, below, the throughput statistics (by Dave Smith) for
   version 2.00 & 2.01:


               ASYNC TYMCOM VERSION 2.00 THROUGHPUT STATISTICS
               -----------------------------------------------
               -----------------------------------------------


   Many of you have asked for publishable throughput statistics for the 
   Version 2.00 Async Tymcom slot.  The following statistics have been 
   released by NTD, and can be found in the document (BASELINE:39,25,70)
   ACOM02.Y01.  

   The tests were done first for Version 2.00 in foreground, then for Version
   2.01 in background.  The data flow originated at a throughput host slot,
   residing in te same node as the Async Tymcom slot, acting as 15 user
   terminals.  The conclusion is that data in this direction can be compared
   to data originating at the host.  Because the throughput host resided in 
   the same node, bandwidth considerations were not necessary.  The CPU
   utilized by the throughput host could be compared to the node code CPU use,
   if necessary.

   The data was specified as burst size 10, cps 120.  This meant the data was
   received at the Tymcom slot in 10 character messages at an approximate rate
   equal to a 1200 baud terminal.

   Note:  the ideal, non-degraded throughput would be 1800 CPS for one 
   direction, 3600 bi-directional.  The formula:  
              
                       15 ports X 120 CPS =  1800 CPS


   Interrupt Type                        Total Slot CPS

   I. What is Menu Service ?

       A Tymnet software product that provides a very friendly menu screen,
       allows users easy access to a variety of hosts and network services.

       The key words are : friendly menu screen
                           easy access
                           variety of hosts and network services.

   II. The Advantages of Using Menu Service

       - Friendly Menu Screen
         It is 100% configurable. Customers have choices of having broadcast
         messages or not, one menu or multiple menus, what to display on 
         screen, what to use for selection fields.

       - Easy Access
         One login sequence versus multiple login sequences, eliminate keying
         errors.

       - Variety of Hosts and Network Services
         This includes Tymnet or outside information vendors. Customers can
         store all kinds of services in one place.

       - Other Good Features
         * Multiple Logical Slots (16 per physical slot)
           Allows customers to set up multiple levels of user accessing.
         * Inactivity Timer
           Saves connect charges if service is not in use.
         * AutoLogin/AutoLogoff
           Special application when customers choose not to have screen 
           displays.
         * Password Option
           Depends on the application, customers can choose to have users key
           in passwords or to have passwords kept in the Sysgen file (of cause
           we can use Cipher to achieve the security protection).
         * Project Code Collecting
           Very good feature for costs/expenses distributing.


   III. Things to Watch Out For

       - Password Option
         This is not for keeping unauthorized users out from accessing to the
         Menu slot. This is to give the customers the flexibility of what to
         do with the passwords.

       - No Way Out
         This is the most critical issue. Users do not have a good way to
         interrupt circuit building, cases like incorrect selections or
         unsuccessful logins. The only way to get out of the waiting would
         be "put the terminal offline".
         Bug report has been sent to NTD. So far, it's not resolved yet.

       - Screen Echo Problem
         Put CMT and Menu Service together, sometimes it will cause some 
         characters not being displayed. HQTECH is working together with NTD
         on this problem. At this stage, we don't know the cause of the 
         problem yet.
   
       - Sup Timeout When Using Manual Login Problem
         Manual Login is one of the nice features in Menu Service. But
         if the user does not send in login sequence in time, the Sup timeout
         sometimes will cause slot to be halted. This is a known problem
         to NTD and us.

   IV. Marketing Information
   
       Menu Service is in Limited Release phase right now. So far, we have
       6 customers in PublicNet. There are several PrivateNet customers
       show great interests in it as we were told. But they would probably
       prefer to make the decision when it's in full release. The general 
       concern from the sales is we don't have a External Reference Spec. 
       Marketing is working on this issue.

  SECTION 1.0 Overview
  --------------------
  The NETVAL program is used to validate TYMNET network users  and  to
  determine  how much access a user has within a network.  NETVAL runs
  in a slot in the Internally Switched Interface System  (ISIS)  on  a
  TYMNET node.

  SECTION 2.0 Concept
  -------------------
  The CUD, or Controlling User Directory, is a file which contains  an
  entry for each valid user in the network.  When changes are made via
  NETVAL, they are made directly to CUD file a record of  each  change
  also appended to the MUDUPDATE file.

  The MUD, or Master User Directory.  Each supervisor in  the  network
  has its own copy of the CUD on its own disk, reffered to as the MUD.

  In order for the supervisors to be accessing up-to-date data, NETVAL
  uses the information in the MUDUPDATE file to notify each Supervisor
  of all the CUD changes.  There is  an  automatic  process  for  each
  supervisor of the change.

  SECTION 2.1 CUD MUD Contents
  ----------------------------
  USERNAME : Up to 20 characters.  The acceptable  characters  consist
             of:
      1.  all alph-numeric characters.
      2.  the characters: <space>   $  *  , .  - /
  ENTRY CHANGE DATE PASSWORD CIPHER : Up to 30 characters any character
      other than a semicolon, null, rub-out, escape, or carriage return
      may be useed.  
  PASSWORD  CHANGEDATE 
  UNIVERSAL  USER  NAME (UUN) : 0 - 37777777777 (octal).  
  GLOBAL ACCOUNT NUMBER (GAN) - optional : Group user together under a
      single account.   range  0  - 37777777777.  
  CONTROL OPTIONS :
      AUDITOR OPERATOR 
      ACCOUNT SUPERVISOR
      NETWORK SUPERVISOR
      IGNORE HOST 
      NO PASSWORD
      SHUT OVERRIDE
      TRANSPARENT LOGIN
      DISTRICT  - optional 
  HOME : A default termination point for a  circuit  if no termination
         host is included in the login string or if the user  has  the
         ignore host option. 
  HOST : A host number is an address antity in  the network from which
         a  circuit  can  be  built.
  ACCESS PROFILE
      ORIGIN : Class.
      DESTINATION : Group.




  SECTION 3.0 Supervisor updating
  -------------------------------
  Netval is a Network Validation program  that  allows  validators  to
  make  changes  to  network validation data on the Netval system, and
  automatically transmits these changes to network Supervisors.  These
  data that is handled by Netval includes:

  1. CUD/MUD Information:
     When a user attempts to login through the network, the Supervisor
     uses the  information  in  its  MUD to determine the user's legal
     access.
     * Is the user name in MUD?
     * Is the passwords correct?
     * Can  user  originate  from the node or host that he is entering
       the network from?
     * Can user access the host specified as a destination?
     * Which  host  should  the user  be  routed  to  if there is none
       specified in the login string? etc.

  2. Class/group information
  Part of the user's CUD/MUD entry contains access information,  i.e.,
  legal network origins and destination for users.

  CLASS : is a  globally  defined  set  of  originating  hosts  and/or
  originating nodes, which are used to define the locations from which
  a user may access the network (ORIGINS).   GROUP  :  is  a  globally
  defined  set  of host numbers.  Groups are used to define the set of
  host to which a user may build a circuit.  (DESTINATION).

  Netval maintains information about Classes and groups, and generates
  a  copy  of  supervisor  Class/group Table; each supervisor uses its
  Class/ Group Table when a user is logging  in,  and  the  users  MUD
  entry refers to a CLASS an origin or a GROUP as a destination.

  In both above cases, validators login to Netval and make changes  to
  Netval  information.   Netval  then  transmits  the  changes  to the
  supervisors.

  When transmitting CUD data, Netval communicates with the  UN2  slave
  part  of  the supervisor; When transmitting Class/Group data, Netval
  communicates with the SYSMSG1 Slave part of the Supervisor.

  It is important that the validation information gets updated on  the
  Supervisors  in  a timely manner.  Out-of-date information may cause
  users to lose access through the network, or may grant access  to  a
  user that should no longer have it.  

  Netval maintains a list of "legal" supervisors, the supervisors that
  have  been  turned  "on"  in Netval with the SET SUPERVISOR Command.
  There are the supervisors that Netval will  update  when  there  are
  changes made to CUD or Class/Group Table.
    



  READ TABLE  comman  allows  the  validator  to display a Class/Group
  table.
  If the  optional  argument <sup> is included, the supervisor's table
  will  be read  and  displayed.  if the argument is omitted, NETVAL's 
  table will be displayed.

  SECTION 3.1 MUD Updating
  ------------------------
  When a modification is made to the Netval CUD, a description of  the
  change  is appended to the MUDUPDATE file.  An automatic process for
  each supervisor is notified that there is a change  to  be  sent,  a
  circuit  is  built  to  Supervisor,  and  the  change is transmitted
  through the network.  Only the changed information is sent.
  Network keeps track of how much data is in the file (the  file  EOF)
  and  the  point to which each Supervisor has been updated.  When the
  data has been sent to all legal supervisors, the EOF is set to 0.
  If a supervisor is "Down" (inaccessible to Netval) for a  period  of
  times  the  data  in the MUDUPDATE file may come close to filling up
  the file.  If the MUDUPDATE file ever becomes full, VALIDATORS  WILL
  NO  LONGER  BE ABLE TO MAKE CHANGES TO THE CUD.  A supervisor may be
  turned "off" with the SET SUPERVISOR s OFF command.

  CONSISTENCY :
     * SET SCHEDULE  Command, once a day a consistency process is run.
     * RUN_AUTO_CONSISTENCY_ON_SUP_INIT  parameter  set to true in the
       config  file, a consistency  will  start  up  immediately  when
       the SET SUPERVISOR  command is executed. 
     * Manual  consistency  is  run  whenever  there  is a doubt as to
       whether the MUD contains up-to-date information.

       It compares  checksums  between  CUD and MUD blocks, and if the
       MUD checksum does  not  match  the  CUD checksum, the CUD block 
       data is to be stored in the MUD.



  SECTION 3.2 Class/group Table Updating
  --------------------------------------
  The  Class/Group  Table  information  is   maintained   by   Network
  Administrator validators.  When the class/group Table is ready to be
  transmitted to the supervisors the SEND command is executed.
  This causes a date (class/group table last created) to be set to the
  current  time.   An automatic process continually compares this time
  against the time that the table was last sent  to  each  Supervisor,
  and  if  necessary, transmits a copy of the Table to any out-of-date
  Supervisors.

  SECTION 4.0 Operator Log
  ------------------------
  Netval maintains a log of information about critical events  in  the
  Netval system, This includes validator logins, logouts, disk errors,
  and  the  execution   of   critical   operational   commands(Setting
  Supervisors,    consistency,   schedule,   etc.).    If   the   flag
  CHANGE_TO_OPERLOG is enabled in the Netval configuration  file.  The
  MESSAGE command is used to display information from the operator log
  file.


  SECTION 5.0 Logical Volumes
  ---------------------------
  In NETVAL version 3, if the configuration  parameter LOGICAL_VOLUMES
  is  Enabled in the Netval configuration file, the engine must have 2
  physical disk drives.  An ISIS  logical  unit  is  defined  on  each
  physical disk drives for the CUD and file system.  The "CUD" logical
  units include the CUD and the CUD parameter file; the "file  system"
  logical units include all other Netval files.

  SECTION 5.1 Logical Volume Commands
  -----------------------------------
  COPY : The COPY commands causes data to be read  from  one  physical
  disk  (in  read/write  state)  and copies to the same sectors on the
  other physical disk (in the down or offline state).  Once  the  copy
  operation  starts,  the state of the disk being copied TO is changed
  to write only.  At the end of COPY command, the state  of  the  disk
  being copied TO is changed to read/write state.

  If  neither  disk  is  down  or offline, the user receives the error
  message:
       one disk must be down or offline
  IF a copy is already being performed  on  the  system, user receives
  message:
       A copy is already in progress

  If the above  criteria  are  satisfied,  the  COPY  Command  display
  Logical  volume  information,  and  prompts  for confirmation of the
  direction of the copy.

  DISPLAY LVOL: It will display current  logical  volume  information.
  It can be used to monitor the current drive states.

  SET Drive d OFFLine : It will set the specified drive,  "d"  to  the
  offline  state;  it  should  be  used by an operator when a drive is
  known to be faulty, the data on a disk is suspect, or when preparing
  to remove a pack from the system.

  SECTION 7.0 NETVAL Disk Maintenance Program (NVDM)
  --------------------------------------------------
  NETVAL Disk Maintenance Program (NVDM) is used  to  perform  certain
  NETVAL  disk and tape operations.  The NVDM program runs in the same
  ISIS slot as NETVAL, but not at the same time.

  NVDM is used to initialize  or  reformat  the  NETVAL  disk  and  to
  reconfigure  files.   NVDM  is also used to display information from
  the NETVAL disk.

  NVDM has its own archive subsystem, which is used  to  perform  tape
  operations.   The  NVDM  user  can use the NVDM archive subsystem to
  restore files from tape to disk.  All tape files can be restored  in
  one  operation.   Some specific files such as the CUD file, can also
  be restored.

  Only the NETVAL user at highest authorization level and a  specially
  designed NVDM operator validator are authorized to use NVDM.

       Current fully relesed versions of RAM are RAM  version  10.05  and
       RAM  version  10.07.   Current  Betatest  versions  of RAM are RAM
       version 11.04 and RAM version 11.05.  

       Problems that  may  be  encountered  in  the  operation  of  these
       versions are:

         o  For Versions other than 11.05, RAM goes haywire if all slaves
            are declared down and RAM is allowed to RUN.

         o  RAM may at times have a communication problem with the slaves
            which  is  often  corrected by issuing a SLAVE/UP command for
            the slave in question.

         o  RAM may need to be  restarted  due  to  a  crash,  change  of
            version,  or  necessity  for disk or tape maintenance.  It is
            best to  restaret  RAM  with  a  WARMSTART  command  whenever
            possible.  If a new version of RAM is loaded or the data from
            the last RAM backup no longer resides on  the  RAM  disk,  it
            will  be  necessary  to  follow  the  COLDSTART  procedure as
            outlined in the RAM Operator Guide.  If  the  crash  occurred
            while  RAM  was in the RUN state, it is likely that RAM would
            have stopped in the middle of a  file  and  consequently  the
            tape  would not have been ended with two tape marks.  If this
            should happen and RAM does not require  a  COLDSTART,  it  is
            best  to  use  the  ATTACH/BACK  and  WARMSTART  commands  to
            reposition the tape at the point of the last backup  and  RAM
            will  continue  processing from the point of the last backup.
            The ATTACH/BACK command has a bug in version 10.05.

         o  Use of the SETBLOCK command without issueing a  COLDSTART  in
            conjunction  with  the  SETBLOCK command can cause incomplete
            sessions to be written to tape.  This  could  happen  if  RAM
            were  instructed  to recollect previously collected SUP data.
            The COLDSTART command clears the  table  RAM  uses  to  track
            session records.

         o  If RAM generates a tape that is unreadable, there could be  a
            problem  in  recreating  the  tape.   Version  11.05 has tape
            duplication capabilities as long as the tape has been  backed
            up  to  disk.   An option exists in version 11.05 to backup a
            specified number of tape images to  disk.   It  is  virtually
            impossible  to  recollect  RAM  data and expect to produce an
            exact image of a previous tape.  A set of tapes collected  on
            one  drive  and  a  second  set of tapes collected on another
            drive can produce two  sets  containing  complete  accounting
            data  if  the  procedure  is  followed as outlined in the RAM
            Operators Guide.  The procedure requires that the  collection
            process  for  each tape begin with a COLDSTART and end with a
            DRAIN.  The  DRAIN  writes  out  incomplete  session  records
            remaining in memory.

         o  If a second tape unit is attached and on-line when the  first
            unit  fails,  RAM  will write to the tape on the second unit.
            However the labeling information for the second tape will  be
            the same as that for the first tape.

         o  RAM's normal collection process may be interrupted  following
            a  DUMP  command  if  the  RAM pointer is not reset.  (May be
            reset by the SETBLOCK command)

         o  The RAM session pool will fill up frequently  if  not  enough
            memory  is  allocated  for  the  expected load of the Network
            involved.

         o  Testing RAM with continual logons will  produce  an  abnormal
            number of sessions and cause the session pool to fill.

         o  RAM may report that the disk is down if  the  wrong  type  of
            disk  controller  is  specified  in  the  slot tymfile or not
            enough space was allocated for a disk backup in the DSC file.

         o  If only one supervisor is reported on the status report  with
            possibly  the  wrong  number, it could be that a count of the
            number of  supervisors  was  given  in  the  SUPERS  paramter
            instead of each supervisors number.

         o  Garbage such as host numbers and passwords  may  show  up  in
            RAM's  project code field depending on how interfaces such as
            the TYMCOM are set up to report this  data.   This  might  be
            avoided  by  regenning  the interface not to report a project
            code or have the interface specify  to  the  ISIS  delimiters
            such  as  a  carriage  return or ";" in receiving the project
            code.

         o  The report generated by the STATUS command will  not  reflect
            the  results  of  the  SETBLOCK  command  until after the RUN
            command is executed.

     Version 3.01 of the XCOM code allows for much larger systems
     than previous versions.  BIGIO is intended to help with BIG
     systems, but it isn't needed until you get REALLY BIG systems.
     
     Baseline Document XCOM03.Z01 states (Section B.3, page 2):
        "Switch BIGIO will effect the memory requirements of
        the interface.  When ON more memory will be required.
        An assembly time warning message will indicate when it
        must be turned ON."

     What happens if your system is TOO BIG?
     At the start of assembly of XCOM03.R01, a WARNING message will
     appear:

        "Configuration too large -- reduce either number of links, 
        MAXPSIZE, or MAXK, or use 2[BIGIO in CMD file."

     What is TOO BIG?
     It is not possible to make a general statement because of the
     variety of parameters, but the following configuration was genned
     without assembly errors, and WITHOUT 2[BIGIO:.
          512 DPORTS
          4 HOSTS
          10 LINKS (10 had packet size 512, packet window size 127,
                    2 had large frame size - MAXK(127)).

     Because of the large number of DPORTS, P0SIZE had to be increased
     to 1000 (this was also true with 255 DPORTS).  
     The final size was 664d K-bytes of core.

     You will probably not need to worry about getting a 2[BIGIO 
     message for your usual systems, but watch for PATCH0 area 
     overflow with lots of DPORTS.

     DO NOT use 2[BIGIO unless you are told to--and even then consider
     reducing one of the three sensitive parameters:  number of links,
     MAXPSIZE, or MAXK.

                   DOCUMENTS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE

     COMMENT ON THE HELPFUL DOCUMENTS ON THE BASELINE DIRECTORY:
     Baseline Software Release Form XCOM03.X01, Software Release
     Description XCOM03.Y01, and Document Change Description 
     XCOM03.Z01, all mention supporting documentation on System 39.

     These will soon be available on another system.  Don't
     give up if you don't have access to System 39.

   IBM ABNORNAL DISCONNECT/SECURITY ISSUE
 
   IBM host application programs have no standardized  method of
   accepting an "abnormal disconnect" sequence and closing end users
   sessions. The open session issue exists any time you introduce
   "switching" into an IBM data communications environment.  This
   includes not only Tymnet and other VAN's but also IBM's own SNA
   Network Interconnect products. Tymnet's IBM Host Interfaces have
   the capability to notify the IBM host to close its session.
   Tymnet has been working with our customers and outside software
   vendors to find workable solutions to close host sessions and
   "clean up" data queues.

   THE ISSUE

   The possibility of one end user getting into another end users
   open IBM host session and/or one end user getting data that was
   meant for another end user.     
 
   Example 1 : User 1 does not log out of their CICS session but
   unplugs the modem instead.  Tymnet will cancel the circuit and
   may send a "notification" to the IBM host.  It is the CICS on the
   IBM host that is responsible for understanding the "notification"
   and closing the end users session.

   Example 2: User 1 does not log out of their IMS session but
   unplugs the modem instead.  Tymnet will cancel the circuit and
   may send a "notification" to the IBM host.  It would then be up
   to IMS application program to cleanup user 1's data que's.
   Instead IMS is designed to hold that data until that LU logs on
   again.  Since Tymnet "shares" LU's among multiple end users user
   1's data will end up in someone else hands.  This is considered
   an unacceptable security violation by many customers.
 
   Example 3 :  User 1 disconnects abnormally.  Tymnet sends nothing
   or something that the IBM host can not interpret as "close the LU
   session".  The next end user will get into the open host session
   and will have bypassed any host security logons and/or passwords.

   CONCLUSION

   Tymnet has worked closing with our customers to find solutions
   for these issues.  The following are technical discussions that
   describe how various Tymnet customer have implemented successful
   systems with various IBM host applications.

   The setting of the disconnect sequence must be done VERY
   CAREFULLY by someone who is intimately familiar with IBM link
   level protocols.  The improper setting of a disconnect could
   cause undesirable reactions from a host system.
 



   CICS--Abnormal Disconnect
 
   Bisync systems running CICS version 1.6 and lower.
 
   Most CICS systems will close a session upon an abnormal
   disconnect if they are sent a Sense and Status message.
   Tymnet's Bisync Host Interface version 7.05 has a patch avialable
   from HQTech that will send any Sense/Status code that the
   customer needs. The customers CICS systems programmer should
   check the CICS Terminal error program, Terminal control program
   and/or Node abnormal condition program to determine what
   Sense/Status code should be used at their installation.
 
   NOTE:  DETERMINING THE CORRECT SENSE/STATUS IS THE CUSOMTERS
   REPONSIBILITY.  TRYING TO GUESS CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS IN BISYNC
   SYSTEMS. WHILE THE MOST COMMONLY FOUND SENSE/STATUS IS `C240'
   OR`D240', CICS SYSTEM TABLES MUST BE CHECKED BY THE CUSTOMERS
   SYSTEMS PROGRAMER TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF THE SENSE/STATUS
   SELECTED.  THE SENSE/STATUS SHOULD ONLY CLOSE A SINGLE SESSION
   AND NOT BE SET TO DISCONNECT OTHER USERS OR BRING DOWN THE ENTIRE
   CICS APPLICATION.

   Other technical concerns:

       1. CICS Terminal Control Table--if users can not log on after
       an abnormal disconnect the customers CICS programmer needs to
       check the RELREQ parameter.  If it is not there or is 
       RELREQ=(no,no), which is the IBM default, you have found a
       problem.  The table must be regened with the second
       parameter set to yes.
 
       RELREQ=(no,yes) or RELREQ=(yes,yes) or RELREQ=(,yes)
    
       2.  The VTAM exit LOSTERM may also effect the
       processing of the disconnect sequence. LOSTERM is the VTAM
       exit responsible for interpret and processing the
       sense/status to the host application.

   If problems still exist RFI *** BSC

   SNA/SDLC CICS Systems
 
   When the host interface get the Zapper it will send a SNA/SDLC
   Terminate-Self command to the IBM host.  Although the TERM-SELF
   is not documented as a valid 3270 command it does work.  If a
   customer is still having problems have the customers systems
   programmer check:
 
 
       1. If users can not log on after an abnormal disconnect the
       customers CICS programmer needs to check the RELREQ parameter
       of the CICS TCT table.  If it is not there or is
       RELREQ=(no,no), which is the IBM default, you have found a
       problem.  The table must be regened with the second parameter
       set to yes.
 
       RELREQ=(no,yes) or RELREQ=(yes,yes)  or RELREQ=(,yes)  are
       the recommended parameters.

       2.  VTAM Logmode table--most systems use an "orderly
       termination" ;however, some may need "forced termination".
       In this case, byte 3 bit 2 of the TERM-SELF will need to be
       adjusted.

                        immediately and unconditionaly
                 1 orderly termination--permitting an end-of-session
                        procedure to be executed at the PLU before
                        the session is deavtivated (this is the
                        default)

       3.  If the problem still exists RFI *** SNA for further
       assistance.
 
 
 
 
   TSO--Abnormal Disconnect
 
   Bisync systems running TSO 
 
   Most TSO systems will close a session upon an abnormal disconnect
   if they are sent a Sense/Status message. Tymnet's Bisync Host
   Interface version 7.05 has a patch avialable from HQTech that
   will send any Sense/Status code that the customer needs. The
   customers TSO systems programmer should check the TSO system
   tables to determine the proper code.

 
   Note:  The most commonly found default is `C240' but have
   customer check to be sure.

   Other technical concerns:

       1.  The VTAM paramenter LOSTERM may also effect the
       processing of the disconnect sequence.

 
       2.  If problems still exist RFI *** BSC

       2.  If the problem still exists RFI *** SNA for further
       assistance.
 
 
 
 
   VM--Abnormal disconnect
 
   Bisync systems running VM 
 
   Most VM systems will close a session upon an abnormal
   disconnect if they are sent a Sense and Status message.
   if they are sent a Sense/Status message. Tymnet's Bisync Host

       2.  If the problem still exists RFI *** SNA for further
       assistance.
 
 
 
 
   IMS--Abnormal Disconnect
 
   IMS is the most difficult of all the IBM applications to get
   cleaned up.  This is becuase IMS is designed to keep data in its
   queues even upon system failure--the least of which is a terminal
   abnormally disconnnecting from a session.   While Tymnet's IBM
   Bisync Host Interface has the flexibility to send various
   "disconnect indicators " to the IBM host it still remains the
   responsibility of the customer to have IBM host software that
   will dequeue data intended for the disconnected  session.
 
   Some Tymnet customer's have written their own VTAM
   resident "session manager" software to perform this function.
   This software recognizes a message or status or test request
   sequence from the BSC HIF which indicates a network disconnect
   has taken place.  The SNA/SDLC HIF uses the TERM-SELF as the
   network "disconnect indicator". The software then cleans up any
   data left for the disconnected session. 

   At the present time, we are working with several software
   vendors and testing several packages that  perform the "clean-up"
   function.
 
   Another option to consider is to use static network addressing
   (CRM2).
 
   If you have a client who is using IMS you should get in touch
   with Product Marketing to get the latest information on software
   packages.

      IT HAS BEEN DISCOVERED, THAT AN UNDOCUMENTED AJ4048 DESIGN CAN ADVERSLEY
   AFFECT THE OPERATION/QUALITY OF THIS DIAL-UP SERVICE.  A 70 MILLI-SECOND
   LOSS OF CARRIER OR GAIN HIT AND RESULTANT WAIT PERIOD FOR A LOOP BACK OR
   DIAGNOSTIC COMMAND WILL DISCONNECT THE LINE.  IN THE DIAL-UP, VOICE QUALITY
   ENVIRONMENT, WE WILL EXPERIENCE CARRIER LOSSES OF THIS DURATION AND THE
   LINE WILL DROP AS THE APPROPRIATE REMOTE COMMAND DID NOT FOLLOW THE 70 
   MILLI-SECOND OPEN.

      AT THIS TIME, WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED A MODIFIED P.R.O.M. TO THREE 
   CUSTOMER SITES.  THIS P.R.O.M. DEFEATS THE 70 MIL-SECOND WAIT PERIOD AND
   WILL ALLOW AN OPEN OF UP TO 10 SECONDS BEFORE THE LINE WILL DROP.  ALL 
   THREE APPLICATIONS WERE EXPERIENCING 3-8 LINE DROPS PER DAY.  WITH THE 
   INSTALLATION OF THE MODIFIED P.R.O.M.S THERE HAVE BEEN ZERO DROPS IN THE
   PAST 2-3 WEEKS.

      A.J.'S ENGINEERING GROUP IS LOOKING AT THE 70 MILLI-SECOND PERIOD TO 5
   SECONDS AND RETAINING THE REMOTE LOOP BACK/DIAGNOSTIC CAPABILITY. 
   OBVIOUSLY, WE WOULD LIKE TO RETAIN THESE CAPABILITIES BUT, WILL FOREGO 
   THESE FEATURES IN FAVOR OF RESOLVING THE DICONNECT ISSUE IF IT IS NOT
   POSSIBLE.

      WE WILL BE UPGRADING ALL AJ MODEMS WITH THE NEW P.R.O.M.S AND REQUEST 
   YOU NOTIFY NTS IF YOU REQUIRE AN EXPEDITE ON AN UPGRADE.  A.C.F.B. WILL BE
   GENERATED WHICH WILL COVER ALL ASPECTS OF THE UPGRADE.

      I have been asked to outline for you the backup procedures currently
   in place at the data centers to better help you plan how and when you
   should specifically ask to have .NIB files backed to tape.  

   These procedures are consistent for all systems/all data centers:

   1)  Once a day a tape is generated for each system.  This captures
       all files created that day, and all updates to old files.
       These tapes are kept for one month.  (E.G., each system has
       a set of 31 tapes; one for each day of the month.  As the
       new month begins, tapes from the beginning of the previous
       month are over-written).

   2)  Every other week a procedure called 'ALLFILES' is done which
       copies every file on the system.  These tapes are kept for
       6 months.


      If you do not specifically request to have a file (or files) stored
   to tape be sure that its contents was at least captured by the daily
   tape backup before you delete it (i.e., keep it online 24-hours ).

      When requesting a file restoration, request that the file be restored
   from the ALLFILES tape which covered the date (or range of dates) in
   question.

                              POLICY ON PATCHES        
                              -----------------

Written by : Mike Cady, Director of Marketing
      Date : January 27, 1986




      A primary responsibility of both Technical Services and Network 
   Technology Development is to resolve software anomalies.  One of the 
   methods used to resolve an ananomaly includes the generation of a temporary
   patch.  As Technical Services does not have responsibility for either 
   source code or maintenance programming, the major decisions relating to the
   methodology of a cure lies with the Network Technology Division (NTD).  As
   a result, a close working relationship with NTD is required. This memo 
   attempts to set out the policy by which Technical Services and NTD will
   deal with the broad issue of patches.
 
      While Technical Services may be able to write a patch for a specific 
   customer need, their major responsibility is to ensure that NTD incorpor-
   ates the change not only in the version which demonstrates the problem/
   need, but all future product release.
 
      Software patches can be divided into two categories.  Those required to
   resolve an anomaly in the software and those required to implement a 
   feature not in the software.
 
   
      I. Patches created as the result of a software anomaly are    
         considered as a necessary element of the Field and 
         Technical Services function.  The following procedures 
         apply:
 

         A. All patches will undergo as much testing as possible 
            prior to installation in a network interface.
 
         B. All patches generated by the Field or Technical Services 
            must be delivered to NTD via the NSR process as an 
            anomaly report.
 
         C. Technical Services will support and maintain all patches 
            in an "ALPHA PATCH FILE" directory until NTD issues a 
            new PATCH FILE release.
 
         D. NTD will incorporate the fix in the next release of 
            source software whenever timing allows.
 
         E. NTD reserves the right to reject an NSR or Escalation 
            of a problem with an accompaning patch which has not 
            been approved by NTD when NTD suspects the ananomaly 
            is associated with the patch.
 

     II. Feature required as the result of a Field/customer request 
         must be submitted to Technical Services for review and are 
         not to be installed into a network interface without the 
         explicit consent of Technical Services.  The following 
         procedures apply:
                  

         A. All requests for features submitted to Technical 
            Services will be submitted to NTD and Product Marketing 
            via the PIR process.
 
         B. All feature patches generated by the Field or Technical 
            Services will be supported and maintained by Technical 
            Services in the ALPHA PATCH FILE directory until NTD 
            accepts or rejects the PIR.  Technical Services will, if 
            possible,  obtain PIR approval from NTD prior  to 
            installing a feature patch into a network interface.
 
         C. All feature patches installed into a network interface 
            which do not have NTD approval will require a letter 
            from Sales to the customer informing them of the special 
            nature of the patch and its possible removal in the 
            event of the PIR's rejection.
 
         D. All feature patches must be tested in a lab environment, 
            if at all possible, prior to installation.
 
         E. Upon acceptance of the PIR NTD will evaluate the 
            request and implement the feature in the next possible
            release of source software, as dictated by its priority
            as set by the JPPC.  NTD may reject an associated patch
            that it feels is not technically sound.  NTD's primary
            commitment is the implementation of features into the 
            source code, not via patches.

         F. PIR's and feature patches rejected by NTD will be 
            escalated to the Vice Presidents of Marketing and NTD 
            for resolution.  In the event that the PIR is found 
            unacceptable the customer will be notified via a letter 
            from Sales representative and the feature patch will be 
            de-installed.

     PROBE Log message:

     "NODE REPORT 2021 FROM SLOT 2 XCOM TYPE 1 10100" is defined in Steven 
     Wong's book, "A Presentation of CCITT Series X Recommendations and 
     Tymnet", pages 16.1-16.2 as:

     Interface Crash Sup Report with Crash Count 01, Crash Code 01 and 00
     as undefined.

     This is the normal state after starting up--Crash Code 01 is for manual
     start.  You should see it only after loading the code.

     This book also lists another Message Type that is not listed in the
     PROBE manual:  Type 0 - BUFFER ZAP SUP REPORT.  This report is made 
     whenever a Buffer Zap occurs.  (During the regular reporting routine, 
     Message Type 18 will be sent since the total number of buffer zaps has 
     changed since the last report to the Supervisor.

     The format for this Type 0 message is:

          NODE REPORT nnnn FROM SLOT m XCOM TYPE 0 aabbbb
          where aa = total number of 1 K characters deleted
                     i.e. 05 = 5000 characters deleted
                bbbb = buffer number zapped

     The messages listed in the PROBE manual (pages 73-80) give the value in
     an error cell  and are reported on a timer basis if the value in the 
     error cell has changed since the last report.  Message type 0 and message
     type 1 are reported as the event occurs.

      Good News!! The technical problems holding up the use of Concord Modems
   and Microsoft's Access with X.PC/CMT have been resolved.


   Microsoft's ACCESS
   ------------------

      If you have the Access software and have sent in your registration card
   to Microsoft they will be sending you information about upgrading to 
   Version 1.1.  This version (1.1) of Access has the latest version of X.PC.
   The new version is REQUIRED to operate X.PC/CMT correctly.  The previous 
   version of Access (1.0) will have problems with local echo mode of CMT.  If
   you have Access and have not returned your registration card to Microsoft 
   you should do or call Microsoft at (206) 828-8080 for information on ACCESS
   upgrades.


   Concord Modems
   --------------

      The Concord X.PC modems are O.K. if you received them after mid-December
   1985.  If you want to test before you do a live demo log in to the 3270 
   demo system via X.PC.  Use the Order Entry Screen (Option 4) and make sure
   you get into local echo mode within 2-3 seconds.  If it takes longer you 
   have a modem that needs upgrading.  You should contact your Concord rep to
   get modem updated.

      Remember, the X.PC Network Server is in Beta so using X.PC Network 
   Server by our customers still requires beta test approval.  You can make 
   your request via Ontyme by executing ":EXEC *** FORMS.XPCBETA."

      The X.PC Driver in the Concord modems and in the Microsoft's ACCESS is 
   in full release.  The products have been verified by HQ Quality Assurance.

      Happy Selling Async-to-3270 Service.  Now with complete end-to-end error
   correction via inexpensive async connections through X.PC!

                   DEDICATED ASYNC OUTDIAL  -  RELEASE II
                   --------------------------------------

      We are looking for a few good beta test customers to test Dedicated
   Outdial - Release II.

   The primary new features of Release II  are:

     1) Indial/Outdial  - the same port can be used for either indial or
        outdial on a demand basis.  For example, customers can use this 
        capability to implement security-call-back (i.e., end-users would 
        dialup Tymnet, login to the customers host in the usual way, identify
        themselves to the host by entering some username/password id, and then
        hang up.  The host would then initiate an outdial call back to the end
        -user, using the same indial/outdial port(s), to make sure they are 
        who they claim to be.   This application, of course, requires that 
        customers develop the call-back software on their host.)

     2) 2400 bps, as well as 1200 bps and 300 bps, async support for both 
        indial and outdial.

     3) Autobaud.  The Tymnet outdial port will automatically adjust to the
        speed of the device (modem) being outdialed to, and to the speed of   
        devices (modems) indialing to it.

     4) Dynamic option selection.  Parameters such as XON/XOFF, half duplex, 
        and parity can be set for each session at the beginning of the session

     5) Local echo.  Outdial calls originated by X.25 hosts support local 
        echoing at the Consat/Outdial interface.  (Consat originated outdial 
        calls, though, will not support local echoing at either end.)



      We are looking for 4 or 5 customers to begin testing in late March and 
   April.  The beta test should last approximately three months.

   To submit a request, send me an Ontyme (NSMS.G/Smith) with the following
   info:

   1. Business case.  What is the business (money) opportunity involved?

   2. Suitability as a beta site.  Will they be a productive test site?  Do 
      they have the necessary technical expertise and commitment?

   3. Application.  What are they going to use outdial for?

   4. Customer equipment.  What kinds of devices do they plan to use, e.g.,
      modems, host interface, printers, PCs, CRTs, etc.

   5. When will they be ready to start testing?




   KEY THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW

   * Dedicated Outdial - Release II uses the new Consat/Outdial code developed
     for Publicly Shared Outdial which will be released later this year.  This 
     future service will allow customers to share outdial ports and be billed
     for their use of the ports on a usage sensitive basis.  Customers who are
     interested in using Public Outdial will clearly benefit from the experi-
     ence they gain with Dedicated Outdial - Release II.  Their efforts will 
     also help us to deploy Public Outdial sooner.

   * Dedicated Outdial - Release II uses a new command language.  Preliminary
     user documentation will be available in early March.  The old "Asynch-
     ronous Outdial User's Guide" is for the old Dedicated Outdial service 
     only.

   * The new Consat/Outdial code will undergo a month of internal QA tests 
     at HQ QA and NTS before the customer beta tests begin.

   * Beta Test Pricing.  For the beta test period, AOS-H1 monthly and install-
     ation charges will be waived.  All other charges will be applied, e.g., 
     kchars, host interface, account charge, outdial phone call charges.

   * Please do not submit an order before your request has been approved.  The
     order will just be put on  hold and you will have very disagreeable 
     people to deal with.

   * Once the request is accepted, customers will need to sign the Beta Test
     Agreement.


      If you have further questions, please Ontyme (NSMS.G/Smith) or call
   (x5214).

      As you are probably know, Tymnet customers that wish to access the
   U.S. from Alaska can do so through Alascom.  Alascom has been expanding its
   access locations (see below for updated list).  One IMPORTANT consideration
   you should know when informing your customers about these new location: the
   log in procedure is different from Tymnet in many cases.
 
      *  Login procedure for non-stat mux sites is the same as Tymnet
 
      *  Login procedure for stat mux sites (SM sites) is the following:
 
         1. Dial the Alascom number
         2. User will see 3 to 5 lines of "?"
         3. User should type two carriage returns and the terminal identifier.
            This should be done while the question marks are being printed.
            Alascom will continue to send the "?" until the 3 to 5 lines of
            "?" are printed.
         4. Alascom will prompt the user with a PLI.

     TMCS Initialization
     ===================

     Load TMDM nib file (file.ni#) into TMCS slot first.
     After the slot is loaded, log into the slot host with 
     username:host#;pswd<cr>, the screen displays:
     > 
     TMCS Disk Maintenance Program - Version 1.03 at mm/dd/yy time
     *  
     Please enter INITialize for disk initialization.
     "disk initialization succeeded."  would be displayed if there 
     is no problem on disk.
     Use "Quit" to log off from the slot.

     Then load TMCS nib file (file.n0#) into the slot.  
     After the slot is loaded, log into the slot host with
     username:host#;pswd<cr> to get into TMCS, then use
     username MASTER pswd MASTER for the second login.
     Once log into TMCS slot successfully, first set up Probe
     circuit to each sup by using
     * SET PROBE sup#
     TMCS will prompt pswd, enter NETPAT's pswd.  If the
     pswd is not corrected, the Probe circuit will not be
     set.  
     After this, user can update TMCS database for user
     profile, node name, host name, host location, etc.


     NEM Initialization
     ==================

     Load NMDM nib file (file.ni#) into NME slot first.
     After the slot is loaded, log into the slot by using
     NETEVOP username (host# and pswd depends on how validation
     has been set up for NETEVOP).  The screen will displays:
     version #.## - date
     Enter command or "H" for help:
     For disk initialization, enter I, it will prompt
     Enter "A" for all sups, or last sup digit:  A (user enters)
     The "A" command will destroy all data on the disk,
     Do you want to continue?  Y (user enters)

     There is no log off command for NMDM, the slot will be
     replaced by loading NEM nib file (file.n0#) into it.
     After the slot is loaded, log into Probe to check
     whether the NEM host is up.  If it's up, then the
     loading is succeeded.  To try it works or not, log into
     TMCS using DISPLAY command.  


     Note:  When loading TMCS and NEM at the same time, both slots
     cannot be up due to synchronous problem.  For better result,
     load NEM slot first, after the slot is up, then load TMCS slot.

               HOW TO APPEND SYMBOL TABLE TO A SLOT DUMP FILE
               ----------------------------------------------
               ----------------------------------------------


Written by : Dianna Tai/DeeJong Tsao, HQ Network Staff Consultant    
      Date : February 26, 1986




      We have come across several occasions when the symbol tables were not
   appended to the dump files, or if it was appended, it was useless due to
   errors in the process.  Some probable errors might be:

 
   1. Error occurred in one of the following steps:
 
      a. Named the dump file with the nib file name. 
      b. Appended wrong nib file to the dump file; for example, appended
         SNA nib file to 3270 HIF dump.
      c. Used a new dump file name (different from the dump file name
         created via LOADII) while appending the dump to the nib file.
 
   2. The slot crashes; NSSC takes the dump and then notifies the CC.  

      This results in a complicated situation in which the dump file and nib
      file reside on different systems/different directories.  Now, the
      TELECOPY program is used to copy one file from a particular directory
      and system, onto another.  

      If difficulty encountered, cc may leave this task to Technical Servces

 
      Following, are examples of steps you would use in taking a slot dump 
   and appending the symbol table correctly:  (note: lower case letters are 
   system prompts) 
 
   Step 1. Run LOADII to take a slot dump (only input the related prompts
           which are displayed here) 
 
           -R LOADII 
           enter function:U
           enter kernel host number:666
           circuit built
           enter slot number:2
           enter file for slot:NDXXX.DMP
           ....
           ....
           slot dump complete
           exit
 
   (Now you have created a file called NDXXX.DMP, which is a dump file
   from slot #2, on kernel host 666).
 
   Step 2. Check to see if the nib file is on the same directory and same 
           system.  Let's assume dump file NDXXX.DMP is in (NSSC:26), and 
           nib file ND1234.N02 exists on (TYMNET:54).  You decide to put
           them both on (TYMNET:54) and use TELECOPY to copy the dump file
           to (TYMNET:54) where the nib file is located.
 
           a. log on to (NSSC:26) with your license set
           b. -COPY NDXXX.DMP,(TYMNET)NDXXX.DMP
           c. -R TELECOPY
              :(TYMNET:26)NDXXX.DMP,(TYMNET:54)NDXXX.DMP
           d. -DEL (TYMNET)NDXXX.DMP
 
      (TYMNET:26) is used as a transitional station to get around TELECOPY
      limitations, as it only copies files from same directory to different
      system.  Thus, it is necessary to delete NDXXX.DMP from (TYMNET:26) 
      after the file is copied successfully.)
 
   Step 3. Now, you can append the symbol table by logging on to (TYMNET:54),
           where you have both files ready.
 
           -R NAD
           %F    ND1234.N02      (note, the spaces are given by NAD)
           %G
           1%F    NDXXX.DMP
           %P%Q
           -
 
           (This NDXXX.DMP now should have symbol table appended)
 
 
   Step 4. To verify if the symbol table is appended and you have a valid
           dump, examine the dump file:
 
           -R NAD
           %F    NDXXX.DMP
           %G
           (case A: here if you get "Module not in file", then symbol
                    table is not appended)
           ;G
           (you will get segments range display)
           8%2
           PRODID#
           (case B: if get "Undefined not allowed?", then dump got messed-up
                    somewhere)
           (case C: if it is a 3270 HIF dump, and you got a number other than
                    34 from the system, then the nib file must be from 
                    another slot / another product)
           CRAT,4C[
           (case D: IF this is a crash dump, but crash table contains 0's,
                    then you did not catch the crash information.)
         
      When any of these cases (A,B,C or D) are encountered, the dump file is
   not valid and will not be useful for analysis.

      Lately, there has been some confusion regarding the charging for 
   CMT/3270 services, when CMT and 3270HIF slots are running in different 
   nodes.  This memo serves to clarify the issue.  

      Currently there are two ways in which Tymnet charges for CMT/3270HIF 
   services.  The details are listed below :

   1) CMT/3270 service charged by one session ---
      This applies to the following 2 network configurations :
      a) CMT and 3270 residing in the same node, or
      b) CMT and 3270 slots residing in the same site but on different nodes.

   Either of the above configurations generates one invoice number for the
   session between CONSAT and CMT, and it is the only session charged by
   TYMNET.

   2) CMT/3270 service charged by two sessions ---
      If CMT and 3270 slots are seperated at different sites and nodes, then
      two invoice numbers are produced: one for the session between CONSAT
      and CMT, and the other one for the session between CMT and 3270HIF. 
      In this case, both sessions are charged by TYMNET.

           Security Implications of Gateway Access Procedures 	  
           --------------------------------------------------
           --------------------------------------------------


Written by :   Stephen White, External Network Services
      Date :   February, 1986



   Here follows a discussion of some alternative procedures by which
   Tymnet may be accessed from 'foreign' networks.  Emphasis is given to
   the security offered by Tymnet's advanced implementation of X.121
   addressing.
 
   For the purposes of this discussion a 'foreign' network is any
   network other than Tymnet and includes not only other country's
   networks but also other networks in the United States of America.
   Network security from gateways is increasingly important as Tymnet
   brings up X.75 service with the Bell Operating Companies:  over 160
   such gateways are already planned.  Tracing 'hacker' calls back
   through gateways is time-consuming and often fruitless.  
 
   A host may elect to be open to calls worldwide or to restrict access
   by requiring a username and/or password to be given to Tymnet before
   the call is routed to their host.  Tymnet addressing also allows for
   an address to be priority and/or multi-targeted to a group of hosts.
   The wide range of options available enable a host to tailor its
   access procedures to satisfy its requirements for security and ease
   of access.
 
   Tymnet's security is at its weakest at the x.75 gateways where we
   have to conform to the CCITT standards used by networks worldwide.
   The spirit of the CCITT standards x.121 and x.75 is that, as with the
   telephone, if you know a number you may call it.  For hosts that wish
   this we provide group 19 (see below).  Tymnet is unique in the level
   of security it can provide through enhanced features like those
   outlined below.  In these matters prevention is definitely better
   than cure, we urge careful reading of this document so that
   a full appreciation of the implications of each alternative may be
   gained....do you know that, by default, domestic usernames can
   be used to log in from foreign nets?...read on!
 
 
 
 
   OPEN GATEWAY ACCESS - Group 19 
   ------------------------------

   Hosts which wish to be addressable from any foreign network with
   Tymnet connections and with minimal network security applied may
   request (preferably as a written request) to be in group 19.
 
   A host in group 19 is presumed to have security checks performed by
   the host operating system.  Group 19 host addresses are available to
   foreign administrations so a host that does not wish its address to
   be so widely available should request to be red-listed (un-published).
 
 
 
 
TYMNET - ExNet Tech Spt                                Page - 02
 
A group 19 host is addressable as....(note the zero after the 3106)..
 
3106+0+<host>+<spid>   where:  3106    = Tymnet's Data Network Identification
                                         code (DNIC) allocated to Tymnet by
                                         the U.S. State Department.
                                 0     = 'identifier' digit.
                               <host>  = a 5 digit host number.
                               <spid>  = up to a 4 digit sub-addr (optional).
 
Example: 3106000127  would address host 127, with no sub-host.

----------                              ---------------------
Easy Access - no password to enter.     Address may become known to
                                        non-legitimate users, 'hackers'.
 
Wide range of sub-hosts addresses.
 
Worldwide access.                       Access cannot be limited from 
                                        particular countries.
 
                                        no priority/multi targetting
                                        capability.
 
 
 
ALTERNATIVES TO GROUP 19
------------------------
   To take advantage of Tymnet's security checking capabilities on calls
   from other networks a host needs one of the alternatives to group 19
   for its access procedures.  Using one (or more) of the options below,
   with password protection, a very effective initial screening of calls
   is carried out by the network supervisor.  Note that for a host
   migrating from group 19 it is not necessary to change the host
   number, moreover the X.121 address that is sent to the host may not
   need to be changed.
 
 
   Suppose host 0127 wishes to be removed from group 19, or set up for
   restricted gateway access:  the options are...
 
OPTION (A) - Using a Network User Number (NUN) with password protection.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Send a request to ENS.DTE for a numeric username as an NUN to form
   the x.121 address.  We recommend that a password and red-listing
   (address un-published) be requested though these items are optional.
   Addresses in this format are of the form...(note the 9 after the
   DNIC)...
 
3106+9+<host>+<spid>   where:  3106   = Tymnet's DNIC
                                 9    = 'identifier' digit
                              <host>  = a 5 digit hostnumber
                              <spid>  = up to 4 digits of sub-addr (optional).
 
   Example:  For host 127, sub-host 00...
             310690012700    (NUN=90012700)
             310690012700    (NUN=90012700)
 
 
Note:  If a password  is required  then the Tymnet supervisor will prompt
       for the password before the circuit is built to the host.  With the
       address being a username, a password may be added/changed by the host
       at any time, even if no password was originally requested.  Password
       changes take effect in about 20 minutes - considerably quicker than
       removing the host from group 19 and validating an NUN!
 
Advantages                              Related disadvantages
----------                              ---------------------
Easy for Tymnet to identify host.       Host identifiable to an outsider.
 
Password protection,  managed by        Caller may have to enter a password.
host on Tymnet.
 
Password may be in Call                 Password in CUD is passed to host.
User Data (CUD).                        CUD limited to 12 characters.
 
Easy for hosts to originate calls.      Easy to guess/search for address -
                                        hence a password is recommended.
 
Multi/Priority targetting.              Sub-host addressing is awkward with
                                        current implementation, a separate
                                        NUN is required for each sub-host.
                                        A version of XCOM code will soon be
                                        available to overcome this limitation.
 
By addressing 31249.... instead of      DNIC 3124 can only be used from those
31069.... access may be limited to      countries served by FTCC.   In the
particular international links.         event of an outage at FTCC, backup 
                                        facilities may be limited and access
                                        temporarily lost from affected links.
                                        Links may serve more than one network.
 
Note:  For X.25  hosts,  be sure   to  coordinate  the  change of called
       address with the  host. If it is difficult for the host to change
       its software to accept a new called address it may be possible to
       perform address modification at the host interface to overcome this.
 
       Example:  for a version 3.01 X.25 host a patch, (bchen:33)caddr.301,
       may be included which will ALWAYS substitute the called
       address in an IIX call for the address specified in the CLDADR
       statement.  Other patches, capable of more elaborate
       manipulation, may be available, contact HQTECH XCOM group or
       ExNet Tech Spt (ENS.ITS) for information.
 
OPTION (B) - Using a Random Network User Number with password protection.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Request  a random NUN  (from  ENS.DTE) for  the x.121 address, ask for it
to be red-listed (un-published) and have a password.
 
 
 
 
Addresses of this format are of form...(note 99 after the DNIC)..
 
3106+99+<####>     where:  3106  = Tymnet's DNIC
                            99   = 'identifier' digits
                          <####> = four to eight (4-8) 'random' digits.
 
Example: For host 127,  31069985326   (NUN=9985326)
 
Note:   If sub-host addressing   is required  then specify in the request
to ENS.DTE exactly  what  the  last   1-4   digits   should  be for every
sub-host.
 
Advantages and disadvantages of option (b)
------------------------------------------

   Same as for option (a) except that with the host number no longer in
   the address, problem diagnosis may be slowed:  the price for being
   cryptic.
 
 
OPTION (C) - The 'user friendly' approach.
------------------------------------------

   From a foreign network, users are able to enter a called address of
   "31069" to direct their call to Tymnet.  The Tymnet supervisor
   prompts them to "please log in:  "  just as on Tymnet.  If a class 1,
   2, 4 or 24 username is entered, the supervisor will allow the call to
   be completed.  By default ALL 'domestic' usernames have class 4
   access and may be used to log in from other networks.
 
   If you wish to control which usernames may be used from foreign
   networks, give 'domestic' usernames only class 35 access and
   'foreign' usernames only class 1 access.  A class 1 username MUST
   originate from an X.75 gateway host whereas a class 35 username is
   EXCLUDED from gateway access.  This provides good security, standard
   'log in' procedures and user friendly network responses.
 
Advantages                              Related disadvantages
----------                              ---------------------
Easy for async/3270 hosts that          More difficult for host 
need to 'key-off' usernames for         to originate calls.
sub-host/application routing.
                                        An X.25 Host recieves a call request
                                        with "31069" as the called address.
                                        This may be rejected by the host
                                        software, so it may be necessary to 
                                        have the host interface modify the
                                        address sent to the host.
User friendly network responses.
 
Username/password combination is
difficult to 'crack'.  Tymnet host
is able to change password for user.
 
Log in procedures are very similar
for both domestic and foreign users.
  
 
CONCLUSION
----------

   A requirement for 'external network' access is by no means synonymous
   with a host needing to be in group 19, with all the attendant
   security implications.  Choosing one of the alternative options, or a
   combination of (c) with (a) or (b), can offer effective protection
   and other benefits.

   document, please contact External Network Services by calling

      The following is the procedure to upgrade from Netval, version 1, to
   Netval, version 2.  (For example, when Netval 1 currently resides in a
   sup node and the upgrade will bring Netval 2 to a non-sup node.)  

      For explanation of Netval commands, refer to Netval 1 and Netval 2
   reference manuals.


   1.  To make sure that all the cud changes after the last scheduled
       consistency are recorded in the muds, run the SUP command in Netval 1.
       It will show the time when the mud is last updated in each supervisor.
       If there is any change after the mud is last updated, do a manual 
       consistency with the CON command.

   2.  Turn off all the scheduled updates to the sups.  Run the SET command in
       Netval 1.  Enter carriage return for valid supervisor and for frequency
       of updates.
  
   3.  Run the TYP ALL, LIST CLASS, LIST GROUP, LIST HOSTLIST and LIST 
       NODELIST commands and get a hardcopy of the output.

   4.  Run the RESET command.

   5.  Run the STORE command to save a copy of the cud, class and group table,
       etc. on tape.

   6.  Halt Netval 1.




   Option A -- This method will only create the cud on the Netval 2 disk after
               the upgrade.  The class, group, hostlist and nodelist have to 
               be typed in.  This method is recommended because it is straight
               forward.


               7.  Load the Disk Maintenance program to Netval 2 slot.  Run
                   the REGENERATE CUD command and then the REGENERATE 
                   PARAMETERS command.  Use ddt ?HIST command to check if 
                   there is any range error in the Netval 2 slot.  If there 
                   is, report to HQTECH.  Otherwise, run the INITIALIZE 
                   CONFIG, INITIALIZE OPERLOG, INITIALIZE MUDUPDATE and 
                   INITIALIZE NODE commands to initialize necessary Netval 2 
                   files.

               8.  Run the CHECK command.  If there is any mismatch parameter,
                   check the files that the parameter is defined or referenced

               9.  Load Netval 2, run the SELECT CONTROL NA command and then
                   the DISPLAY DIRECTORY command.  Get a hardcopy of the 
                   output.  If there is any format or checksum errors, report
                   immediately to HQTECH via ontyme name *** NETVAL, or call 
                   Jeff Liu at (408)942-5264 or call Amy Kwok at (408)942-5248

              10.  Enter the class, group, hostlist and nodelist with the data
                   from step 3.

              11.  Upgrade is completed.  




    Option B -- This method will creat the cud, class, group, hostlist and
                nodelist on the Netval 2 disk after the upgrade.


               7.  Configure and gen Netval 1 to have consistent logical unit
                   in slot tym file with dsc file as Netval 2. Load it into
                   the Netval 2 slot.  Run the RESTORE command. The reason is
                   we have to use Netval 1 to restore the tape created by
                   Netval 1.

               8.  Load the Disk Maintenance program to Netval 2 slot.  Run
                   the CONVERT command to convert the cud from Netval 1 to
                   Netval 2 and run the REGENERATE PARAMETERS command.  Use
                   ddt ?HIST command to check if there is any range error in 
                   the Netval 2 slot.  If there is, reprot to HQTECH.
 
               9.  Run the CHECK command.  If there is any mismatch parameter,
                   check the files that the parameter is defined or referenced.

              10.  Load Netval 2, run the SELECT CONTROL NA command and then
                   the DISPLAY DIRECTORY command.  Get a hardcopy of the 
                   output.  If there is any format or checksum errors, report
                   immediately to HQTECH via ontyme name *** NETVAL, or call 
                   Jeff Liu at (408)942-5264 or call Amy Kwok at (408)942-5248

              11.  Run the DISPLAY CLASS, DISPLAY GROUP, DISPLAY HOSTLIST and
                   DISPLAY NODELIST commands.  Compare with the class, group,
                   host and node lists from step 3.  If there is any mismatch,
                   report to HQTECH.

              12.  Upgrade is completed.

      DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS, ENROLLMENT IN TYMNET TRAINING AND EDUCATION
   COURSES FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 1986, IS NOT AS HIGH AS PROJECTED LAST 
   OCTOBER.  THEREFORE, WE ARE MODIFYING THE SCHEDULE FOR THE SECOND QUARTER.
   THIS MODIFICATION PROVIDES THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:

      A)  CLASS SIZE WILL BE LARGER WHICH MAKES TRAINING MORE EFFICIENT.
      B)  WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO CANCEL CLASSES.
      C)  TTE WILL BE ABLE TO DESIGN AND DELIVER MORE CUSTOMIZED COURSES
          FOR SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS.
 
      THE DISADVANTAGE OF THIS REVISION IS THAT THOSE WHO ARE CURRENTLY 
   ENROLLED IN CLASSES THAT ARE NO LONGER ON THE SCHEDULE WILL HAVE TO CHANGE
   PLANS.  WE REGRET THIS INCONVIENCE AND WILL DO OUR BEST TO RESCHEDULE YOU 
   FOR AN ACCEPTABLE TIME.  CHERYL MCGOWAN, TTE REGISTRAR, WILL CONTACT YOU TO
   RESCHEDULE.
 
   ***  SPECIAL NOTE TO SALES REPS - PLEASE INFORM YOUR CUSTOMERS OF THIS
        REVISIOIN.
 
      THE PRINTED SCHEDULE AVAILABLE FROM SUSAN COPELAND WILL BE CHANGED BUT
   THIS WILL TAKE SEVERAL WEEKS.  MOST CLASSES FOR WHICH CUSTOMERS ARE 
   CURRENTLY REGISTERED WERE NOT CHANGED.  PROPOSALS FOR CUSTOMER-SITE CLASSES
   ARE NOT AFFECTED BY THIS REVISION. ***
 
      TO ENROLL IN THESE CLASSES CONTACT CHERYL MCGOWAN, ONTYME NSS.TTE.  SEE
   THE TTE BROCHURE FOR COURSE DESCRIPTIONS AND FEES OR CALL R.GRANDEY,  
   408/435-0239.

     The class and group table sizes are allocated differently for Supervisors
  of versions 40 and 41.  In version 40.01, the parameters CLSSIZ (class size)
  and GRPSIZ (group size) is allocated in number of bytes.  In version 41.1 
  and above the CLSSIZ and GRPSIZ are allocated in number of sectors in the
  FENCE macro.  For version 40 of your Supervisor you have
     
          CLSSIZ = 280 hex bytes  
          GRPSIZ = 180 hex bytes  
     
  For version 41 of the Supervisor you have,   
     
          FENCE(30,3,10,2)   
     
  i.e.    CLSSIZ = 3 sectors or 300 hex bytes
  and     GRPSIZ = 2 sectors or 200 hex bytes 
     

     NETVAL has CLSSIZ = 280 and GRPSIZ = 180.  When a 'send' command is issued
  in NETVAL, 280+180 or 400 hex bytes would be sent to both the Supervisors. 
  But for the new Supervisor, CLSSIZ+GRPSIZ = 500 and not 400.  This leads to
  the problem of sending class and group tables to version 41 of the 
  Supervisor.  
     
     To send the tables correctly to version 41 of the Supervisor, we have to
  redefine the sizes to NETVAL.  But since we want to transition from version
  40 to 41 on both Supervisors one at a time we have to follow a carefully 
  thought out procedure. 
     

  Here is what I propose for a smooth transition:   

     
  1) Reload Supervisor 2   
  2) Remove sysmsg1 username    
  3) Run consistency  
  4) Manually update CG tables in Sup 2   
  5) Run on Sup 2
     
  If Sup 2 stable then
     
  6) Reload Sup1 and netval with new code making sure not to  
     disturb the mud/cud area.  
  7) Revalidate sysmsg1 username
  8) Swap to Sup 1    
  9) Set to Sup 1 only in netval
  10)Send tables from netval    
  11)Run on Sup 1
     
  If Sup 1 stable then
       
  12)Set to both Supervisors in netval.

   What equipment does the customer have to buy (modems, cables, acu's, and
   related specs)?

      Externally, all you need, is a compatible cable (RS-366/V.25) for an
      801 Dialer and a compatible cable (RS-232/V.24) for a 208 Sync Modem.  
      Internally, you need an outdial cable for each dialer, with 5 async 
      connectors and a single sync port connector.

      The related specs are (Techref:56)ACU.GED - General External Design,
                                        ACU.GEN - Sysgen Manual,
                                        ACU.ERS - User Manual,
                                        ACU.IMS - Internal Maintenance Manual.



   What is the procedure for placing a call?

      ACUS initiates the call.  PVC is built from BBXS to ACUS.  Ontyme builds
      an AUX circuit to ACUS.  PVC keeps track of which port is connected to
      which dialer.  The second Data Circuit goes to BBXS from ACUS, thus data
      flows from ontyme - to ACUS - to BBXS - to 2780/3780 EBCDIC terminal.  
      BBXS runs in virtual mode.  All the translation from ASCII to EBCDIC
      and from EBCDIC to ASCII are done by BBXS.  BBXS generates as a terminal
      interface.



   How many slots are involved and what are they (TIF, HIF, ACU Server, Parent
   outidal, etc)?
      
      There are two slots involved.  In one slot, BBXS code is loaded and in
      the another one, ACUS code.

              QUESTIONS & ANSWERS ON PRINTER OUTPUT FOR CRT/PRT PAIR
              ------------------------------------------------------

   ORIGINAL QUESTION:


      A user is assigned a CRT/Printer pair at logon (wildcard), let's say
   device 40 (CRT) and device C1 (printer), but does not activate his printer
   (does not turn it on. . .).     If he then requests a print-out from the
   host, where will the print-out go..???

   Will it go to the CRT?
   
   Will the host interface know the printer is not active and send a status 
   message to the host, telling the host not to send the print-out?

   Also, if a user is assigned a CRT/Printer pair at logon, as stated above
   (wildcard), does the printer keep the assigned device address (C1), whether
   it is active or not...or does it get assigned a device address only after
   it becomes active?




   RESPONSE:


      Following is a simple drawing of the configuration you described, and a
   description of the circuit building process:
 
     |---|   |----| 40 (CRT)  |----|    |-------|   
     |FEP|-- |HIF |---------- |CMT |--- |CONSAT |-- CRT 
     |---|   |    | C1 (PRT)  |    |    |-------|    |
             |    |---------- |    |                 |
             |----|           |----|                 |--> PRT
 
   step 1: The user logs on with a username of CRT/PRT pair defined in CMT.
   step 2: Since it is a wild card, HIF assigns one CRT and one PRT to this
           user, by allocating from the highest device number available.
   step 3: So there are two distinguished circuits, for the CRT and PRT,
           between the HIF and CMT.
   step 4: Host sends a print job to C1.  CMT receives it from HIF and does
           necessary translation with escape (ESC) sequences so that the
           CRT (or emulation program) understands.
   step 5: When the CRT receives the start print ESC sequence, it routes the 
           message to the printer, and gets back to the CRT mode when it
           receives the end print ESC sequence.
 


   Now to answer your specific questions:
 
   1. Q: Where does the Print-out for a powered-off PRT go?
      A: It could come out on the CRT screen or could be lost, while locking-
         up the CRT keyboard, depending on how the CRT (or emulation program)
         handles it.  Different CRTs have different ways of dealing it.
 
   2. Q: Does the HIF know if the printer is not active?
      A: No, because the CRT does not notify the CONSAT that the printer is 
         not active, So neither the CMT nor the HIF knows it.
 
         However, if it is the CRT that is powered off, then the CONSAT
         detects the DTR is off and will notify CMT and in turn notify the
         HIF.
 
   3. Q: Does the printer get assigned a device address only when it is
         active?
      A: If the user logs on to HIF, with a CRT/PRT pair, then the printer
         gets assigned a device address after the user logs on, no matter if
         it is powered on or not.

              QUESTIONS & ANSWERS REGARDING 'TOM SHUT OVERRIDE'
              -------------------------------------------------
              -------------------------------------------------


Question by : Marcia Hopkins, Field Communications Consultant
Answered by : Peter O'Harrow, HQ Network Consultant
       Date : March, 1986




   Original Question:


      THIS QUESTION PERTAINS TO TOM AND SHUT OVERRIDE CAPABILITIES.  I VALI-
   DATED A TOM USERNAME FOR THE CUSTOMER CALLED TOMLA## AND I GENNED THE NAME
   INTO THE TYMFILE UNDER THE TOMGG LIST.  WHILE TESTING PRIORITY-TARGETED 
   USERNAMES, THE CUSTOMER DISCOVERED SOME "DISCREPANCIES".


   TEST #1 INVOLVED USERNAME TOMLA## LOGGING ON TO HOST 4649 AND SHUTTING THAT
   HOST NUMBER, USING THE SHUT HOST COMMAND.  USER LOGGED BACK INTO 
   TOMLA##:4649 AND GOT "HOST SHUT".  ##TOM##:4649 WAS JUST FINE.

   TEST #2 INVOLVED SHUTTING SORD #1 DOWN WHICH CONTROLS ALL PORTS FOR HOST 
   4649.  LOGGING INTO TOMLA##:4649 WAS SUCCESSFUL.

   TEST #3 INVOLVED SHUTTING PORTS 0-4 WHICH REPORT TO SORD 1-HOST 4649.  
   LOGGING INTO TOMLA## GOT A "HOST SHUT" MESSAGE WHILE ##TOM##:4649 WAS FINE.
   UNDER THE SHUT COMMAND ^ SECTION OF THE REFERENCE MANUAL I SAW THAT SHUT 
   OVERRIDE STATUS HAS NO EFFECT ON SHUT PORTS.  IS THERE SOME DIFFERENCE 
   BETWEEN THE LOGIN "AUTHORITY" OF TOMLA## AND ##TOM##.  IT WAS MY UNDER-
   STANDING THAT SHUT OVERRIDE WAS SHUT OVERRIDE AND THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO 
   DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO USERNAMES.


   Response:


      Shut override status requires special Supervisor validation, and is 
   authorized only for the username "##TOM##".  "TOMLA##" does not, and may 
   not, have shut override status.  The macro "TOMGG" pertains only to level 
   "2" privledge, not to override status.

      Shutting the host through TOM will cause a "host shut" message to be 
   sent to the Supervisor, of course.  Shutting all the async ports for a 
   particular host will also cause a "host shut" message to be sent to the 
   Supe.  Shutting a subhost, even if all async ports are assigned to that 
   subhost, will not cause the "host shut" message to be sent, however.  This
   last situation may seem a little odd, but it allows the customer whose TOM
   username lacks shut override status to shut-off user access while still 
   allowing his own access to the TOM.

Question by : David Auerbach, Field Communications Consultant
  Answer by : Shiao-Ming Tsui, HQ Network Consultant
       Date : March, 1986




   Original Question:


      I am trying to gen version 10.0 and I get an 'invalid string' error,
   from CPAS1, if I have a banner string longer than 20 characters.  I am
   using the same banner that I was running with version 7.8.  The sample TMCS
   parameter file assembles ok (its banner is 20 characters).  If I try adding
   just one more character to it, I get the error there too.  I can find no 
   parameters relating to max string constants.  What is the problem?




   Response:


      The banner title string must end with 'backslash' and must be an even
   number of characters (including the backslash).  There is a maximum of
   80 characters allowed.

      If your customer is using a TTY terminal or emulation going to CMT, 
   please be certain that the 3270 application programs, on the host, sends 
   us all erase write commands (F5).  If you see a screen being displayed 
   several times, that's a good indication that the application is sending 
   write commands (F1) instead of erase write.  Please alert your customer 
   of that.

               A LESSON IN LOGIC - OR HOW TO MAP CONSAT PORTS
               ----------------------------------------------
               ----------------------------------------------


Written by : Michael Hanna, Field Communications Consultant
      Date : March 20, 1986




      The attached article, was originally sent to Tymnet's Field Engineers,
   by Michael Hanna, to try to clear-up any confusion that resulted from the 
   numerous PVC Port installs he has been doing on Isis Consat slots.



      There seems to be a problem understanding the logical, to physical,
   mapping of the isis consats that have PVC code in them, for ADP.  This 
   is not a problem inherent to just ADP`s consats, but with isis consats in 
   general.  

      The confusion seems to arise from the fact that the isis consat slot
   will look at the first port, in any isis consat slot, as port '0' and then
   count up from there.  This means that regardless of the `aref`, used in
   the slot, the first port will be 0, and the second port will be 1, etc.
   even though the actual physical port may be 16, or 32, or 48.  This has 
   been the cause of much confusion in the past and this is my attempt to try
   to clear up some of that confusion.

      If there is a question about where a port is physically located on the 
   async board, then maybe the following chart can help:


   **  if 'aref(0)' is the first 'aref' in the slot, then the physical to 
       logical port mapping will be one-to-one  **


     physical     |                logical isis consat ports
      ports       | with one of the following as the first aref in the slot
                  |
   dec  |  oct    |   aref(0)    |    aref(1)    |   aref(2)     |    aref(3)

      There are some nodes in the net (node 5245 for example) that have an odd
   'aref' configuration (i.e. aref`s 0, 1, 3) which can make for some inter-
   esting times when working on trying to find out what circuit is supposed to
   be on which port.  Although in the above example, with node 5245, the 
   logical port mapping would be ports 0-47 -logically!!

      Hopefully this will clear up any confusion about descrepensies between 
   the slot code, for a consat with pvc code and a project report, that don`t
   seem to match up.

      I have been informed that the above situation is only a factor with an 
   isis consat and that they are the only type of consat -or tymsat- that 
   deals with the logical to physical mapping this way.  A standalone tymsat 
   or consat would have a one to one mapping, physical to logical.

TYMNET INTRODUCES SNA/SDLC SUPPORT FOR ASYNC-TO-3270 SERVICE (PRESS RELEASE)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Written by : Lori Waggener, Network Services & Marketing Support
      Date : March 24, 1986




      ATLANTA, Georgia, March 24, 1986 -- Tymnet, McDonnell Douglas Network
   Systems Company, announced here today at Interface the full release of
   SNA/SDLC support for its Async-to-3270 Service, a significant addition to
   the company's IBM data communications services.

      This service cost-effectively connects asynchronous ASCII terminals and 
   PCs to IBM mainframes without the need for expensive synchronous emulator 
   boards, WATS lines and protocol converters, or host-based conversion 
   software, and provides access to 3270 applications such as TSO, VM, CICS, 
   AND IMS.  Current customers of the service include Teledyne, American 
   President Lines, and DuPont.

      SNS/SDLC is the most popular type of communications protocol in the 
   IBM world.  Customers having IBM mainframes can now have pure SNA networks
   using this service, and can serve even low-to-medium-traffic sites cost-
   effectively -- sites that might otherwise be served by cluster controllers
   and leased lines.  (Previously, Tymnet accomplished async-to-3270 protocol
   conversion by means of bisync interfaces or X.25.)

      Because the Async-to-3270 SNA/SDLC support is designed and built to 
   reside within the TYMNET public packet-switched network, it takes advantage
   of the network's advanced technology and associated benefits including 
   erro-correction, network management, added layer of security, access to 
   hundreds of data bases from a single terminal, extensive local access
   availability, and complete protocol support and conversion capabilities.
   No other company offers a comparable network-resident service.

      "This service can be a substantial cost-saver for small, medium, and 
   large companies needing to connect micros or terminals to IBM mainframes 
   and access 3270 applications -- and especially for those companies with 
   users scattered over large areas, who can take advantage of Tymnet's 
   geographically dispersed local access coverage," said Mary Chalmers, 
   Tymnet's 3270 Product Manager.

      Currently, 82 terminal brands and PC software packages are certified
   as compatible for use with Tymnet's Async-to-3270 Service, including the
   SNA/SDLC version.  File transfer software from Micro Tempus (distributed by
   Pansophic, Innovative Computer Products, Sterling Software's Dylakor 
   Division, and others) is available for use with the service, and incorpor-
   ates the X.PC asynchronous communications protocol for error-free file 
   transmission.

      The Async-to-3270 SNA/SDLC Service was tested rigorously throughout 
   1985, both in beta-test and limited release modes.

      Tymnet also offers synchronous IBM terminal services for SNA/SDLC or
   bisync 3270, 3770, 5250, and 2780/3780 HASP devices.  Other Tymnet IBM
   data communications services include IBM's X.25 (QLLC) service, which
   provides support for X.25 including the 1984 CCITT recommendations and IBM
   QLLC compatibility; and the Tymnet Extension Cord Service, which supports
   IBM sychronous devices using the SDLC protocol.

      Tymnet provides local access from more than 600 locations in the U.S. 
   and from some 68 countries.  The company also has installed more private 
   networks than any other supplier.

                                #     #     #


      In addition, four vendors today announced their support of the X.PC 
   protocol.  Digisoft Computers Inc., LaSalle Micro In., Micro Tempus Inc., 
   and Western Union.

                 CIRCUIT REBUILD AND COMMAND CIRCUIT ROUTING
                 -------------------------------------------
                 -------------------------------------------


Written by : Sandra Nilluka, HQ Network Support

   CIRCUIT REBUILD


      Circuit rebuild is a feature that provides for broken virtual circuits
   to be re-constructed by the network, such that the user experiences a delay 
   in service during the rebuild process, but does not have to perform a login
   and loses no data.


      All of the following conditions must be met for a circuit to be success-
   fully rebuilt:

   1. Origination and destination nodes must be nodecode version 5.06 (or 
      higher) with rebuild enabled, and all intermediate nodes in a circuit's
      path must be nodecode version 5.xx.  This implies Solo and Isis; ATCs 
      do not support rebuild.  The orig. and dest. nodes will exchange control
      information on data successfully received and maintain history buffers 
      for re-transmission, should rebuild occur.

   2. There must be an alternate path available for construction of a replace-
      ment circuit path.  The link that went out will not be used in the new 
      path.

   3. The circuit breakage must be caused by a network link outage or an 
      intermediate node outage.  It can not be caused by a host crash, host 
      link outage, host disconnect, user disconnect, or orig./dest. node 
      crash.

   4. The command circuit of the destination node must be intact.  If the 
      circuit is down, the destination node does not exist, causing the 
      rebuild request to be rejected.  Currently, the sup holds off rebuild
      requests for 8 seconds before checking.

   5. The command circuit of the origination node must be intact.  If the 
      circuit is down, the node will not request circuit rebuild because the 
      node can not communicate with the supervisor.  

   6. The sup can not be saturated with rebuild requests.  Once its limit is 
      reached, the sup will reject rebuild requests.  The current public 
      network limit is 512 outstanding requests.

   7. The origination and destination nodes must be able to ensure no loss 
      of data.  If data cannot be provided from history buffers, or if the 
      nodes can not agree on control sequence numbers, the now-rebuilt circuit
      is immediately zapped.


      The rebuild option requires additional memory for the circuit rebuild 
   logic, and history buffers for each circuit originating or terminating in 
   the node.


      The impact on CPU utilization is not measured.  Data for eligible
   circuits must also be placed into history buffers.  The node must 
   periodically report control information.  Circuit outage would invoke the 
   rebuild process.



   COMMAND CIRCUIT ROUTING


      A command circuit is the circuit over which the node and supervisor
   communicate.  Its path is determined by the supervisor:

   1. At takeover time when the sup gains control of the network.

   2. At re-take time following a command circuit outage.

   3. At re-take time per Probe command request.

      There is no provision for designated routing.  One can not define which
   of a node's links will be used for its command circuit.


      For a given node, one could force the command circuit to use a specific
   link, by disconnecting or shutting all other links and then issuing a 
   re-take command.  If the disconnection caused the command circuit to be 
   zapped, re-take would automatically occur.  Upon re-take completion, the 
   other links could be re-connected or unshut.


      However, a subsequent takeover by a new supervisor or a re-take due to 
   loss of command circuit or Probe command results in command circuit path 
   re-calculation, and thus defeats the contrived path.

   RESTRICTION - TIIG  V5.13

      The Tymnet-II Gateway does NOT support IIX logins from the HNET side 
   (secondary network, pseudo-node side) when the HNET supervisor is version 
   40.01.

      This restriction will not be removed.  The circumvention is to upgrade 
   the HNET supervisor to version 41.01 or higher.



   PATCH RELEASE - TIIG  V5.13

      A new patch file TII05.P13 has been released by NTD.  It fixes a bug 
   that may have prevented successful IIX logins from the HNET side (secondary
   network, pseudo-node side).

      If you or your customers are using this Betatest product, please re-gen
   and re-load the gateway slot(s).  Support will be provided only for 
   upgraded slots.

   NOTE:  Previous release was February 12, 1986.

   Item 2: (Question: How is acknowledgement of frames sent from the host to 
            the terminal handled? - In particular, if the host interface
            acknowledges the frame as soon as it is received (early ack) where
            does the data get buffered, in the host interface? in the network?
            at the terminal interface?  If the terminal interface is presumed
            to be capable of buffering the data this may present problems for 
            other networks which have limited buffering capabilities at the 
            terminal interface.)
 

   Acknowledgement  
   ---------------
      As described in the DSP manual, after the HIF received a COMMAND, it
   performs local acknowledgement to the FEP before transmiting the COMMAND 
   to the terminal.  Same to the TIF that after the TIF received a RESPONSE, 
   the TIF performs local acknowledgement to the CU before transmiting the 
   RESPONSE to the host.
 

   Data Buffering
   --------------
      Only DATA is carried across the network. Logically, the data message is
   first stored in the HIF bufferlet(s), then put into the ORING waiting to 
   be sent to the TIF through the network.  Network package arrives at the 
   TIF, stored in the IRING first, then put into the bufferlet(s) to be sent 
   to the CU and terminal.
 
      At different times of each phase, data could stay in the HIF, the 
   Network or the TIF or all of these three, depending on when it is looked 
   at.
 
      There is an EDF (Early Data Forwarding) mechanism implemented in all of 
   the present versions of code to improve response time of data transmission.
   It avoids verifying checksums before using the data.  Before this "To 
   Terminal" EDF (Outbound) is implemented, messages from the customer's host
   (outbound), which may be as large as 1920 user data bytes a block, is sent
   to the HIF then to the TIF only when the ETX is received at the HIF.  The 
   TIF after receiving a STX, also waits for the ETX and then transmits the 
   whole message out to the Control Unit.
 
      Two constants RCVMIN & DYNBUF support the EDF mechanism.
 
   RCVMIN -- minimum number of character required to transmit. Defaulted
             to 64 bytes (40 in hex).
 
   DYNBUF -- switch to set dynamic buffer size for executing EDF. 
             Default is on.
 
      The EDF can be turned off by equating DYNBUF to 0. The bytes transmit
   limit can be changed by equating RCVMIN to value other than 40.
 
      If DYNBUF is on (the default), then once data has started to arrive
   from the FEP, the HIF starts to pass that data through the network.  That 
   is, the data bytes are sent to the TIF by HIF whenever RCVMIN hex bytes 
   (or ETX if is the last block) is received from the IBM host without waiting
   for the ETX.
 
      The TIF transmits these messages out to the control unit immediately 
   when each is received without waiting for the ETX either. Thus the two
   bisynchronous transmissions times can be partly overlapped.
 
      "To Host" Direction EDF is implemented in PBH 8.02 and PBT 6.01 up.  
   These new versions of code are in Betatest right now.
 
 
   Error Recovery (Forward Abort)
   ------------------------------
 
      If a checksum error is detected by the PBH and data was already sent 
   through the network, then any data still in the PBH is discarded and a 
   forward abort indication is sent through the network to the TIF.  The 
   forward abort is passed by the TIF and the previously received data is 
   discarded by the CU.  


   ADDENDUM:
   --------
   *   NTD suggested some clarification, in order to avoid confusion:

   1.  Setting of ACK-bit -- NTD indicated that it is only used in the special
       version, implemented for Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp.

       PBT 5.03, 5.05 and PBH 7.03, 7.05 all revealed that code to send the
       ACK Message, in response to a COMMAND/RESPONSE message with the ACK-
       bit set, is not implemented.  Since these codes do not support the ACK
       Message, they do not support the Setting of ACK-bit.


   2.  PVC in 3270 PBT is different from the PVC in X.25.

       If the PBT is configured for a PVC, the logon menu screen will not
       appear.  The logon process is done automatically as defined during the
       configuration of the PBT.  For PVC defined terminals, the flexibility 
       to access various hosts no longer exists.

       In the PBT code, there are routines to run periodically to check 
       whether or not a PVC-configured device needs to be logged on auto-
       matically.  The PVCTIM is defaulted to activiate the PVC timer every
       5 minutes.

        This article was initiated by the idea of distributing a
   '3270 Trouble-Shooting tip', nicely organized by Roseann Koralewski.
   As comments and suggestions were gathered, Steve Cortez and I started 
   adding more information to make it complete.
 
        Many thanks to DeeJong Tsao for his supervision and guidance 
   during this period. I also appreciate Paul Chu, of NTD, who provided
   comments and critics to increase the validity of this article.
 
        Please  note that the information, provided below, is for the  
   present versions of PBH and PBT codes only. The examples are from
   our trouble shooting experiences, based on our understanding of the
   code. If new versions of code have changes or if there is anything
   that needs more discussion, we will submit articles to Techtips
   later on.
 
 
   I. BACKGROUND
   
        There are times when we are trouble-shooting a 3270 HIF or TIF    
   problem, and data messages are suspected of becoming invalid during
   one of the transmission steps, thus we need to verify where this 
   happened and the cause.
 
        TIF and HIF both have a mechanism implemented to handle data
   transfer. For the 3270 HIF and TIF, there is a foreground process, 
   a background process, and several types of queues to be used
   between the foreground and background process. Each interface
   has the transmit queue (XMT) and receive queue (RCV) in addition
   to a set of queue related storage spaces.  Big Bufferlet, where the
   data message is stored before being processed, is the one that 
   provides useful information to help identify the problem.
 
        Below is a picture which shows the position of these queues
   in NATIVE mode environment.

   A. HOST INTERFACE
      ==============
 
   RCV queue -- stores the data received from the FEP on the BSC 
      line. Background processor will transform it into either DSP
      (NATIVE mode) messages or ASCII (VHM) strings to be delivered
      to the terminal.
 
   XMT queue -- stores the terminal data arrived from the network, 
      where data has been converted either from ASCII (VHM) or DSP
      (NATIVE mode) into BSC messages in the background process.
      The foreground will transmit this information to the FEP.
 
 
   B. TERMINAL INTERFACE
      ==================
 
   RCV queue -- stores the data received from the CU on the BSC
      line. Background processor will transform it into either
      DSP (NATIVE mode) messages or ASCII (VTM) strings to be
      delivered to the host.
 
   XMT queue -- stores the host data arrived from the network, 
      where the data has been converted either from ASCII (VTM)
      or DSP (NATIVE mode) into BSC messages in the background
      process. The foreground will transmit this information to
      the CU.
 
      There is also an IN and OUT queue in the Terminal Interface,
   related to the data transmission. They are not used in the
   examples in this documents, and omitted here.
 
 
 
   II.  DECIDE WHICH QUEUE TO EXAMINE
 
        The basic rules are:
 
   HIF RCV queue -- check the data received from FEP on the BSC line.
   HIF XMT queue -- check the data before sending it to FEP.
   TIF RCV queue -- check the data received from CU on the BSC line.
   TIF XMT queue -- check the data before sending it to CU.
 
        For example, if a print job does not get printed on the
   printer, we can close the HIF RCV gate to see if the WCC byte
   captured has its print bit set. If not, we know that the host
   application is the one that caused the problem. 
 
        Or we can check the target SBA (set buffer address) in the
   buffer to see what the HOST application requests the cursor
   location to be, and verify whether it is the CMT's conversion
   problem.
 
 


   III. TWO WAYS OF GETTING BUFFER INFORMATION
 
      A. Traditional way -
 
        Close gate to capture data message in the buffer, then
   perform command link read and buffer read. This method can be
   applied to all the versions of HIF and TIF versions with PBH 
   8.01 and 8.02 the only exceptions.
 
      Description of symbols to be used:
      ----------------------------------
 
      1. DEVTAB (device table) -- contains pointers pointing to
         the device control block of the corresponding devices.
 
      2. CMDLK (command link) --  stores sets of information for 
         each bufferlet on the link list. Each set has 8 bytes
         to specify: 
 
         a. if the first 2 bytes are positive, then they are the
            data size, bufferlet offset address, flag and the
            pointer points to next command link.
         b. if the first half word is negative, then the status
            information will be stored in the buffer. 
 
      3. BBUFER (big bufferlet) -- the starting address of the
         buffer storage that stores the data messages.
 
      4. RCVGAT (receive gate) -- bit array, each bit represents
         a corresponding device. bit = 1 if the receive gate is
         open. For example, if there are 16 devices, we need to
         read 4 bytes from RCVGAT. Suppose it reads out as FFF3
         (hex), that is 1111 1111 1111 0011 (binary). It reveals
         that device 12 (the 13th device from the left) and device
         13 (the 14th device from the left) both have the receive
         gate closed.
 
         To open device 12, write FFFB (1111 1111 1111 1011) to
         the RCVGAT. 
              
       5. GPRCV (get pointer of receive queue) -- contains the
          starting command link pointers for each device.
 
       6. RPRCV (release pointer of receive queue)  -- contains
          the ending command link pointers for each device.
 
          The transmit queue (XMT queue) also has the same functions
          as the receive queue, they are  XMTGAT, GPXMT and RPXMT.
 
 
 
 
 
 


          Inverted Bisync Translation 
          ---------------------------
          In the XMT queue, data bytes are prepared in inverted 
      format. Following is an example of using the first 24 data 
      bytes of PBT 5.03 XMT queue to show the way to decypher the
      data message:
   
        buffer   inverted      interpreted
        ======   ========      ===========
        40E4       0227        stx esc
        AF5E       F57A        erase write  WCC
        B80E       1D70        sf attribute  
        8802       1140        sba cursor address 
        6B2B       D6D4        cursor address M
        A747       E5E2        VS
        0647       60E2        -S
        EB02       D740        P space
        0247       40E2        space S
        1747       E8E2        YS
        C7A3       E3C5        TE
        2B02       D440        M space
 
        Two steps of inversion is needed: 
        a. Go to the table provided below to find the inverted 
           value for a byte.
        b. Then swap the two digit of this byte.
 
        for example: 40 --> 20  --> 02
                     AF --> 5F  --> F5
      
 
        Reversing Table
        ===============
          0   -->  0
          1   -->  8
          2   -->  4
          3   -->  C
          4   -->  2
          5   -->  A
          6   -->  6
          7   -->  E
          8   -->  1
          9   -->  9
          A   -->  5
          B   -->  D
          C   -->  3
          D   -->  B
          E   -->  7
          F   -->  F
 
 
 
 
 


 
     B. Query command through HBOM -- PBH 8.01 & 8.02 only
     
        HBOM is a Host Interface Bisync Operation Monitor. It can
     be called when log on into DDT. The commands related to the
     buffer data are:
 
     RCV query commands:
 
        1. STOPRCV  -- stop RCV queue process 
        2. QRCVQ    -- query data on RCV queue
        3. STARTRCV -- start RCV queue
 
     XMT query commands:
 
        1. STOPXMT  -- stop XMT queue process
        2. QXMTQ    -- query data on XMT queue
        3. STARTXMT -- start XMT queue

      Many of you have been asking, "How many devices can one SNA/CMT be
   genned for, before more SNA/CMT slots and a Network Connection need to be
   ordered?"
 
      The answer is; SNA/CMT can support approximately 45 devices.  That's 23 
   simultaneous users, with CRT's and Printers and 19 terminal types, or 45 
   simultaneous CRT's and 19 terminal types.  (Note:  23 users, with printers,
   will give a very slow response time in most applications.  45 simultaneous
   users will exceed the capacity of even a 14.4 line in most applications.) 

      The memory capacity of the engine is fully utilized with these configur-
   ations.  This means you will need to order another SNA/CMT and Network
   Connection if you need more device addresses.  This question will come up 
   if:

   a. one-to-one addressing is being used for either security or printer 
      support.
   b. wild card addressing is being used for CRT's only, and the number of 
      simultaneous users the customer expects in the "busy hour" exceeds the 
      capacity of the Network Connection.
 
      What if your customer has more simultaneous users, fewer terminal types
   or requires more device addresses?
 
   1. The Field CC will need to figure out what you can support in one
      Engine.  (In order to help you, guidelines have been prepared and are
      available in Ontyme *** SNA/CMT.SIZE.  These guidelines contain infor-
      mation collected from NTD, Tech Svcs, and Management Sciences and 
      contain the necessary formulas to model memory size.  Once a configur-
      ation has been modeled, then the CC should gen it to make sure each 
      SNA/CMT/NetConnection will fit in the memory of 1 Engine.  If it fits in
      1 Engine, you can then submit your order.
 
   2. At the present time, a special configuration with special pricing, is 
      available for SNA/CMT that will support approximately 75 to 86 devices.
      CAUTION!!, If 86 devices are genned, then the engine is fully utilized 
      and there is no room for upgrades, patches, etc.  Once again it is a 
      good idea to have your CC gen this to make sure your SNA configuration 
      will fit on 1 Engine.  If you need this special arrangement you should
      contact Product Marketing for pricing information before you quote 
      prices to your customers.  This configuration consists of a mini-Engine 
      for SNA, and a Micro hardwired to the mini for the CMT.
 
   What other alternatives do you have?
 
   1. Consider using Bisync.  At the present time, all IMS shops must use this
      option if they require printers.  Additionaly, 1 slot can support 255 
      device addresses and the CMT will comfortably allow as many simultaneous
      users as the Network Connection will allow.  All this will fit in 1 
      Engine's memory.
 
   How many simultaneous users will a Network Connection support?
 
      This is very dependent upon the customers application.  Experience has 
   shown that the number of simultaneous users can vary from as few as 10 to 
   as many as 25 before response time is impacted.
 
   What's going to be available in the future?

      CRM4 will be ready for beta test this year.  Bisync will be ready in 
   3Q86 and SNA in 4Q86.  This will allow wild card addressing to be used for
   CRT and Printer pairing.  This will help because the HIF slot will only 
   need to be genned for the number of simultaneous users expected.  
   (Reminder:  The Network Connection(s) has to be considered first to make
   sure it will handle the expected traffic in the busiest hour.)

   WARNING - TII V5.11

      When using the Xray "DB" command, DO NOT use more than five (5) nodes 
   in the node list.


      For the following versions of nodecode, the Xray "DB" command (with a 
   node list exceeding five (5) nodes) will crash the node in which Xray is 
   running:
   
                          20511 - Solo Consat
                          00511 - Solo Switcher
                          10511 - Isis Nodecode



      This problem will be fixed in the next betatest release of nodecode 
   version 5.11.

                  EXPLANATION OF TYMNET'S NETWORK SECURITY
                  ----------------------------------------
                  ----------------------------------------


Written by : Steve White, Field Communication's Consultant
             ** Originally written as a response to a customer's enquiry **




      THANK YOU FOR YOU ENQUIRY REGARDING THE PASSWORD SECURITY, OFFERED BY 
   TYMNET.  IN REPLY TO YOUR TELEX, I SHALL ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS IN THE ORDER
   IN WHICH YOU GAVE THEM, BUT FIRST, SOME GENERAL INFORMATION:


      TYMNET USES USERNAMES/PASSWORDS TO CONTROL THREE SECURITY ORIENTED 
   FUNCTIONS:

   a) IS THIS USER AN AUTHORISED USER?
   b) IS THIS USER ALLOWED TO ORIGINATE A CALL FROM THIS POSITION IN THE 
      NETWORK?
   c) IS THIS USER ALLOWED TO PLACE A CALL TO THE REQUESTED DESTINATION?

      FUNCTION (a), IS ACHIEVED BY THE NETWORK SUPERVISOR (CENTRAL ROUTING
   COMPUTER), WHICH CHECKS THAT THE USERNAME IS PRESENT ON IT'S MASTER USER
   DIRECTORY (MUD) AND THAT THE PASSWORD GIVEN, MATCHES.  (NOTE: THE PASSWORD
   IS SCRAMBLED AND IS NOT KEPT ANYWHERE, BY THE NETWORK, IN ITS NATIVE FORM.)
   THERE ARE FIVE NETWORK SUPERVISORS (ON PUBLIC TYMNET).  EACH HAS ITS OWN 
   MUD WHICH IS UPDATED FROM A SINGLE CONTROLLING USER DIRECTORY (CUD).  ONLY
   ONE SUPERVISOR IS ACTIVE CONTROLLING THE NETWORK AT ANY GIVEN TIME.  THE 
   OTHERS ARE ON HOT STANDBY.

      FUNCTIONS (b) AND (c) ARE ACHIEVED BY DEFINING CLASSES AND GROUPS.  A
   CLASS OR GROUP CONSISTS OF A NUMBER OF NODES (SWITCHES) AND/OR HOSTS.

   CLASS = A SET OF ORIGINATION POINTS IN THE NETWORK.
   GROUP = A SET OF DESTINATION POINTS IN THE NETWORK.

      EACH USERNAME HAS AN ASSOCIATED PROFILE (KEPT ON THE CUD AND MUD) SET AT
   THE TIME IT IS ISSUED AND CHANGABLE ONLY BY VALIDATION'S PERSONNEL.  THE
   CLASSES IN THE PROFILE DEFINE 'WHERE', ON TYMNET, THIS USERNAME MAY ENTER
   THE NETWORK AND A LIST OF HOSTS OR GROUPS, IN THE PROFILE, DEFINE WHERE THE
   USERNAME MAY PLACE A CALL TO.


   CALL ORIGINATION POINT CHECK - FUNCTION(b)
   ------------------------------------------

   THE SUPERVISOR CHECKS THAT THE LOCATION, FROM WHICH A USERNAME IS LOGGING
   INTO THE NETWORK, APPEARS IN AT LEAST ONE CLASS IN THE USERNAME'S PROFILE.
   IF THE USERNAME IS VALID, BUT THE USER'S PROFILE DOES NOT ALLOW ACCESS FROM
   THIS LOCATION, THEN THE MESSAGE "ACCESS NOT PERMITTED" IS ISSUED AND THE
   USER IS INVITED TO "PLEASE LOG IN:  ".

   CALL DESTINATION CHECK - FUNCTION (c)
   -------------------------------------

   THE DESTINATION OF THE CALL MAY BE DETERMINED COMPLETELY BY THE PROFILE OF
   THE USERNAME, IN WHICH CASE THE CALL GETS ROUTED TO ONE OF A LIST OF HOSTS
   IN THE PROFILE.  WHICH HOST RECEIVES THE CALL, IS DETERMINED BY A SET OF
   PRIORITIES AND/OR THE LEAST "COST" ROUTE TO A HOST IN THE SET OF
   ALTERNATIVES.  COST IS NOT A MONETARY VALUE; IT IS A COMPLEX CALCULATION
   BASED ON NETWORK RESOURCE UTILIZATION AT THE TIME OF THE CALL.

   THE USER MAY HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO SPECIFY A DESIRED DESTINATION:  SEE THE
   DESCRIPTION OF <HOST NAME FIELD> BELOW.  WITH THIS CAPABILITY, THE
   SUPERVISOR CHECKS THAT THE REQUESTED DESTINATION IS LISTED IN THE USERNAME
   PROFILE.  IF THE REQUESTED DESTINATION IS NOT FOUND IN THE PROFILE THEN A
   MESSAGE "ACCESS BARRED" IS GIVEN TO THE USER AND THEN AN INVITATION TO
   "PLEASE LOG IN:"  IS GIVEN.  A USERNAME ALWAYS HAS A DEFAULT DESTINATION SO
   THAT IF THE USER MAKES NO SELECTION THEN ONE IS MADE BASED ON THE USERNAME
   PROFILE.

   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   NOW, TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS EACH IN TURN....

   1) A USERNAME ON TYMNET MAY CONSIST OF THE CHARACTERS :
      A-Z, a-z, 0-9, dash (-), slash (/), period (.), comma (,) and the 
      asterisk (*).

   note: usernames that are purely numeric, may only be issued by TYMNET
         validations personnel and are reserved for TYMNET's implementation
         of X.121.

      A PASSWORD ON TYMNET MAY CONSIST OF CHARACTERS:
      A-Z, a-z, 0-9, space, dash, slash, period, comma, asterisk, hash (#), 
      dollar ($) and ampersand (&).  Alpha-Control characters may be used 
      also, but PAD users should be careful to AVOID the PAD RECALL character
      (CTRL-P is commonly used for PAD recall) and the user-data separator 
      (often a comma). 

   2) THE MAXIMUM LENGTH OF A USERNAME ON PUBLIC TYMNET IS 12 CHARS.  (TRUNC-
      ATION IS AUTOMATIC WITHOUT A MESSAGE.)
      THE MAXIMUM LENGTH OF A PASSWORD ON PUBLIC TYMNET IS 30 CHARS.
      THE MINIMUM LENGTH OF A PASSWORD IS THE NULL PASSWORD (CARRIAGE RETURN).

      TYMNET RECOMMENDS PASSWORDS BE AT LEAST 7 CHARACTERS LONG TO GIVE
      ADEQUATE SECURITY.  WE ALSO ADVISE THAT THERE SHOULD BE AT LEAST ONE 
      NON-ALPHA CHARACTER.
   
   NOTE: THESE RESTRICTIONS DO NOT APPLY TO PRIVATE NETWORKS, BASED ON TYMNET
   TECHNOLOGY.

   3) AN ALGORITHM IS USED TO DETERMINE THE TIME AND THE NUMBER OF ATTEMPTS 
      A USER MAY HAVE TO ENTER THE CORRECT USERNAME/PASSWORD COMBINATION.  
      EACH FAILED ATTEMPT TO ENTER A USERNAME OR PASSWORD, ADDS TO A 'PENALTY
      SCORE'.  IF THE PENALTY SCORE EXCEEDS A PRESET VALUE, THE FOLLOWING 
      MESSAGE IS ISSUED AND THE CALL CLEARED.  SIGNALS TO THE MODEM ARE 
      DROPPED SO THE USER MUST RE-DIAL TO TRY AGAIN.
  
      "PLEASE SEE YOUR REPRESENTATIVE IF YOU ARE HAVING TROUBLE LOGGING IN"

      THE ALGORITHM ALLOWS FOR 3 ATTEMPTS TO ENTER THE USERNAME AND PASSWORD,
      ANY COMBINATION OF THREE ATTEMPTS IS ALLOWED.  FOR EXAMPLE:  IF THE USER
      ENTERS HIS USERNAME 2 TIMES INCORRECTLY AND THEN GETS IT CORRECT ON THE
      THIRD ATTEMPT, HE HAS ONLY ONE ATTEMPT TO GET THE PASSWORD ENTERED 
      CORRECTLY.

      ENTERING <ESCAPE>, AT ANYTIME DURING LOG-IN, ABORTS THE LOG-IN AND 
      CAUSES THE "PLEASE LOG IN: " PROMPT TO BE RE-ISSUED.  <ESCAPE> DOES ADD
      TO THE 'PENALTY SCORE' THUS REDUCING THE NUMBER OF ATTEMPTS THE USER MAY
      MAKE TO ENTER THE CORRECT USERNAME AND PASSWORD.

   EXAMPLE:  IF THE USER USED 3 <ESCAPES>'S, THEN TWO ATTEMPTS AT THE
             USERNAME/PASSWORD WOULD THEN BE ALLOWED.
   
      THE TIMEOUT LIMIT IS 2 MINUTES FOR NO ACTIVITY.  THERE IS NO PENALTY 
      APPLIED TO THE USERNAME SO THE USER MAY IMMEDIATELY RE-DIAL AND PLACE 
      FURTHER CALL ATTEMPTS.  A LOG IS KEPT OF FAILED CALL ATTEMPTS BY THE 
      NETWORK SUPERVISOR.  THIS LOG IS EXAMINED BY NETWORK SECURITY PERSONNEL.

   4) I AM NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE REFERRRING TO, WHEN ASKING
      ABOUT DOUBLE PASSWORDS.  HERE ARE SOME OF THE POSSIBILITIES:

      AT THE PLEASE LOG IN PROMPT, A USER MAY ENTER :
      <USERNAME>:<HOST NAME FIELD>;<PASSWORD>

      THE <HOST NAME FIELD> AND <PASSWORD> ARE OPTIONAL.  TYPICALLY, A USER
      ENTERS JUST THE USERNAME AND PASSWORD.  THE USER'S CALL IS ROUTED BASED
      ON THE PROFILE OF THE USERNAME.  THE USERNAME MAY BE MULTI-TARGETTED, 
      PRIORITY TARGETTED, OR MULTI/PRIORITY TARGETTED TO A GROUP OF HOSTS ON 
      WHICH THIS USER IS ALLOWED ACCESS.


   THE FOUR DISTINCT USES FOR THE HOST NAME FIELD ARE AS FOLLOWS....
   
   SIMPLE USE OF THE <HOST NAME FIELD>
   -----------------------------------

   BY PLACING A TYMNET HOST NUMBER IN THE FIELD AFTER THE COLON(:), THE USER
   MAY BE ABLE TO DIRECT HIS CALL TO A PARTICULAR HOST, OUT OF THE SET OF 
   HOSTS TO WHICH HIS USERNAME ALLOWS HIM TO GO.  SUCH A USERNAME IS SAID TO 
   HAVE THE 'COLON OPTION'.  MANY, PERHAPS MOST, USERNAMES ARE SET-UP TO 
   IGNORE THE COLON OPTION IN WHICH CASE DATA IN THE <HOST NAME FIELD> IS 
   IGNORED BY THE SUPERVISOR DURING ROUTING AND THE CALL IS ROUTED (IF THE 
   USERNAME/PASSWORD IS VALID) ACCORDING TO THE USERNAME PROFILE.

   SUB-HOST ADDRESSING (:HHHHH.SSSS)
   ---------------------------------

   IF THE USERNAME HAS THE CAPABILITY TO SELECT A DESTINATION FROM IT'S
   PROFILE, THEN IT ALSO MAY SPECIFY A SUB-HOST ADDRESS.  THIS IS DONE BY
   INSERTING A PERIOD (.)  IN THE <HOST NAME FIELD>.

   FOR EXAMPLE:  
                    PLEASE LOG IN: <USERNAME>:.02;<PASSWORD>

   REQUESTS THE CALL BE ROUTED TO THE DEFAULT HOST FOR <USERNAME> AND SELECTS
   SUB-HOST 02.  A HOST COULD ALSO HAVE BEEN SPECIFIED BEFORE THE PERIOD.  
   FOUR DIGITS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE SUB-HOST.

   TARGET PROFILES
   ---------------

   THE <HOST NAME FIELD> MAY ALSO BE USED FOR 'OUTBOUND' USERS (PLACING CALLS
   TO OTHER NETS) TO ENTER THE DNIC OF THEIR DESTINATION AND OPTIONALLY THE 
   TNIC OF THE INTERNATIONAL RECORD CARRIER THEY WISH TO USE.  FOR EXAMPLE 
   USERNAME 'T.OUTGOING' MAY BE SET UP TO ALLOW THE USER TO ENTER....

   T.OUTGOING:G4408T3119;<PASSWORD>

   IF THIS USERNAME/PASSWORD IS CORRECT, THEN THE CALL GETS SET-UP TO GO TO
   JAPAN VIA TRT TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND THE USER IS PROMPTED TO ENTER THE REST
   OF THE X.121 ADDRESS.  THIS USE OF THE <HOST NAME FIELD>, WE CALL 'TARGET 
   PROFILES'.
    
   NOTE: This is a relatively new feature and is not the way all 'outbound'
         calls are placed.

   HOST NAMES
   ---------- 

   THE FOURTH USE FOR THE <HOST NAME FIELD> IS CALLED 'HOST NAMES' AND IT MAY
   WELL BE THAT THIS IS THE FEATURE ABOUT WHICH YOU WERE ENQUIRING.

   THIS FEATURE IS DUE FOR RELEASE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 1987.  IT WILL 
   ENABLE THE USER TO ENTER AN ALPHA-NUMERIC NAME IN THE FIELD AFTER THE
   COLON - A HOST NAME.  THIS WILL BE A TYPE OF USERNAME, ASSOCIATED WITH THE
   USERNAME BEFORE THE COLON, POSSIBLY REQUIRING A SECOND PASSWORD.  THE HOST
   NAME IS USED TO ROUTE THE CALL IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE USERNAME AND ALLOWS 
   THE USER TO USE MORE NATURAL LANGUAGE TO LOG IN.  THE USAGE EXAMPLE THAT 
   FOLLOWS IS, I HOPE, SELF EXPLANATORY AND ILLUSTRATES HOW FRIENDLY SUCH A 
   SYSTEM WILL BE TO USE.

   PLEASE LOG IN : BIG-COMPANY:JAPAN-HQ;<PASSWORD1>;<PASSWORD2>

   PLEASE LOG IN : BIG-COMPANY:USA-HQ;<PASSWORD1>;<PASSWORD2>

   NOTE: THE PASSWORDS ARE OPTIONAL

   THERE ARE SO MANY POSSIBILITIES FOR THIS, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO GO INTO 
   THEM HERE AND SINCE THIS FEATURE IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT IT IS NOT 
   APPROPRIATE TO TRY AND GIVE DETAILS WHICH MAY BE SUBJECT TO CHANGE.


   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


      TYMNET'S X.121 ADDRESSING SCHEME ALSO HAS SEVERAL SECURITY FEATURES
   MANY OF WHICH, WE BELIEVE, ARE UNIQUE TO TYMNET.

      VERY BRIEFLY, THERE ARE 4 POSSIBILITIES FOR A TYMNET HOST AS FAR AS 
   EXTERNAL NETWORK ACCESS IS CONCERNED:

   1) ACCESS FROM GATEWAYS NOT ALLOWED.
   2) ACCESS FROM GATEWAYS WITH FULL X.121 ADDRESS AND PASSWORD REQUIRED 
      BEFORE THE CIRCUIT IS BUILT.
   3) ACCESS FROM GATEWAYS WITH ABBREVIATED X.121 ADDR "31069" WHICH CAUSES 
      THE TYMNET SUPERVISOR TO REQUEST A VALID USERNAME/PASSWORD BEFORE
      CIRCUIT IS BUILT.
   4) ACCESS WITH A FULL X.121 ADDR (SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FORMAT) WITH NO
      NETWORK SECURITY REQUIREMENT TO FULFILL BEFORE THE CIRCUIT IS BUILT.

      THE X.121 ADDRESSING SCHEME TYMNET EMPLOYS ALSO ALLOWS FOR ONE ADDRESS 
   TO BE PRIORITY-TARGETTED, MULTI-TARGETTED OR MULTI/PRIORITY TARGETTED TO A
   SET OF HOSTS.  THIS ALLOWS A SINGLE ADDRESS TO BE USED TO DIRECT A CALL TO
   ONE OF A SET OF PRIMARY HOSTS (CHOSEN BY THE LEAST COST PATH THROUGH THE 
   NET) OR IF NONE OF THE FIRST PRIORITY HOSTS ARE AVAILABLE TO GO TO ONE OF 
   A SET OF SECOND PRIORITY HOSTS (CHOSEN BY LEAST COST) AND SO ON.

      WE HAVE FOUND THE SCHEME IS FLEXIBLE TO CUSTOMER'S NEEDS AND HAS THE 
   POWER TO CONTROL ACCESS FROM FOREIGN NETS TO AN EXACTING DEGREE.

      NATURALLY, TYMNET CANNOT GUARD AGAINST THE NEGLIGENT USE OF USERNAME/
   PASSWORDS BY THEIR RIGHTFUL OWNERS, HOWEVER PASSWORD CHANGES CAN BE 
   EFFECTED IN ABOUT 20 MINUTES FOR USERNAMES WHOSE PASSWORDS HAVE BEEN 
   COMPROMISED.

      Date : April 14, 1986




      TMCS version 10.00 has just been released to the BASELINE by NTD. 
   There are two major functions introduced in version 10.00 - RELOAD and 
   ALARM which would require either a specially configured s/w environment, or
   that of h/w.  Please read the following, carefully, if you are a technical
   support person, otherwise you may skip the middle section and jump to the
   CONCLUSION.



      In order to facilitate the RELOAD functions in TMCS version 10.00, a
   special software configuration will be required.  The basics of this s/w 
   environment consists of the following elements:

         ISIS     version 5.08 or up             5.08 is in full release

    Node Code     version 5.10                   5.10 is in betatest

     Sup Code     version 41.02 or up            41.02 is in betatest

          ELF     version 3.10 or up             3.10 is in full release

     
      However, we recommend a modified list of the above configuration, due
   to the comlicacy involved in the support of multi-version and multi-release
   for the products, especially the Node Code and Sup Code.

      Let me first brief you on the status of existing betatest versions
   of N.C. and Sup Code:

   CONCLUSION
   ----------

      TMCS version 10.00, without the RELOAD/ALARM, is considered to be in
   full release and compatible with the full release version of ISIS(5.08), 
   Node Code(5.06), Sup(41.01) and ELF(3.10).

      TMCS version 10.00, WITH the RELOAD/ALARM, is pulled back to the beta-
   test status and requires the following s/w configuration recommended by 
   Hqtech with consent of HQQA and NTD:

          ISIS      version 5.08                 full release

     Node Code      version 5.10                 betatest

      Sup Code      version 41.04                betatest

           ELF      version 4.00                 betatest

        CONSAT      version 3.07                 full release  (for ALARM)


      Therefore, to install TMCS 10.00 with the RELOAD/ALARM, the standard 
   procedures for acquiring the usage of betatest products must be followed 
   through Marketing and HQQA.

 

   DOCUMENTATION
   --------------

      The Reference Manual, for version 10.00, is to be ready for the final
   review.  This cycle will take anywhere from one week to a month or so.
   After the feekback is collected, it has to go through the preparation of
   production and then will be sent to the Printer.  We understand the 
   inconvenience this may have caused you and the customers, as it has on us,
   but please be patient while the Documentation group is trying its best to
   work out the schedule.  In the interim, make use of the Baseline documents
   and any Techtips coming your way, and of course, we are always here to
   answer any questions and provide you with assistance.

                      TECHALERT -- TAPE DRIVE PROBLEMS
                      --------------------------------
                      --------------------------------


Written by : Shirley Chiang, HQ Mgr. Application's Support
      Date : April 15, 1986




      During the past two months, a few incidents have occurred and esca-
   lated to us, in regard to the tape problems when running RAM (Raw Account-
   ing Merger) version 10.05 or 10.07.  It took us an extroadinary amount of
   time and effort to find that some of these were hardware related faults and
   actually should have been checked out upon installation; in particular, 
   problems such as tape running off the reel, drive intermittenly going off-
   line, or data density errors.

      These problems are not necessarily associated with RAM, but since RAM is
   the one application that makes the most use of the tape unit as its primary
   data storage medium, these symptoms tend to be mostly seen along with this
   product.

       To avoid any waste of time in the future, should similar situations
   occur in your support area, I'd like to share our experiences and strongly
   recommend that you read the followings carefully.  After reading my memo, 
   you may even want to walk up to the tape drive nearby and check the 
   installation as preventive action.

      Currently there are two types of tape drives - Kennedy 9000 and 9100,
   supported by Tymnet Engines.  They interface with the Engines through
   TC-140 tape controller, manufactured by Western Peripherals.  The tape
   driver routine, in ISIS, does not distinguish between these different
   models as they are made compatible at the controller level.  In other 
   words, it is transparent to the operating system and application software.

      The way ISIS retrieves the device status is by issuing the SSR command
   to sense the standard or normal status which includes eight bits for error,
   e-o-f, e-o-t or b-o-t, no motion, busy, examine, end-of-medium and device 
   unavialable.  If the Extended Status is desired, an additional OC (output 
   Command) instruction, with a hex value of 33, must be executed prior to the
   SSR command.  The Extended status also has eight bits for parity error, 
   timing error, rewinding, illegal command, high density, file protected, 
   b-o-t and 9-track.

      However, in the current versions of ISIS, the Extended status has always
   been sensed before the normal status, which is not recommended by Interdata
   and is different from the way the stand-alone tape diagonostics handle it,
   although so far we have not had sufficient evidence to prove it a problem.

      At any rate, there is somthing in the h/w setup you want to pay special
   attention to, as it will definitely affect the tape operations:


   1.  Speed chip on the tape controller board

       -  Use the chip of part number 120023-5 (or 01200237-5) for 75 IPS
          on Kennedy 9100 drives been widely installed for almost all of
          our applications using the tape unit, such as RAM, Netval, TMCS
          and Network Console.
 
          [note: chip part number 120023-4 (or 01200237-4) is for 45 IPS
          on Kennedy 9000.]

       -  This chip locates at A24 on the tape controller board and the part
          number is on the bottom of the chip.

   Symptom if incorrect chip is mounted:

       -  Causing data errors at 1600 density.


   2.  Address switch on the tape drive

       -  Be sure the seating and wire connection are secured.

   Symptom if switch is not seated properly or the wire connection is loose:
  
       -  Causing the device to go off-line intermittenly.


   3.  The miniature dip switch on the Tape Control Adapter paddle board
       (plugged to the back of the tape drive)

       -  This set of Congfiguration Switches includes 8 switches and must
          be set as follows:

          S1    S2    S3    S4    S5    S6    S7    S8
          off   on    off   off   off   off   on    off
                ---                           ---

       -  Switch #2 and #7 MUST BE SET ON for Kennedy drives.

       -  On top of other functions, Switch #2 actually governs the signaling
          of end-of-tape and the transfer of this signal to the controller
          so the s/w can recognize the e-o-t.

          [note: reference page 2-10 and 2-15 of "Model TC-140/148 Tape
          Controller Hardware Manual", published by Western Peripherals
          on March, 1978.]

    Symptom if swich #2 is set off:

       -  Causing the controller not able to sense the e-o-t and conse-
          quently the applications s/w to continue writing to the tape
          and eventually the tape going off the reel.


      If you encounter the above described symptoms and still fail to correct
   the problems with our suggested methods, please let us know immediately.

      Thanks to Richard Ho, of NTS, for providing the specific h/w informa-
   tion.

                         TYMNET-TELEX TRUNK GATEWAY
                         --------------------------
                         --------------------------


      Date : April 16, 1986




    Integrated Communications Applications is pleased to announce the
    Tymnet-to-Telex Gateway using Telex Trunk Signalling.  The Gateway
    permits Telex subscribers to reach a Telex center through Tymnet,
    instead of dedicating a leased line to their Telex machine.  The
    Gateway further permits owners of IBM PC's to subscribe to Telex;
    with our PC Message Handler software, FMH, the PC receives Telex
    messages in real time in the background, while the user runs normal
    PC applications.
 
    This interface provides direct Telex connection, rather than store-
    and-forward service.  It permits conversational Telex, where the
    parties alternately type questions and answers to each other.
 
    Customers who connect to the Gateway with more than one terminal,
    can pool their terminals, to receive each message on any available
    terminal.  Combinations of PC's and Telex machines can be grouped.
 
    The Gateway currently communicates with FTCC's Telex center using
    a form of the common trunk signalling used by the various Telex
    companies to interconnect with each other.  The Gateway software is
    flexible and easily adjusted for hookup to any Telex company.
 
 
Hooking up Subscribers
 
    A subscriber using a Telex machine must be hooked up to a dedicated
    port on a Consat, version 3.05 or later.  A PVC is configured for
    the subscriber to reach the Gateway.  The Telex machine must use
    EIA signal levels; if it uses Current Loop signalling, the machine
    requires a conversion.
 
    A subscriber with a PC is usually hooked up through modems and a
    dedicated line, to a dedicated port on any convenient Tymsat, and
    usually a PVC is configured.  The FMH software from FTCC is
    installed in the Customer's PC. Customers wanting non-PVC service,
    and/or dial-up, should discuss their needs with our
    representatives.
 
 
 
Signalling between the Gateway and the Telex Center
 
    Telex companies commonly interconnect from one to another using
    forms of trunk signalling which they designate Type-A, Type-B, and
    Type-C.
 
    The Gateway, as released, uses a certain combination of subscriber
    and Telex Type-A Trunk signalling.  A Telex center contemplating
    connection with Type-A signalling should check the details with our
    representatives.
 
    The Telex center must connect to a Tymnet Engine using EIA signal
    levels; Current-Loop signals must go through a signal converter.
 
    Type-B and Type-C signalling: The Gateway is flexible, and could be
    adapted for Type-B or Type-C signalling with a small development
    effort.
 
 
 
Store-and-Forward Service
 
    McDonnell-Douglas already offers a Telex Store-And-Forward service
    through Ontyme and FTCC.  The customer subscribes to Ontyme and to
    FTCC's MACS service.  The customer can then both prepare Telexes on
    Ontyme and receive Telexes; FTCC's MACS system periodically calls
    into Ontyme to pick up Telexes which the customer prepared and to
    give the customer all received messages.
 
    The customer uses any type of terminal which communicates with
    Ontyme.
 
 
 
Possible Additional Applications
 
    We have proposed enhancements to widen opportunities to provide
    customers with Telex service through Tymnet.  These enhancements
    are not presently scheduled, but will be prioritized if there is
    sufficient market.  The main proposals are:
 
      o Use of Ascii terminals through Tymnet for a) direct Telex
        transmission, and b) reception.
 
      o Direct connection of Ascii terminals through Tymnet to FTCC's
        MACS Store-and-Forward service, without Ontyme.
 
      o Use of Tymnet to connect Telex centers, either for a single
        Telex company or between companies, replacing their
        long-distance trunk lines with Tymnet service.
 
      o Use Tymnet to do dial-out service for a Telex company.  Telex
        companies presently use special hardware to perform dial-out
        to customers, and must do a hardware change for every customer
        update.
 
        Replace the Telex company's special hardware with software;
        simplify their updates of customers.  (The dial-out would most
        likely be performed in the Telex company's private Tymsat, and
        would not require additional Tymnet development outside of the
        Telex Gateway.  Particularly, this would not require Tymnet's
        proposed dial-out directory service, referred to as
        "out-dial".)
 
      o Permit Telex callers to log-in to arbitrary services on Tymnet.
        This would permit all Telex subscribers to use their Telex
        machine as a general-purpose terminal, for data base queries
        etc.
 
      o Telex service directly between two customers on Tymnet, without
        going through a Telex Switch.

      Merlin, new version 2.10, is now available on all Tymnet systems. 
   Changes in this version are:

   1). Merlin will now bind the Split-Kernel Supervisor.  Previously, files
       were loaded seperately through the Split-Kernel but now can be
       bound into a single loadable file.

   2). Bug fix for problem in how segments in Pascal slots tagged in the
       CTA table (for use by ISRS).

      If you have any questions on the new version of Merlin, please call me
   at (408)-942-5190 or send an Ontyme message to NSS.F/CHEN.

           QUESTION & ANSWER REGARDING CONTROL FIELD IN MUD BUFFER
           -------------------------------------------------------
           -------------------------------------------------------


Question by : Thomas Chow, Int'l Communication Consultant
Response by : Jeff Liu, HQ Network Staff Consultant




ORIGINAL QUESTION:

   'TYPE MUD' after a 'READ MUD' doesn't display the control field.  However, 
   after a 'READ CUD', the control field in the MUD buffer is shown.  Why is 
   the control field in MUD buffer displayed after a READ CUD instead of a 
   READ MUD?                                         --------
   --------



RESPONSE:

   In Netval version 1.14, 'TYPE MUD' after a 'READ MUD' doesn't display the
   Control field; but after 'READ CUD', a flag is turned on to display the
   control field and then 'TYPE MUD' will also display the control field
   identical to the control field of TYPE CUD.  If the operator wants to
   compare the CUD and MUD blocks, then use "COmpare" command to display
   the differences or output "NO DIFFERENCES" if all words are in the
   CUD and MUD blocks match.  "TYPE CUD" and "TYPE MUD" will not tell the
   operator if both blocks are identical since many fields are not displayed
   such as password.

        QUESTIONS & ANSWER REGARDING 'HOW TO DEFINE MESSAGE IN MSGTEX' 
        --------------------------------------------------------------
        --------------------------------------------------------------


Question by : Pauline Campbell, Tymnet Communication Consultant
Response by : Dianna Tai, HQ Network Staff Consultant




ORIGINAL QUESTION:

   I WANT TO SEND THE DISCONNECT MESSAGE : 

             00 06 D3 D6 C7 C6 C6 04 06 01 06 83 00 F3 00
   
   TO THE VTAM (VMCP) F.E., BUT DO NOT KNOW HOW TO TRANSLATE THE NON GRAPHIC
   CHARACTERS FOR THE 'MSGTEX' OPTION.  IS THERE A CHART THAT WE HAVE TO 
   TRANSLATE ALL EBCDIC CHARS (HEX) INTO RECOGNIZABLE FORM FOR THE OPTION?




RESPONSE:
 
   The chart you requested can be found on the TYMNET ENGINE POCKET GUIDE, 
   page 5 and 6.  Besides this, there are several rules you can follow
   to define the disconnect message in MSGTEX:
 
   1. Upper case alphabetic characters A to Z can all be defined by graphic 
      symbols, ended with a period.
 
   2. Space (HEX 40) can be defined as SP. (note: also ends with a period).
 
   3. Other characters, including the lower case characters, numerical
      characters, and other symbols have to be entered by their HEX values.
      They do not need to be followed by a period.
 
   4. The 2 digit's HEX value will not be accepted by NAD, at gen time, if it 
      starts with the alphabetical character: A to F.  To avoid that, add an
      '0' before this value. 
 
   5. The message will be put into specific memory location preceeded by the 
      control unit address and device address and ready to send out at the 
      appropriate time.
 
      The disconnect message you indicated can be defined as follows:
      MSGTEX(00,06,L.,O.,G.,F.,F.,04,06,01,06,83,00,0F3,00)
 
      Please note that since this message is a long read format, you might 
      need to add an AID followed by 2 bytes cursor address in front of the
      whole message. Please discuss with the customer on this issue.

      ASSOCIATED PRINTER SUPPORT FOR CMT MODE FOR A TOTAL OF 255 DEVICES
      ------------------------------------------------------------------
      ------------------------------------------------------------------


Question by : Carolyn Weidner, Tymnet Communication Consultant
Response by : Dianna Tai, HQ Network Staff Consultant

  


ORIGINAL QUESTION:

   A customer currently has 128 ports which are specific targetted.  Patch 
   located under (DTAI:54)ITT128.PAT was written to permit 128 devices.  The 
   customer now requests associated printer support for these devices.  I have 
   been told that we can support a total of 255 devices per interface.  Should
   I interpret this as eight complete control units, or eight control units 
   minus one device?  What restrictions should I be aware of when attempting 
   this?  (ex.-number of simultaneious users, targetting restrictions, is this
   patch still valid, core requirements, has this ever been done before) 






RESPONSE:

   1. PBH, as well as, PBT can only support up to 255 devices per slot.
      That is, 8 control unit minus one device.

   2. The number of simultaneous users to be defined in the tymfile depends 
      on the load of the node and traffic.  However, I have seen 101 and 127.

   3. Targetting restrictions -- what is your concerns here?  You can use wild
      card or you can also use one-to-one mapping.  It depends on how you 
      define them in the CMT tymfile.

   4. The patch ITT128.PAT has been incorported into the SOURCE patch 
      PBH07.P03.  Please remove the ITT128.PAT from your command file.

   5. According to PBH07.X03, 255 devices need 244K core memory.  We have 
      genned a PBH 7.03 here with 255 devices (combination of 1920 bytes 
      CRTs and Printers) of 127 simultaneous users and got 214K memory 
      requirement.

   6. I have seen configurations using CMT that have 50 CRTs and 50 PRTs
      defined in the PBH 7.03 and PBH 7.05 and up to 101 simultaneous users
      in macro HSTPRT.  But not 255 devices.

      TO BE A CUSTOMER-USABLE PRODUCT LIKE TOM?  ARE THE FEATURES IT ADVER-
      TIZES IN THE CMTI.ERS MANUAL GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED (THE ONLY THING I
      CAN GET TO WORK IS THE REAL-TIME RING TRACE), AND IN WHAT VERSION?

   2. WHAT IS THE CONDITION OF THE STATUS LINE FEATURE IN CMT? LAST TIME I 
      HEARD THERE WERE SOME PROBLEMS.  ALSO WHAT VERSION OF CODE IS IT 
      IMPLEMENTED IN?

   3. WHAT VERSION OF CODE IS THE TEMPUSLINK FILE TRANSFER OPTION IMPLEMENTED
      IN?  HOW DOES IT WORK AND HOW WELL DOES IT WORK?  WHO HAS TESTED IT?





RESPONSE:
 
1. COM.
   The purpose of COM is to help us monitor the activities of the rings
   and to help us in our debugging.  It is intended to be used by HQTECH,
   NTD, and even you when something needs to be monitored.  It is not
   intended for customer use like TOM.  This tool is implemented in
   version 3.00 and any new versions after.  All features advertised on
   the CMTI.ERS manual are implemented.  If you find anything not working
   the way it is advertised, please contact us.  Please be sure to test
   on version 3.00 when you are using COM and not 2.06.
 
2. Status line.
   Status line is implemented on version 3.00.  Currently, we have a few
   betatest customers running this version and are happy with it.  Any
   problems that were brought to our attention have been resolved by NTD.
   If you know of any problems that I don't know of, please let me know.
 
3. TEMPUSLINK file transfer.
   TEMPUSLINK is a package running on the PC and on the host application to
   allow file transfer to work.  There is a customer (CHRYSLER) which uses
   this package going through CMTI (2.06) with a 3101 emulation selection.
   Any versions after 2.06 would also support file transfer but only a few
   terminal emulation macros (eg. VT100M, CM3101) have this capability.

      Network Console, in Public Net, has been updated from version 2.07
   to 3.01 since April 23.  The command to exit XOM and get back to NTCN is 
   changed to "RETurn".  "DISconnect" is not a valid command for 3.01.

      There are tho methods of implementating nodecode with all SIO, and
   no sync, in an Isis environment:

      1. Use a dummy sync line definition for nodecode.  Specifically,
         set the NLINES to equate to 1, and use one S.REF statement
         for slot zero.

         This applies to full release status nodecode version 5.06 and
         limited release status nodecode version 5.07.

      2. Upgrade to betatest status nodecode version 5.10, which does
         require a betatest agreement.


      If the customer is a good candidate for betatesting, we would welcome 
   additional betatest sites.  I refer you to John Gomes, manager of HQ 
   Quality Assurance, for betatest agreements.

   NEW PATCHES ADDED TO THE (SOURCE)RAM.P07 FILE ARE:

   (1)  RAM can now process a five bit termination code. The termination
        code is contained in accounting message 14 subtype 0 message 
        type 0. The maximun vlue of the determination code is (26)d.  
        Before the implementation of the patch, RAM could only interprete
        a maximun determination code of (15)d.

   (2)  A patch has been added to correct the block count in the 
        EOF1 record. The block count is now being incremented at the
        time RAM is required to write a block of data to tape due to
        a time-out.  A time-out occurs approximately every 15 minutes.
        If the tape data is blocked, there may be an incomplete block
        that has to be written to tape.

   FCO RELEASE:

   Field Change Orders (FCOs) have been released to resolve the problem of a
   false single-bit parity error in MAC-II:

                     .FCO 85-462  CAS Timing Change
                     .FCO 85-418  ERO Change

   The above, are co-requisites; the pair must be installed.  Also, the 
   machine must be brought up to current revision level.


   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

   Due to a hardware timing problem, a memory fetch request results in a 
   "false" single-bit parity error and "false" data fetched.


   SYMPTOMS/DETECTION:

   The primary symptom is that a crash occurs due to an illegal instruction or
   illegal memory reference that is, in fact, NOT illegal.  Once, a dispatcher
   crash was caused by this problem.

   Supporting evidence is occurrence of the single-bit parity error a short 
   time before the crash - a few seconds - on chip numbers that are a multiple
   of 22:
                  .22, 44, 66, 88, 110, 132, 154 and 176.

   To determine existence of single-bit parity error:
      .Use DDT ?MEM for ISIS nodes
      .Use XRAY QE for SOLO nodes.

Written by : Shirley Chiang, Mgr. HQ Application's Support
      Date : May 14, 1986




      A total of 55 fields are identified from Bell Corp.'s "PPSN Generic
   Requirements - TA 00301" Appendix A, page A1 through A27.

      The purpose of this document is to provide the Tymnet counterparts,
   from the raw accounting data, for these 55 items.




 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


 1.  Call Type

     PVC indicator is used in X.25 but currently not being reported to
     Supervisor's accounting.  Latest news says it will be reported in
     version 3.02 of X.25 scheduled to be released in July, 86.

     PVC indicator is in Msg. type 14.15.00.ff, where ff=0001 as a flag.

 2.  Sensor Type

     We are not sure of the definition and therefore unable to give answers
     unless more explanations are provided.

     From here on, this type of situation will be marked as D.N.C. for
     Definition Not Clear.

 3.  Sensor Id.

     D.N.C.

 4.  Recording Office Type

     D.N.C.

 5.  Recording Office Id.

     D.N.C.

 6.  Connect Date

     (If this means the start date/time of a network login session:)

     = timestamp (GMT from 01/01/74 in seconds) on the block where Msg. 
       type 01 for a session is recorded.  The timestamp can be converted
       to create the standard MM/DD/YY HH:MM:SS format.

 7.  Timing Indicator

     Not directly reflected in raw accounting data.  May be obtained by
     analysing the start/termination time explained in Item #16 and 17.

 8.  Study Indicator

     N/A. (Not Applicable in Tymnet Accounting)

 9.  Originating Sensor Id.
   
     D.N.C.

10.  Terminating Sensor Id.

     D.N.C.

11.  Originating SR (service region)

     Tymnet Accounting provides the the node/host information of the origi-
     nation/destination point into/out the Network.  It does not capture
     the phone numbers of the private or public dial-up accesses unless:

      A.  if the dial-up number is entered after the password (in the login
          string) and treated as part of the project code, then it will
          be recorded in multiple Msg. type 13's;

      B.  in order for the project code to be reported, the destination host
          or host interface must do something special.  It must turn a flag
          on in ISIS segment "E", so the destination node will capture
          everything entered after the password up to 27 characters
          and ship it to the supervisor as accounting Msg. type 13's.
          Usually this is handled as a patch which may be incorperated
          or assembled into the code when project code is desired.  Con-
          sultation with Tymnet technical support shall be needed in search
          of such a patch for various interfaces.

     Orig. node is in Msg. type 2, bit 4 - 15,
     orig. host is in Msg. type 4.2, bit 16 -31,
     dest. node is in Msg. type 4.1, bit 16 -31,
     dest. host is in Msg. type 3, bit 12 - 20.

12.  Originating SA-EPN (service area-end point number)

     See Item #11.

13.  Terminating SR

     See Item #11.

14.  Terminating SA-EPN

     See Item #11.

15.  Network User Id.

     A. If this means the unique Tymnet invoice or session number:
   
        = Msg. type 01, bit 8 - 31, where bit 8 - 11 is prefixed by 
          Supervisor number as each Supervisor keeps its own set
          of numbers up to 20 bits long to assign to every logon session.
          In order to make the invoice/session number unique, the Supervisor
          number is then prefixed to the 20 bit sequential numbers.

     B.  If this means the user name:

        = multiple Msg. type 4.0, where each Msg. type 4.0 contains up to
          three characters of the user name string.

     C.  If this means the NUI in X.25:

        NUI will be part of the calling/called address and is dependent
        on how it is structured and specified in X.25.
        (Reference Tymnet X.25/X.75 Reference Manual, Chapter 2)
        (Also see Item #31, 32 for detail on calling/called address)

16.  Connect Time

     See item #6.

17.  Elapsed Time

     If this means the session duration time:

     = (termination GMT) - (start GMT), where termination GMT is the timestamp
     of the block when the last accounting message (could be type 9, 10, 11
     or 14) is recorded for the session.

     In Tymnet's own billing process, program will flag if the termination
     indicator (Msg. type 14) is received.  Otherwise, it will hold the
     last accounting message (for the session) for six hours as a graceful
     waiting period, and then uses the timestamp of that last accounting
     message as the termination time and artificially generates a termination
     code of 84.

18.  Charging & Packet Indicator

     Definition not clear for Packet Indicator.

     Charging Indicator as used in X.25:

     = Msg. type 14.0.7.nm, where nm is a two byte field,
       n = 0 for normal charge (i.e. charge to orig. DTE),
         = 1 for reverse charge (i.e. charge to terminating DTE),
       m = 0 for originating from host or FEP
         = 1 for originating from terminal or PAD.

       (X.25 defaults to reverse charge.)

19.  Termination Cause Indicator

     = Msg. type 10, 11 or 12, and/or msg. type 14.0.0.vv where
       vv is a 16 bit value ranging from 1 to 32 and providing
       a supplement to the termination reasons indicated in Msg.
       10, 11 or 12.

       Occasionally Msg. type 14.0.15.nm may be sent by X.25/X.75 as
       an additional supplement for more detailed termination causes,
       where n = call clear cause,
             m = diagonostic code.

20.  Rate Period 1 Segment Count

     Segment count or packet count is reported by X.25/X.75:

     = Msg. type 14.1 through 14.8.  May be reported by both the orig. 
       and destination interfaces.

     Tymnet internal billing normally uses orig. p/s count.  If orig.
     p/s count is not presented, then destination p/s count will be used.

     Rate period can be obtained by comparing the session elapsed time.

21.  Rate Period 2 Segment Count

     See Item #20.

22.  Rate Period 3 Segment Count

     See Item #20.

23.  Rate Period 4 Segment Count

     See Item #20.

24.  Originating Service Type

     Not directly reflected in raw accounting data.  Must read the orig.
     node/host and match with some kind of external table (of SWB's)
     to identify the type of service or application running within
     the origination point or terminal interface.

     Orig. node is in Msg. type 2, bit 4 - 15,
     orig. host is in Msg. type 4.2, bit 16 - 31.

25.  Terminating Service Type

     Similar process needed to identify the termination host or host
     interface.

     Termination or destination node is in Msg. type 4.1, bit 16 - 31,
     termination or destination host is in Msg. type 3, bit 12 - 20.

26.  Priority

     N/A.

27.  Segment Size

     If this means the segments generated by X.25 interface:

     not recorded in raw accounting data.  It is dynamically calcu-
     lated by X.25, some segments may carry more data, some less.
     In general, guess-timated average is around 22 characters per segment.

     Version 3.02 of X.25 will report this information as accounting
     addendum to the Supervisor.  Version 3.02 is scheduled to be released
     in July, 86.

     When it is implemented, this message will be reported only when
     Fast Select is requested;otherwise, no such message will even be
     seen in the raw accounting data.

     Multiple Msg. type 14.6.nm will be recorded for multiple transit
     network DNIC's.  However, one additional such message will also
     be recorded signaling the ending of the stream where:
       n = FF (a constant value in hex.),
       m = the total number of transit networks just previously being
           reported.

     If this means the interval of node reporting accounting addendum,
     then it is known to be 15 - 20 minutes and is a function of 
     Tymnet ISIS/Node Code.

47.  Count of Intrastate attempts

     Not directly reflected in raw data.  Must first go through external
     table process to identify the location or site of the orig. and
     dest. interfaces to determine whether the session is an intrastate
     or interstate one, then must sort out the sessions and verify 
     the termination reasons and analyse the patterns of the logins.
     This is strictly an application process utilizing the information
     provided by the raw data.

48.  Count Of Interstate Attempts
     
     See Item #47.

                     INFO ON HOW TO CORRECT THE SUP TIME

      The command used to correct the Superclock time is:   FTIME  and is of 
   the following format:    
     
             :FTIME n 
     
   where n is the number of seconds (in decimal), by which the Superclock time
   is to be changed.  
     
   To increase time by n (>0) seconds, issue
             :FTIME n                (:FTIME +n  does not work) 
     
   To decrease time by n (>0) seconds issue
             :FTIME -n
     
      The Superclock can be updated only when the GMT is of the form XXXXX000
   (an 8 digit hex. number).  Therefore this command may take anywhere from 
   1 sec to 1 hr 8 minutes.  An 'ESC' will abort the command.   
     
      The FTIME command only updates the Superclock, but in order for the 
   active Supervisor to reset its time, the ETIME command has to be used.

      ALL SUBSEQUENT ASSEMBLIES FOR BBXS CODE FOR VERSION 3.06, 5.02 AND
   6.01 MUST INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT IN THEIR TYMFILES FOR TIF AND 
   HIF.

   OPTION(ACCOUNT,12345)      :FIVE DIGIT ACCOUNTING HOST #


      THE SYMBOL "ACCOUNT" WILL NOW BE USED TO SET THE ACCOUNTING HOST NUMBER
   IN PSEUDO-NEEDLE REQUESTS FOR ALL TERMINAL I/F LINES.

      EXISTING TERMINAL INTERFACE SLOTS NEED NOT BE TAKEN DOWN IF THE NUMBERS
   PREVIOUSLY GENERATED BY THE "LOCATION" MACRO HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED TO THE SLOT
   WHICH GENERATED THEM.  NIB FILES FOR THOSE EXISTING SLOTS NEED NOT BE 
   RE-ASSEMBLED UNTIL THE SLOT'S CONFIGURATION IS CHANGED.

      HOST INTERFACE LINES WILL CONTINUE TO USE THE NETWORK HOST NUMBER AS THE
   ORIGINATING HOST NUMBER FOR ALL HOST-ORIGINATED CALLS.

      The following "Ring Decoding Guide", is very helpful for all of us who
   are supporting RJE products for 5.02 and above.  Currently there is no
   documentation available on this subject, which can help us decode the 
   Rings.

      I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Eric Buell who helped me
   obtain the following information.

            TWO NEW USER-WRITTEN SUBROUTINES IN FOCUS VERSION 5.0

   Have you ever wanted to prompt a user for a field in the database but
   there were multiple spellings possible and the user needed to know the  
   correct spelling in order to retrieve the record?
 
   There is finally an answer in Focus 5.0 . . . A new subroutine called:
 
                                   SOUNDEX
   Try it ... You'll like it ...
    
   The calling sequence is:
    
               SOUNDEX(NUMCHAR,INPUT,OUTPUT)
    
   Where:  NUMCHAR    (alpha)   Two character field containing the length
                                of the input field.
    
           INPUT      (alpha)   Input alpha field of length NUMCHAR.
    
           OUTPUT     (alpha)   Four character output.
   
   NOTE:  If NUMCHAR is not between 1 and 99 then '****' is returned
          in OUTPUT.
 
   SOUNDEX can be used for phoenetic ("sounds like") searches, for
   example in surname searches.  The algorithm retains the first
   character of INPUT and assigns a digit to represent each of the
   next 3 'significant' sounds (determined by the algorithm).
 
   Example:
 
        cms type soundex focexec
 
        -PROMPT &SOUND.A10.ENTER APPROXIMATE COUNTRY NAME.
        -SET &SOUND=EDIT(&SOUND ^^ '          ','9999999999');
        DEFINE FILE CAR
        TESTSOUND/A4 WITH COUNTRY=SOUNDEX('10','&SOUND^',TESTSOUND);
        COUSOUND/A4=SOUNDEX('10',COUNTRY,COUSOUND);
        TEST/I1=IF COUSOUND EQ TESTSOUND THEN 1 ELSE 0;
        END
        TABLE FILE CAR
        PRINT COUNTRY COUSOUND TESTSOUND TEST
        END
 
        ex soundex
        ENTER APPROXIMATE COUNTRY NAME
 
        italli
        >
 


        COUNTRY     COUSOUND  TESTSOUND  TEST
        -------     --------  ---------  ----
 
        ENGLAND     E524      I340          0
        JAPAN       J150      I340          0
        ITALY       I340      I340          1   <=== NOTE THE 'MATCH'
        W GERMANY   W265      I340          0
        FRANCE      F652      I340          0
 
 
   There is a second new user subroutine available in release 5.0 of Focus.
   The subroutine called UPCASE will translate all lower case characters
   in a Dialogue Manager variable or in a field into their upper case
   equivalent.
 
   The calling sequence is:
 
               UPCASE(NUMCHAR,INPUT,OUTPUT)
    
   Where:   NUMCHAR    (numeric)   The number of characters in the field
                                   INPUT.
 
            INPUT      (alpha)     The input character string of length
 
            OUTPUT     (alpha)     The resultant character string of length
                                   NUMCHAR with lower case letters
                                   translated to upper case
 
   Note:  If NUMCHAR is less than or equal to zero, blanks are returned
   in OUTPUT.
 
   This routine can be expecially useful when using CRTFORM LOWER for
   data entry where not all fields are to be retained in lower case
   such as the key fields.
 
   Example:
 
        cms type upcase focexec
 
        -SET &TEXT = '123456789012345678901234567';
        -CRTFORM LOWER
        -"ENTER TEXT BELOW:
        -"<&TEXT>"
        -TYPE YOU HAVE INPUT THE FOLLOWING TEXT:  &TEXT
        -SET &UPTEXT=UPCASE(27,&TEXT,'A27');
        -TYPE  IN UPPER CASE, IT IS:   &UPTEXT
 
        >
        ex upcase
        YOU HAVE INPUT THE FOLLOWING:  qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm 1234567890
        IN UPPER CASE, IT IS:          QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM 1234567890
        >
 
   If you have any trouble with either of these new user-written subroutines
   please send an Ontyme to ACS.FOCUS.

      Detailed configuration information is often required to integrate the 
   hardware and software during the staging process. There are often several 
   alternative configuration choices for any one issue. NSSU will not presume
   to know the customer's expectations. Therefore, when a configuration 
   question arises in the staging process which is judged to be significant, 
   the staging process may be suspended or rescheduled pending clarification 
   of the configuration discrepancy.
     
     
                   CONFIGURATION  CONCERNS
     
      The following information must be obviously apparent to the staging 
   staff by default or by information previously provided by the technical 
   staff of the order originator:
     
     
           1. Connector panel connectivity   
     
           2. Cluster interconnectivity - Board and card addressing   
                                          and interconnectivity   
     
           3. LAN configuration    
     
           4. Target code TYMFILE, CMD, and BND file locations   
     
           5. Target code TYMFILE reconciliation to the hardware 
              configuration 
     
           6. Any place a decision is needed which will affect the    
              installation process at the customer site   
     
     
      The above information is required at the time the equipment is released
   from manufacturing to NSSU. NSSU will not preview orders for technical 
   integrity. When information is needed, staging will continue as possible 
   until the answers are provided. Some delay is probable.  
     
     
                   PROCEDURE - DISCREPANCY CORRECTION AND TRACKING 
     
           The process will be as follows for each incident:
     
           1. The NSSU stager will add a mail message to the order in 
              question addressed to the following people if they are
              identified in the OES order:  TYMNET Technical Contact,    
              Salesperson, TYMNET Order Coordinator  
     
           2. The OES mail message will identify the discrepancy or question    
              in detail
     
           3. The OES mail message will estimate (from NSSU's perspective) the  
              probable delay in days or weeks, which will usually be
              cumulative to the response time of the query.    
     
           4. The OES order coordinator will reschedule the staging commit 
              date and subsequent ship date.    
        
           5. Phone conversation between principles is encouraged, however,
              corrective action will only commence upon receipt of the   
              authorizing mail message from the OES order coordinator.   
     
     
                   SMART ORDERING - DISCREPANCY PREVENTION    
     
      A means to insure that NSSU has all the needed information to prevent 
   delays in staging is to complete and deliver one of the following forms 
   to NSSU prior to the equipment arriving in staging.  The forms are located
   in NSSU directory on systems 28 and 56. Each form identifies the location 
   of the sunpporting document and related forms.
     
           The file names are:
     
           SECONF.FRM      for stand-alone ENGINES with PSM buckets   
     
           PSCONF.FRM      for Port Switched clusters  
     
           MPCONF.FRM      for MPX cluster systems

      THIS ONTYME IS AN INFORMATIONAL GUIDELINE AS TO HOW BACKUP REQUESTS AND 
   PUBLIC NETWORK CODE ISSUES ARE HANDLED IN PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION.  THERE 
   HAVE BEEN SOME SLIGHT REVISIONS TO THE BACKUP REQUEST PROCEDURES.  PLEASE
   NOTE THE FOLLOWING TOPICS OF INTEREST THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED:


   I.   BACKUP REQUESTS

   II.  BACKUP REQUEST PROCEDURES - INTERNAL

   III. CODE ISSUES - SHORT TERM

   IV.  CODE ISSUES - LONG TERM


      IT IS IN PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION'S BEST INTEREST TO ENSURE CUSTOMER 
   SATISFACTION AS WELL AS INTERNAL COMPLIANCE.  WE ARE INTERESTED IN ANY 
   PROBLEMS YOU MAY BE EXPERIENCING SO THAT WE CAN TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS TO
   ALLEVIATE THEM IN THE FUTURE.  PLEASE FORWARD ANY COMMENTS OR SUGGESTIONS 
   TO ME DIRECTLY.  I CAN BE REACHED AT (408)942-5180, TYMOPS.B/AGUA, IN 
   NETWORK OPERATIONS, SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA.

   THANK YOU




I.  BACKUP REQUESTS
    ______ ________

    A.  BACKUP REQUESTS ARE FOR SLOT CODE ONLY UNLESS ONE OF THE FOLLOWING
        SITUATIONS OCCUR:

        1.  THE REQUEST IS FOR A LAB MACHINE.

        2.  PRIOR APPROVAL HAS BEEN GIVEN BY THE MANAGER OF PROJECT 
            IMPLEMENTATION TO BACKUP PUBLIC NETWORK NODE CODE.


    B.  THERE IS AN EXEC PROGRAM AVAILABLE VIA ONTYME TO SUBMIT A BACKUP
        REQUEST.  TO ACCESS THE PROGRAM, TYPE THE FOLLOWING COMMAND:

        EXEC *** FORMS.BACKUP

        THIS FILE HAS BEEN VALIDATED ON ALL INTERNAL HOSTS.  PLEASE COMPLETE
        FULLY AND ACCURATELY.  IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE CKSUMS ARE INCLUDED
        AS REQUESTED PER THE FORMAT.  ALL BACKUP REQUESTS ARE THEN SENT TO 
        THE ONTYME ID, TYMOPS.BACKUP.

    C.  SLOT CODE WILL ONLY BE BACKED UP FROM THE FOLLOWING REGIONAL 
        DIRECTORIES:

        WATECH   -   WESTERN REGIONAL DIRECTORY
        CENTCODE -   CENTRAL REGIONAL DIRECTORY
        METTECH  -   EASTERN REGIONAL DIRECTORY
        INTLTECH -   EXTERNAL NETWORK SERVICES
        PNTS     -   PRIVATE NETWORK GATEWAYS
        PACTECH  -   PACIFIC RIM DIRECTORY
        TMCSCODE -   NETWORK QUALITY CONTROL

    D.  CODE FOR NODES BELOW 5000 IS AVAILABLE ON SYSTEM 25 (PRIMARY) AND
        70 (SECONDARY).  CODE FOR NODE 5000 AND ABOVE IS LOCATED ON
        SYSTEM 54 (PRIMARY) AND 33 (SECONDARY).  SLOT CODE WILL ONLY 
        BE BACKED UP FROM THE DESIGNATED PRIMARY SYSTEM (25 OR 54).  BACK-
        UPS WILL ONLY BE ACCEPTED FROM THE SECONDARY SYSTEM (70 OR 33)
        IF THE PRIMARY SYSTEMS ARE DOWN.

    E.  ALL BACKUP REQUESTS WILL BE COMPLETED BY 12 NOON THE SAME DAY THE
        ONTYME IS RECEIVED.  THE SAME AFTERNOON, A BACKUP SUMMARY REPORT
        IS RELEASED STATING THE STATUS OF ALL BACKUP REQUESTS RECEIVED 
        THAT MORNING.  IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT THE FIELD MONITOR
        THIS REPORT TO ENSURE BACKUP REQUEST COMPLETION.  THERE MAY
        BE SOME DELAYS DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND OUR CONTROL, i.e., 
        host out of ports, system down, THUS INHIBITING OUR TIME FACTORS.

    F.  A BATCH REQUEST IS SENT THE SAME EVENING TO TAPE ALL FILES WORKED
        ON THAT SAME DAY TO THE SECONDARY SYSTEMS VIA FEDERAL EXPRESS.


II.  BACKUP REQUEST PROCEDURES - INTERNAL
     ------ ------- ----------

     A.  ONTYMES FOR THE USERNAME TYMOPS.BACKUP ARE PULLED ROUTINELY, FIRST
         THING EVERY MORNING.  THE BACKUP REQUESTS RECEIVED ARE THEN DISTRI-
         BUTED AMONGST THE INSTALLATION COORDINATORS IN PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION.
         PLEASE NOTE THAT BACKUPS ARE ONLY PULLED ONCE EACH DAY.

     B.  THE CKSUMS ON THE BACKUP REQUEST ARE COMPARED TO THE CURRENT CKSUMS
         IN THE DESIGNATED REGIONAL DIRECTORY.  REQUESTS MAY BE REJECTED AT
         THIS POINT FOR ONE OF THE FOLLOWING REASONS:

         1.  THE CKSUMS ON THE BACKUP REQUEST DO NOT MATCH THE CURRENT 
             CKSUMS IN THE DESIGNATED REGIONAL DIRECTORY.

         2.  NO FILES WERE FOUND IN THE DESIGNATED DIRECTORY/SYSTEM.

         3.  THE SLOT REQUESTED TO BE BACKED UP EXCEEDS THE SLOT CORE ALLOCA-
             TION ON THE TYMFILE AND THERE IS NO ROOM FOR EXPANSION.

     C.  A DIRECTORY OF THE NODE TO BE BACKED UP IS DONE FOR (2) CHECKS:

         1.  THERE MAY BE A TEMPORARY FILE AVAILABLE.  THIS WOULD SIGNAL
             A PENDING PROJECT REQUIRING SPECIAL TREATMENT.
 
         2.  WHICH FILES NEED TO BE DELETED  TO ACCOMODATE THE NEW INCOMING
             FILES.

     D.  THE SLOT CODE IS THEN RENAMED FROM THE DESIGNATED REGIONAL DIRECTORY
         TO THE TYMNET OR TYM5 DIRECTORY.

     E.  A NEW BND FILE IS CREATED USING THE MERLIN PROGRAM.  THIS NEW BND
         FILE INCLUDES ALL OF THE MOST CURRENT SLOT CODE IN THE TYMNET OR
         TYM5 DIRECTORY.

     F.  THE NEW FILE IS THEN DECLARED "ALL READ READ".  THE CODE CAN NOW
         BE ACCESSED BY ALL USERS.


III.CODE ISSUES - SHORT TERM
    ---- ------   ----- ----

    A.  A CODE GENERATOR IS AVAILABLE ON A (24) HOUR BASIS SIMPLY BY
        CONTACTING NETWORK CONTROL.  NETWORK CONTROL WILL THEN 'BEEP' THE 
        CODE GENERATOR ON-CALL.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THE CODE GENERATOR IS ONLY
        RESPONSIBLE FOR PUBLIC NETWORK NODE CODE.

    B.  SHORT TERM CODE ISSUES SHOULD BE SUBMITTED VIA ONTYME TO THE MANAGER
        OF PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION.  AS A RESULT, THE CODE WILL BE CORRECTED
        WITHIN (24) HOURS AND LOADED THE FOLLOWING EVENING.  EITHER A VERBAL
        PHONE CALL OR WRITTEN RESPONSE WILL BE SENT BACK TO THE CONCERNED
        INDIVIDUAL WITHIN (48) HOURS, CONFIRMING THAT WE HAVE COMPLETED
        THEIR REQUEST.

    C.  IN URGENT SITUATIONS (CUSTOMER OUT OF NET), A PHONE CALL WILL SUFFICE,
        FOLLOWED BY AN ONTYME.  THE CODE IS CORRECTED IMMEDIATELY AND LOADED

    ON MAY 30TH 1986, THE QUALITY ASSURANCE ORGANIZATION WILL TAKE OVER
    SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTION FROM NTD.  THE NEW PROCEDURE FOR THIS PROCESS
    IS ATTACHED FOR YOUR REFERENCE.


    TYPES OF DIRECTORIES

    Software  products  will  be  submitted from the  NTD  Beta  Test 
    directory  into the  QA Beta Test  Directory.  See  the following
    figure:


            |--------------|    |     |-------------|
            |     NTD      |    |     |    *QA      |

                                      |-------------|
    
         * = Note - All products contained in the NTD beta test
         directory will not neccessarily be contained in the
         QA beta test directory.  QA has the right to selectively
         place products in this directory.
    
    
    NAMING CONVENTION FOR VERSION NUMBERS FOR ALL DIRECTORIES
    
    The  procedure for version numbers will be as  follows:
    
         - Beta Test Products will begin with x.x1.
           (For example - 2.01)
    
         - Beta Test Products will increment by one when a new
           release is submitted.
           (For example - 2.01 to 2.99) (A PIR has been submitted to
           change the numbering scheme in ISIS from octal to decimal)
    
         - Once the beta test product is approved for limited release
           it will retain the same version number. 
           
    
    
    PATCHES
 
    Patches  will  only  be made to products which are in  a  release 
    state.  Only  patches which have a Network Software Report  (NSR) 
    and which are tested will be entered in the QA Source  Directory.   
    (Note - For beta test products a new version will be submitted to 
    QA.   Exception - If the customer is down or unable to adequately 
    use the product a patch will be accepted with an approved NSR.)
    
    NUMBER OF RELEASES
    
    There  will only be 1 beta test version of a product at  any  one 
    time. (Note - Customers must upgrade to latest beta test version. 
    Exception  - Customer may use existing version,  but must upgrade 
    if  a  re-gen or bug fix is needed.)   Once approved for  limited 
    release  (Length  of beta test will be approximately  90  days.),  
    the product will be transferred to the source directory, where it 
    will reside until replaced.  When the next version enters limited 
    release,  the  old  full released version will be deleted  in  18 
    months and will no longer be supported.
    
    RELEASE NOTICES
    
    All  product  release notices will be submitted by  NTD  Baseline 
    Distribution  to Quality Assurance.   All release notices against 
    products  in  limited  and full release will  be  distributed  by 
    Quality Assurance to *** alltech.  Beta Test release notices will 
    be  distributed  by Quality Assurance to the  Regional  Technical 
    Managers.   It will be responsibility of the RTMs to notify their 
    staff  of new beta test releases for customer  upgrade  purposes.  
    The format for the release notices will be similar to NTDs.   The 
    exception  will  be the change of the NTD contact to a  Technical 
    Services or Quality Assurance representative.  

    MONITORING OF PRODUCTS 
    
    The QA Manager will monitor the beta test  reports to assure that 
    products move in a reasonable amount of time from beta to source.  
    QA  will  obtain  the  anticipated release  dates  from  NTD  for 
    scheduling  purposes.  QA will review pertinent test results  and 
    will  consult  with  Technical Services,  Marketing and  NTD  for 
    approval  for  limited  release.  Products which are  in  limited 
    release  will  be  considered  for  full  release  by  the  above 
    departments  in  approximately 90 days.   QA will  be  the  final 
    release authority for all products.

      Network Console version 3.01, in public network, displays "login error:
   25 (or 26 or 27)" instead of a host not available message when an accssed
   XOM host does not exist in the network.  This is caused by a mis-matched 
   I/O parameter in Network Console 3.01 and Pascal Nucleus 11.12.  Before
   the new version is released, please bear in mind the "login error: #" 
   message stands for "Host not available thru net".

      The memory needed for 5.06 nodecode for a Tymnet-II, ISIS machine, in
   decimal kilobytes, is as follows:

   108 +
   if ZITEL specified then 1 +
   2 * SILINS +                       (2K per SIO line)
   .11 * NSLOT +
   .4 * (NLUS0-SILINS) +              (.4K per sync line)
   x * NDP +                          (x = .26 (REBILD) or .1 (not REBILD))
   y * NPTHR +                        (y = .35 (REBILD) or .26 (not REBILD))
   .21 * NXUBLK +                     (# XRAY users - default = 3)
   3.75 * XLINKS +
   sum(memory requirements for all TIILNKS)
   KB.

   The memory requirement for a TIILNK = 1.55 + (.271 * windowsize).

      I figured this formula out by playing around with the TYMFILE, trying
   100's of different configurations, and also by checking the listing of 
   nodecode to make sure the parameters were relatively independent.  Still, 
   this formula seems to predict a little high - as much as 10% over.  So be 
   advised.

ORIGINAL QUESTION:

   Usually the right most (2) digits of a front panel indicate the number of
   circuits terminated on that node, plus the number of passthroughs currently
   through that node.  The micro, however, sometimes shows 'FE' or 'FC' alter-
   nately, but actually not that many circuits are within the node.  Does
   the node code use the last 2 digits for some other purpose?  Any special
   meaning by the 'FE' and/or 'FC' being displayed?



RESPONSE:

   The right-hand 2 digits of the micro, when the front panel is displaying 
   information for slot 0, displays the righthand 2 digits of the number of 
   active ports.  This number is computed by nodecode (slot 0).  It is 
   increased every time a needle or pseudo-needle is received, and decreased 
   by 1 when a zapper is received.

   HOWEVER IT IS NOT ENTIRELY ACCURATE.

   Due to login race conditions, this number can become inaccurate - i.e. 
   become too big or too small.  In your case, it went negative - 'FE' = -2 
   and 'FC' = -4.

   When you do  a 'ND' in XRAY, this number will be accurately computed.    
   Next time you see this happen, go into XRAY and do an 'ND' and observe 
   the righthand 2 digits of the console change to a more reasonable number.

   I assume that you know, of course, that the front panel can display 
   information on other slots - by pressing DATA <slot#> RUN.  These other 
   slots can display whatever they want in the front panel - however, you will
   not see the distinctive slot 0 display , where you have a 3-second display,
   then a 1-second display alternating.

ORIGINAL QUESTION:

   I have received a request that a backup disc be created for my cusotmer's
   TMCS node.  I need to know how to proceed with this process.  By loading
   the node via PDP-10 onto a formated disc pack, I am concerned about losing
   TMCS history buffers, as well as, user profiles.  How can we retain all the
   information that is located on the production disc pack?



RESPONSE:

   The following is the procedure to archive disk files to tape.  In this
   procedures, use the first value of the DTAPE parameter of the TMCS slot 
   tymfile as the value of tape unit #:

       o  Insert a write ring in a scratch tape
       o  Mount the scratch tape on an available TMCS unit
       o  Log into TMCS
       o  At the * prompt enter

                 ARCHIVE STORE {tape unit #}

       The name of each file will be displayed beofe it is stored; example:

       PROFILE STORED
       HOST NAME STORED
       HOST LOCATION STORED
       NODE NAME STORED
       PROBE STORED

        (etc)

       o  Remove the write ring from the tape and remount
       o  At the * prompt enter

                 ARCHIVE DIRECTORY {tape unit #}

   The files stored on the tape will display in the following format:

       TAPEPOS   MM/DD/YY   HH:MM:SS    FILENAME    SIZE

       o  Remove the tape from the drive and store it


   If TMCS seems to be working improperly due to a possible disk problem

       o  Take out the disk pack
       o  Insert a test pack
       o  Load disk diagnostics
       o  Restore the disk pack belonging to TMCS

   Adjust the hardware according to the diagnostics.  If there was nothing
   wrong with the controller, reformat the TMCS disk.

   To restore the stored data perform the following:

       o  Reload TMDM using the configuration existing at the time of the
          last archive store

       o  Initialize the disk

       o  Reload TMCS also using the same configuration at the time of the 
          last archive store

       o  Remount the archived tape

       o  Log into TMCS


       At the * prompt, execute:

                 ARCHIVE RESTORE {tape unit #}

       o  Halt and execute the TMCS slot

   The procedure is complete.

       RECOVERY AFTER TERMINAL GOES DOWN (MIDWAY THROUGH TRANSMISSION)

Written by : John Burrough, HQ Network Staff Consultant
      Date : June 05, 1986



   
ORIGINAL QUESTIONS:

   Host sends data to HIF--HIF acknowledges it--sends it on to TIF, but then 
   the terminal goes down and doesn't get all the data.  What happens?



RESPONSE:

   If the terminal comes back up within 12 minutes, nothing at all.  The user
   can keep going with his application.  Any data that was queued up for the 
   terminal when it went down, will be sent to the terminal.

   After 12 minutes, the TIF will perform a cleanup operation, deleting any
   data bound for that terminal.  If the terminal comes up after the 12 
   minutes, any data queued for the terminal will be lost;  however, the user
   can type <something> TRANSMIT and the application should respond.

   Note that, just because a terminal goes down, its circuit is NOT zapped.  
   (Exception: if ALL the terminals on a line go down, i.e. stop responding to
   polls, when we finally give up trying to poll them we WILL zap all the 
   circuits on that line.)

      The default setting for inactivity is no hang.  The number of minutes
    of inactivity, to elapse before a user is to be dropped, must be specified
    with the 'inact' option.  This option may be set at the global, host, or
    subhost level.  In the case of an async outdial tymcom, this option would
    be set at the host level.  Project Implementation would not be responsible
    for this customer's portion of the code since addition of an inactivity
    timer would fall inter the non-standard configuration category.  A
    Communications Consultant would be responsible for submitting the revision
    to Project Implementation.  The procedure is as follows:

    Non-Standard Configurations
    ---------------------------

    Communications Consultants shall be responsible for configuration of 
    individual customer's portion of the Outdial slot Tymfile and for updating
    the "REVISION HISTORY".

    1.  The Communication Consultant may configure the individual customer's
        portion of the Outdial interface in any way he deems appropriate so
        long as it may be affected at the host, subhost, or port level.
   
    2.  The Communication Consultant may NOT alter the hardware, TOM, or
        global level configuration of the Outdial interface.

    3.  The Communication Consultant MUST provide Project Implementation with
        the appropriate individual customer host portion of the Outdial slot
        Tymfile 72 hours before the scheduled installation.  Project 
        Implementation shall be responsible for code generation and install-
        ation of the slot code.

    Complications in communicating with the called device after the slot has
    been succesfully loaded, shall be the responsibilty of the Communication
    Consultant (responsible to the customer account being installed) to
    resolve using the resources of a Communication Consultant local to the
    Outdial slot.  Under NO circumstances shall Project Implementation be
    contacted to troubleshoot the Outdial slot code after the slot has been 
    successfully loaded.  Project Implementation must be notified of any 
    subsequent changes made to the original Outdial slot code by Communication
    Consultants.

    ----------------------------

    NOTE : This memo refers to the async outdial offering, utilizing the async
           Tymcom code.  It does not refer to other outdial offerings.

ORIGINAL QUESTION:

   How can the Inactivity Timer be overriden by the Application ID field,
   in the DSP logon string?



RESPONSE:

   The answer to you question is explained in the SNA ERS manual.
 
   In essence, SNA HIF has the feature of allowing users to eliminate the 
   sysgen defined Inactivity Time-out value during logon to the the HIF.  If 
   the graphic character representing the Application ID (line No.) is in the
   range of 50-5F, the user will have a Class 2 status and the originally 
   defined ITIMOUT is reset to 0.

ANSWER:

   Each session requires 112 bytes of memory.  Using our lab version and the
   code generated I calculated the value to be 6,959.  However the calculation
   must have been a little off.  Once I tried to gen with this value RAM 
   displayed a message giving the maximun value to be 6,838.

   The restriction on this parameter will be governed by your availability of
   core for RAM.

   What happens when data is lost between HIF and TIF?

   Error correction is done locally, between the HIF and the host, and between
   the TIF and the UTS stations connected to it.  So the HIF/TIF only sends
   what it thinks is error-free data.

   The TIF and HIF are essentially independent from one another.  The way that
   the HIF/TIF will detect a data loss problem at the other end or in an 
   intermediate node will be the reciept of an ISIS message - Black Ball or 
   Zap.

   If data is lost in the network, a Black Ball is sent (i.e. replaces lost 
   data) in the same direction as the original data.

   If the TIF receives a Black Ball, it:
        - sends "NETWORK CIRCUIT LOST" to the appropriate terminal.
        - zaps circuit.

   In Early Data Forwarding, 1 large message coming into the HIF can be split
   into smaller, self-contained, correctly formatted Univac messages and 
   shipped off before the entire mainframe message has been received.
   Therefore, you can have the situation where part of the EDF'ed message gets
   received properly by the TIF (and sent -> terminal), but the rest of the 
   mainframe message is lost.

   If the HIF receives a Black Ball, it will clear table entries related to 
   the device associated with theis circuit - freeing buffers queued to this 
   device, etc.

   If the circuit gets zapped:

        SVC - user must redial
        PVC - Circuit automatically rebuilds.  User will detect problem in
              this case by a pause and "NETWORK CIRCUIT LOST" on the screen.

      Although it is still in limited release, there is a known bug in
   v.41.04 which can cause future problems, yet be easily avoided.  The 
   DEFNOD statement generally is of the format:

   DEFNOD ((NTYP,ADR,NUM),(NTYP,ADR,NUM),(NTYP,ADR,NUM))

   Normally, one would fill in the type of node (NTYP=BASE,REMOTE, or TII),
   the maximum node number (ADR) for that type, and the expected node count
   (NUM) of that type.  A typical statement might be:

   DEFNOD ((BASE,11,2),(REMOTE,1001,1),(TII,3000,200))

   In this particular version of code, the filling of the ADR parameters in 
   the BASE and REMOTE definitions causes the unusual problem of allowing a 
   network operator to shut lines (ESHUT), but not unshut (RSHUT) them again.

   So, for version 41.04 the ADR parameters must be allowed to default in the
   BASE and REMOTE definitions as follows:

   DEFNOD ((BASE,,2),(REMOTE,,1),(TII,3000,200))

   Of course, if you have no Tymnet I Bases (i.e. you have upgraded all your 
   gateways to TII) and you have no TI Remotes, then these definitions may be
   omitted:

   DEFNOD ((TII,3000,200))

   I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ALL SALES PERSONS, FIELD REPS AND CC'S WHO INTERACT
   WITH CUSTOMERS, AWARE OF THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION CONCERNING CERTIFIED 
   PRODUCTS USING CMT.

   WHEN A PRODUCT IS TESTED AND CERTIFIED, THE QA CERTIFICATIONS GROUP IS 
   RESPONSIBLE FOR WRITING A CERTIFICATION DOCUMENT THAT DEFINES EXACTLY
   WHAT IS CERTIFIED AND ANY PECULIARITIES OR PROBLEMS RELATED TO A PRODUCT.
   NOT ALL THE FEATURES OF A PRODUCT ARE NECESSARILY CERTIFIED.  WE CERIFIY 
   ONLY THE SPECIFIC FEATURE THAT IS REQUESTED WHEN WE RECEIVE THE PRODUCT 
   FROM PRODUCT MARKETING.

   FOR EXAMPLE, A SOFTWARE PACKAGE MAY EMULATE SEVERAL TERMINAL TYPES, BUT WE 
   MAY ONLY BE REQUIRED TO CERTIFY TWO OF THEM.  ANOTHER EXAMPLE MAY BE THAT
   THE VT100 EMULATION MAY INTERACT PERFECTLY WELL WITH CMT, BUT THE EMULATION
   IN THE SOFTWARE CAN NOT HANDLE PRINTER SUPPORT.  SOME OF THESE PACKAGES MAY
   OFFER FILE TRANSFER CAPABILITIES THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO TEST.
   AS A RESULT, A PRODUCT THAT APPEARS ON OUR CERTIFIED PRODUCTS LIST, MAY
   BE ONLY PARTIALLY CERIFIIED, OR SOME PARTICULAR FUNCTIONS MAY NOT WORK,
   I.E.PRINTER SUPPORT.

   WHEN RECOMMENDING A PRODUCT TO A CUSTOMER, PLEASE LOOK AT THESE DOCUMENTS
   AND MAKE YOUR CUSTOMER AWARE OF EXACTLY WHAT CAN BE EXPECTED WHEN USING THE
   PRODUCT WITH TYMNET.  I'M SURE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT
   COULD ARISE FROM NOT CHECKING THESE THINGS OUT.

   I FEEL THAT SOME OF YOU MAY NOT BE AWARE THAT THESE DOCUMENTS EXIST.  IF
   YOU NEED TO SEE ONE OF THE DOCUMENTS WE HAVE WRITTEN, CONTACT DON PARKMAN
   OR DIRK HEARTMEN IN PRODUCT MARKETING, AS I DO NOT KEEP THESE FILES ON-
   LINE.

   HOPE THIS HELPS YOU IN THE FUTURE.

   I.   Types of certifications
 
        A. Third Party Software
           1. terminal emulations
           2. file transfer
 
        B. Terminal which emulates another terminal for which a
           macro has already been developed.
 
   II.  The certification must be approved for field testing
        by contacting Dirk Heartman in Product Marketing.  His
        Ontyme name is NSMS.D/HEARTMAN.
 
   III. Contact Mary Arnett in Quality Assurance and provide 
        the following information. Ontyme QSATS.M/ARNETT.
 
        A. The name of the product to be tested.
        B. Information on the type of testing to be done (See
           Section I), including the type of terminal(s) emulated.
 
   IV.  If the terminal emulated is not one provided for in our CMT
        demo facility, or if file transfer requires that some other
        host than Fremont be targeted, a special slot will have to
        be provided for the testing.
 
   V.   The field person doing the testing must obtain the Certifi-
        cation Procedures Document from Quality Assurance, the
        CMTERM.ERS manual, and the document for the product being
        tested.
 
   VI.  Using the procedure described in the product document, set
        up the terminal emulation with the features defined in the
        CMTERM.ERS manual under "Set Up".
    
   VII. At this point testing becomes a matter of following the
        procedures outlined in the Certification Procedures
        Document.
    
   VIII.Once the testing is complete, the results should be care-
        fully documented.  The exact configuration(s) tested 
        and any problems encountered should be described.  Also,
        any differences between the CMTERM.ERS documentation 
        and the product tested should be noted.  For example,
        the terminal emulated may support a printer, but the
        emulation of that terminal may not.  We would also like to 
        have the steps necessary to access the program.
 
   IX.  Once the documentation is complete, all of the information,
        and the software package or terminal should be sent to Quality
        Assurance for final test.
 
   X.   Quality Assurance will be responsible for the final test and
        documentation.
 
   XI.  The final documentation will be sent to Product Marketing
        by QA, and there it will be added to the list of certified
        products.

We've got two new capabilities coming out in July and we need more beta
test customers...

  Pooled Addressing for Printers

    Our Async-to-3270 Bisync Service now supports CRM 4 addressing.  This
    means that customers with printers no longer need unique usernames for
    every printer, i.e., one-to-one addressing is no longer a requirement.
    Users with attached printers will be able to share usernames.  This
    also means significant reductions in memory requirements when alot of
    printers need to be supported.

    (Note: this capability is supported by our 3270 Bisync HIF ONLY.  CRM 4
    SNA/SDLC support is targetted for the end of the year in beta test.)


  System Request Key

    This is an important capability for alot of Async-to-3270 SNA/SDLC 
    customers.  The Sys Req Key is a button on a 3270 that allows a user
    who is talking to an application (LU) on their host to switch to the
    System Services Control Point (SSCP).  The SSCP enables them to then
    login to other applications, i.e., it provides a multi-application
    access capability.



If you have a customer who wants to beta test either of these capabilities,
send an Ontyme to Mary Chalmers (NSMS.M/Chalmers) with the following info:

  1. Beta test suitability.  Does the customer have the resources, expertise,
     and commitment to be an effective beta test site?

  2. Customer Equipment.  What type of host hardware and system software
     (e.g., TSO, CICS, IMS) do they have?  What types of terminals, PCs,
     and printers?

  3. Tymnet support.  Can a CC be assigned with sufficient time and experience
     to conduct a productive test?  (contact your RTM)

  4. Target install date you would like.

   daily basis without serious problems.

   As of July 1, 1986, your customer will be able to obtain access to
   publicly shared X.PC Network Servers (host #4463) or order their own
   dedicated servers (with different host number), through the normal
   order entry process.  As with all full release products, product
   marketing approval is no longer required to process an X.PC order.

   There is no impact on your existing X.PC customers.

   You can retrieve any information regarding X.PC by typing "LIST ***
   XPC.ALL" on Ontyme.

   Thank you very much for your support of X.PC.
