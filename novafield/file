REV LEVEL:  3                                DATE CHANGED:  MARCH 21, 1991    

TYPE:  HARDWARE
HARDWARE:  CODEX 3340
SUBJECT:  STRAPPING & NETWORK MANAGEMENT INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE CODEX 3340.


===============================================================================

This CFB explains how to option the Codex 3340 modem and how to configure it
to work with the Network Management System as part of the Motorola Coverage
Plus project.

Starting in February 1991 the 3340 modem will be installed instead of the
Codex 2264, and somewhat later, the existing 2264 modems will be de-installed
and replaced with the 3340's.  This will be done because the 3340 modem is
capable of being managed from a central site Codex 9800 Network Management
System (that will be located at Motorola headquarters in Schaumberg, Ill.).

Both the standalone 3340 and the rack-mount 3340 (going into the Modulus 18
rack) will be optioned the same because the modems are basically identical.
CFB 183 gives information on how to set up the Modulus 18 Rack and tells how
to install the modems in the rack.



                             Codex 3340
                      Rear Panel Connections
                      ======================

On the back of the modem you will find two RS232 connectors labelled Port 1
and Port 2.  We will use only Port 1 for this project.  Port 2 could be used
if the MUX feature of the modem were turned on (but it is not).
There is one sub-miniature 25-pin connector labelled "NC" that is used for
the network management connection via a special Codex cable.  The network
management connections will be explained later in this CFB.

There are two RJ45 type connectors labelled "LL" and "DL".  The "LL" connector
is a "JM8" type and is the leased line connection on the modem.  Telco will
provide their leased line connection point on either an RJ11 connector or JM8
connector.  If telco provides an RJ11 use the special cable provided that has
a "JM8" connector on one end and the RJ11 connector on the other (this has
Tymnet Part Number 220091-001).  If telco provides a JM8 connector use the
Codex supplied JM8-to-JM8 cable in the modem shipping carton.  (Note:  On a
JM8 connector pins 1 & 2 are the transmit pair and pins 7 & 8 are the receive
pair).

The two-wire dial backup connection is to be connected to the jack marked
"DL".  For the Coverage Plus project regular 1MB dial lines are being ordered,
so regular RJ11-to-RJ11 cables are used for these dial backup lines.  The modem
is capable of using a programmable data jack RJ41, RJ45, or RJ36/RJ45 combina-
tion, but for this project only RJ11 dial backup connections are used.



                    Front Panel Description and Operation
                    =====================================

The front panel consists of eight LED's, four control buttons, and a sixteen
character display.

The eight LED's show the following information:
TD:  Transmit data is active
RD:  Receive data is active
RTS:  Local DTE is holding the RTS lead high, or it is optioned to be held
      high internally.
CD:  (Data Carrier Detect), the modem is receiving an acceptable signal from
     the remote modem.
NC:  (Network Control), when the LED is on solid the modem is under control
     of either the remote modem or a network management system.
     The NC LED flashes whenever it receives a command from either the network
     management system or from a remote modem talking to it on the NC channel.
AL:  (Alarm), if this LED is on solid red the modem is not receiving a signal,
     the signal quality is poor, or a modem failure has occured.  (Check the
     alphanumeric display).
     If the LED is flashing red it means the modem is in test mode.
FB:  (Fallback), if this LED is on solid yellow it means the modem is operating
     at some rate below it's full rated speed of 14.4KB.
DR:  (Dial Restoral), if this LED is on solid red it means the modem is
     operating on the dial backup line.

The LCD display gives sixteen digits concerning operational status modes,
strapping, and test status modes.


The four operating buttons will be named in this CFB as #1, #2, #3, & #4.
Button #1 (leftmost) looks like ascending stairs from right to left.
Button #2 (2nd from left) is three squares in a row.
Button #3 (2nd from right) is a circle with a plus sign in the center.
Button #4 (rightmost) is three concentric circles.

These four buttons are used to access the five main menus in the modem which
are:  STATUS, TEST, CONFIGURATION, DIAL, and AUXILIARY.  These five menus give
the following information:
STATUS:  Line quality, speed of operation, modulation method, network message,
         circuit operation quality (such as RCV level, Phase jitter, etc.),
         port status, EIA lead status, Address, Serial number and other
         information.
CONFIGURATION:  Optioning parameters for speed, carrier mode, error threshold,
         Transmit level, telco connection method, EIA lead treatment, multi-
         plexer port scheme, network management speed, network management
         address, automatic calling unit configuration, and other information.
DIAL:  Dial backup modes, dial backup error threshold, security, restore
         criteria, dial backup to leased line recovery time, dial backup tele-
         phone numbers, redial attempts, and other information.
AUXILIARY:  Password control, front panel contrast, front panel message,
         remote connection to far-end modem, assign remote address, search
         remote address, send message to remote modem, and other information.
TEST:  Loopback test capabilities, built-in bit error rate capabilities,
         1004 Hz tone generation, and test timeout periods.



         HOW TO USE BUTTONS #1 - #4 TO OPTION AND CONTROL THE MODEM
         ==========================================================

When you first power up the modem you see that the front panel goes blank for
approximately 14 seconds along with all eight LED's being lit, then the front
panel reads "ON-LINE TESTING" for about one second, then it displays the
default message "SQ>0 LEASED 9.6" (if it has been optioned according to
this CFB).
Now press button #1 and it will display "*STATUS".  Now by pressing #2 you can
jump to any of the five main menu selections listed above.  Once you have
selected the main menu group you press #1 to jump to any sub-group within that
main menu group.
Once you are in a sub-group you use #1 to access any unique selection within
that sub-group (whether it is options, test categories, etc.).
To cycle through the choice of selections within the sub-groups you use #3,
and when you have the right selection displayed on the front panel you press
#4 to activate it.  Once you have activated a new selection within a sub-group
the display will show an "equal sign" (=) to tell you that selection is now
made active.  If the display shows a "colon" (:) it means the selection has not
been made active, but could be made active by pressing #4.

                 ****** IMPORTANT NOTE ******
   The 3340 modems come from the factory with the PASSWORD feature enabled.
   This means that when you first try to do your strapping option changes it
   will come up with a message on the display saying "PROTECTED", then it will
   display "Enter PSWD 0000" (with a blinking cursor at the first zero).  Now
   you press #4 and the display will say "WELCOME" and you can now change any
   option in the modem because you have removed the protection.

Here are two examples:

Example A.
You have decided to change the leased line transmit level from "0 dB" to
"-1 dB".
Power the modem on and wait till it reads the default display on the panel.
Press #1 until it reads one of the five main menus (STATUS, TEST, CONFIGURA-
TION, DIAL, or AUXILIARY).
Press #2 until it reads "*CONFIGURATION".
Press #1 until it reads "CONFIG LEASE".
Press #2 until it reads "Tx Level= 0 dBm".
Press #3 until it reads "Tx Level: -1 dBm".
Press #4 once and it will read "Tx Level= -1 dBm".  (The equal sign means that
   this newly selected dBm value has been made the active choice).

Example B.
You have decided to run a REMOTE DIGITAL LOOPBACK test.
Power the modem on and wait till it reads the default display on the panel.
Press #1 until it reads one of the five main menus.
Press #2 until it reads "*TEST".
Press #1 until it reads "LOOP TESTS".
Press #2 until it reads "Rm DigLp=OFF".
Press #3 until it reads "Rm DigLp:P1".
Press #4 once and it will read "RM DigLp=P1".
The modem is now commanding the far-end modem to go into Remote Digital Loop-
back, and the local modem "AL" LED is blinking.

NOTE:  ANY CHANGE TO AN OPTION PARAMETER IS AUTOMATICALLY SAVED IN MEMORY.
       THIS MEANS THAT IT STAYS IN THE MODEM AFTER POWER IS TURNED OFF AND
       ON AGAIN.

To return to any of the five main menu groups from the selection screens within
the sub-groups you just press #1 until you reach a main menu.  Remember that
the five main menu group names have an asterisk (*) in front.

                   ***** IMPORTANT NOTE *****
   Plug the dial backup line into the modem jack marked "DL" before optioning
   the modem.  The reason for this is:  if the modem senses a leased line
   failure and tries to do a dial-backup connection when the dial-backup
   line is not plugged in, the modem goes into a strange state where all dial-
   backup attempts fail, but the leased line will still operate properly.
   This is a bug.  The way to clear this is to power cycle the modem.  Remember
   that power cycling the modem will not destroy the strap options.

   ***************** THIS COMPLETES THE OPTIONING OF THE MODEM ***************




                BRING UP THE 3340 ON THE LEASED LINE
                ====================================

Now that the 3340 is optioned correctly, plug the leased line RJ45 (JM8) into
the jack marked "LL" and plug the dial backup phone line RJ11 into the jack
marked "DL".  If the far-end modem is powered up and connected to the leased
line the two modems should handshake and come up on the line.

To check this, go to the "STATUS" main menu and use button #1 to show the first
status  screen which will show you the signal quality rating of the line.  If
it reads "SQ>9 LEASED 9.6" (or an SQ of 7 or 8) it means the leased line is up
and the two modems are talking successfully.
The "AL" LED (alarm) should be out.
The "NC" LED (Network Control) will be on if the modem is communicating
   properly to the NMS system at Motorola via the async PVC's.
The "DR" LED (Dial Restoral) should be out if the dial backup is not used.
The "CD" LED (Carrier Detect) and "RTS" LED (Request to Send) should be lit.
The "RD" LED (Receive Data) and "TD" LED (Transmit Data) will be lit if data
   is being passed.



               WHAT TO DO IF THE LINE DOES NOT COME UP
               =======================================

If there is a problem coming up on the leased line the two 3340 modems will
go to dial-backup automatically after about 1 1/2 minutes of trying on the
leased line.  While the modems are trying to sync up on the leased line you
can hear two tones coming from the far-end site (Motorola SMR Station) if you
monitor the Receive side of the line:  the pattern is 600 Hz for about 17
seconds, then 2100 Hz for about 3 seconds.  This pattern will keep repeating
until the modems finally go to dial backup.  If the 3340 at your site hears
these tones successfully (hopefully you have no wiring problem at your site)
your 3340 will transmit an 1800 Hz tone on RJ45 pins 1 & 2.  The far-end
modem should hear this 1800 Hz tone and sync up with your modem if everything
is O.K.   To monitor the RJ45 pins at the back of your modem there are
commercially available breakout devices (such as the HARRIS-DRACON 10230-000
sold by GRAYBAR).  Remember,  on the RJ45, pins 1 & 2 are XMT and pins 7 & 8
are RCV.

If you suspect a problem with the leased line it is best to use your TIMS
tester and loop the 829 Channel Interface at the far end and listen for your
1004 Hz tone coming back.  If you find a break in the leased line, report this
to Telco.


If you don't hear any tone coming in from the far-end site your 3340 modem will
not transmit any tone because it is optioned as "ORIGINATE".  The originate
modem will not transmit anything until it receives tone from the "ANSWER"
modem.



             H CABLE UP THE NETWORK MANAGEMENT PORTS
             ============================================

On the back of each 3340 Modem is a miniature 26 pin connector labelled "NC".
You will connect the Codex cable from this port to one of the ports (1-5) on
the Codex 2185 Digital Bridge.  The Bridge is used to multiplex the "NC" ports
so we use only one or two async pvc ports per Tymnet site.  At large we need
to "cascade" Bridges so that up to 16 modem "NC" ports are multiplexed into
one async PVC port.  We cannot multiplex more than 16  "NC" ports into one
async PVC port.

Here is how to cascade Bridges together:  "NC" ports from five 3340 modems are
cabled to ports one through five on the first Bridge.  Next, a standard
straight-through male/male cable is connected from port 0 (main channel) of
the Bridge to port 1 of the next Bridge.  Then four 3340 modem "NC" ports are
cabled to ports 2-5 of this next Bridge and a cable is connected from port 0
of this Bridge to port 1 of the third Bridge.  This process is repeated until
you have 16 3340 modems connected to cascaded Bridges.  Next, you connect a
standard straight-through male/female cable from port 0 of the last Bridge to
the I.D.S. Speed Converter port marked "TO DCE".  This Speed Converter changes
the 75 baud "NC" port speed to 300 baud going to the Consat PVC port.  The
Speed Converter should be installed in the same cabinet as the 3340 modem
racks.  Next, a long straight-through male/male cable is connected from the
"TO DTE" port of the Speed Converter to the Consat PVC port.  The PVC ports
feed back through the network to two Compact-XL's running tymcom slots that
connect to the Codex Network Management System at Motorola Headquarters in
Schaumburg, Illinois.


Strapping for the Codex 2185 Digital Bridge is as follows:

SW1-1 C       SW2-1 C    SW3-1 O
   -2 C          -2 C       -2 C
   -3 C          -3 C       -3 C
   -4 C          -4 O       -4 C
   -5 C          -5 C       -5 C
   -6 O          -6 C       -6 C
   -7 O          -7 C
   -8 O          -8 C


Strapping for the I.D.S. Model 6400 Speed Converter is:
   (Looking at the bottom of the unit)

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1     0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1    1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0


(NOTE:  Whenever the 3340 modem "NC" ports are connected to the async PVC
        port, the proper "NC" address must be set into the modem options and
        a call placed to the Motorola Network Control desk at Schaumburg so
        the operator can verify that the 9800 NMS system can communicate with
       that modem.

            TEST ROUTINES BUILT INTO THE 3340 MODEM
            =======================================


Even though the 3340 modem will be mostly under the control of the 9800
Network Management System, maintenance personnel can use the front panel of
the modem to select various test modes.  However, this can only be done if
the 3340 is not under the control of the NMS ("NC" light is OFF).  If the
"NC" light is ON you must go to the "CONFIG NETWORK" sub group and set "NC
Override" to ON.  This will allow operation of the modem test features from
the front panel while the NMS is trying to control it.

There are two categories of tests under the "TEST" main menu:  LOOP TESTS
and BER TESTS.
Press #1 to get to one of the five main menu groups.
Press #2 to get to the "*TEST" menu.
Press #1 until it reads "LOOP TESTS" or "BER TESTS".
Press #2 to get to the desired test under "LOOP" or "BER" then activate that
test.

To activate the "LOOP" tests you must choose the time duration for the test
(1 min, 5 min, 15 min, or continuous) and then activate the test by setting
it to "ON" or choosing a port number.
The LOOP TEST sub group gives you the following tests:
  Modem Check:  Same as a local analog loopback.
  Remote Digital Loopback:  Forces the remote modem into digital loopback so
  that whatever test pattern is sent into the local modem goes out over the
  line to the remote modem digital section and is then looped back around to
  the local modem.
  Local Digital Loopback:  Whatever test pattern is sent from the remote modem
  to the local modem is looped back around in the digital section of the local
  modem back toward the remote modem.
  Terminal Loopbac:  This is the local digital loopback.  Any test pattern
  sent into the local modem is looped back in the digital section of the local
  modem.
  Audio Loopback:  Takes incoming data from the remote modem and loops it
  back from the analog portion of the local modem to the remote modem.
  Test Tone:  Sends a 1004 Hz tone to the remote modem.

To activate the "BER" test you choose the BER address and channel and whether
it is an LBER (end-to-end over the line) or a DBER (tests the local modem with
an internal data test pattern.
When running the LBER you choose the channel and device address of the remote
modem.  Once the test is started you get a message showing the counting of the
test blocks sent.  If the test finishes correctly the front panel displays
"BER COMPLETE" and the test automatically shuts off.  If the test fails the
front panel displays "BER TEST FAILED".  After the "BER COMPLETE" message
press #2 to get the count of bit errors (in) and block errors (in).  Press #2
again to display (out) bit/block errors.
