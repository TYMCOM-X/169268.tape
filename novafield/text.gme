YOU HAVE COME UPON AN OLD TWO STORY BRICK BUILDING.THE BUILDING IS
NOT VERY OLD, BUT IT IS IN OBVIOUS POOR REPAIR.THE WINDOWS AND
SHUTTERS ARE DAMAGED AND THE BRICK HAS BEEN BASHED IN BY SOMETHING IN
A FEW PLACES.BEFORE YOU, RAGGED AND BLOODSTAINED, DOUBLE OAKEN DOORS
STAND OPEN.AS YOU CONSIDER THE ENTRANCE A FEELING OF DREAD AND EVIL
RISES INSIDE OF YOU.
2
AS YOU APPROACH THE OPEN DOOR OF THIS TWO STORY BUILDING, A SENSE OF
DREAD FILLS YOUR GUT.THE PLACE IS IN DISREPAIR AND HAS BEEN VANDALISED
BY SOME MAN OR BEAST.THE LIGHT GIVES A MEAGER VIEW OF WHAT'S INSIDE
AND SOMETHING INSIDE YOU TELLS YOU THAT IT'S NOT WORTH FINDING
OUT.
3
YOU ARE STANDING BEFORE THE MONASTERY.
4
THIS IS THE ENTRANCE HALL OF THIS HOLY BUILDING. IT CONTINUES TO
THE NORTH. AT THE END OF THE HALL YOU CAN MAKE OUT AN OPENING
TO A ROOM. THE SMELL OF DECAYING,ROTTEN FLESH PERMEATES THE BUILDING.
5
THIS IS THE ENTRANCE HALL OF THE BUILDING,IT RUNS NORTH AND SOUTH.
6
YOU ARE IN A HALLWAY THAT EXTENDS TO THE NORTH AND SOUTH. THERE
ARE DOORS ON EITHER SIDE OF YOU. THE ENTRANCE TO THE BUILDING LIES
SOUTHWARD.LANTERNS AND OTHER HALL DRESSING LIE
SMASHED AND SCATTERED ALONG THE HALLWAY.
7
YOU ARE IN A HALLWAY THAT LEADS NORTH AND SOUTH. THERE ARE DOORS
TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT.
8
ASHES AND BITS OF CHARRED PAPER AND WOOD INFORM YOU THAT THIS
WAS ONCE A BOOK ROOM OR LIBRARY.THE SHELVES AND OTHER FURNISHINGS
ARE BROKEN AND STICK UP OUT OF THE PAPER DESTRUCTION.
METAL DOORS LIE TO THE EAST AND TO THE NORTH.
9
YOU RUMMAGE ABOUT THE ASHES AND FIND ONE BOOK UNHARMED BY THE
UNEXPLAINED DESTRUCTION.IT IS BLACK, AND VERY OLD.
10 
THIS IS THE BOOK ROOM. METAL DOORS LIE EAST AND NORTH.
11
THIS IS AN ALMOST DIAGONAL SHAPED ROOM.IT IS RATHER SMALL WITH
A DOOR TO THE SOUTH AND ONE ALSO TO THE EAST. AN OPEN PASSAGE LEADS OFF
TO THE WEST. STEMMING UP FROM THE FLOOR A STAIRWAY LEADS UP OUT OF
SIGHT.
12
THIS IS A DIAGONAL ROOM WITH A STAIRWAY RISING UPWARDS. OTHER EXITS
LIE TO THE EAST,SOUTH, AND WEST.
13 
THIS APPEARS TO BE A COAT CLOSET. IT IS VERY SMALL AND HAS
A RACK RUNNING BETWEEN BOTHE SIDES. STRANGE HOWEVER, THERE ARE
NO COATS HERE AND NO SIGN OF ANY EVER BEING HERE.
14
YOU ARE IN A VERY SMALL COAT CLOSET.
15
YOU ARE STANDING BEFORE THE ENTRANCE TO WHAT APPEARS TO BE 
A DINING HALL.
16
YOU ARE IN A PASSAGE THAT LEADS FURTHER WEST, BUT IS
BLOCKED BY STONES AND OTHER DEBRIS.
17
YOU HAVE COME UPON A SORT OF PRIVATE TEMPLE OR MEDITATION ROOM.
THERE IS A PLATFORM UPON WHICH STANDS A STATUE OF SOME TORMENTED
GOD. THERE ARE VARIOUS RELIGOUS DECORATIONS, BUT THE MOST NOTABLE
OF THEM IS A LARGE,SHINY BRASS BELL HANGING FROM THE CIELING.
THERE IS A WOODEN TABLE UNDER THE BELL.
18
YOU ARE IN A HIDDEN MEDITATION ROOM.
19
SUNLIGHT FILTERS THROUGH BEUTIFUL STAIN GLASS WINDOWS ON
THE NORTH WALL, FILLING THE WHOLE DINING AREA WITH A RAINBOW OF
COLOURS. IT MAKES THE DISARRAYED FURNITURE AND BROKEN TABLES 
SOMEHOW PRETTY AMIDST THE DESOLATION.THERE ARE DOORS ON THE LEFT
AND RIGHT.THE FEELING OF EVIL AND DREAD IS TEMPORARILY RELEIVED AS
THE SUN CASCADES AROUND YOU.
20
THIS ONE-TIME DINING ROOM HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY RUINED. THE
FLOOR IS LITTERED WITH SHARDS OF BROKEN STAINED GLASS WINDOWS,
NOT TO MENTION THE SORRY STATE OF THE SURROUNDING TABLES,CHAIRS,
AND OTHER FURNISHINGS. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PICTURE THIS PLACE AS
A GREAT DINING HALL.THERE ARE DOORS ON THE EAST AND WEST WALLS.
21
THIS ROOM APPEARS TO BE LARGER THAN LIFE AT NIGHT. THE DINING
FURNISHINGS CAST SHADOWS IN THE STRANGEST FORMS WITH THE UNCERTAIN
LIGHT. REGARDLESS OF WHICH WAY YOU TURN,YOU CONSTANTLY GET THE
FEELING THAT YOU ARE WATCHED FROM BEHIND.
22
THIS IS THE DINING ROOM OF THE MONASTERY.
23
YOU HAVE ENTERED THE KITCHEN.LIKE THE DINING ROOM IT HAS
BEEN RANSACKED AND VANDALISED.
24
THIS IS A VERY SMALL,VERY BARE CLOSET.VERY NARROW STAIRS
LEAD UPWARDS.
25
YOU ARE IN THE MAIN HALL OF THE MONASTERY. IT LEADS BOTH NORTH AND
SOUTH. THERE IS A DOOR TO YOUR LEFT. A ROOM OPENS UP JUST NORTH OF
YOU. THE MAIN ENTRANCE IS SOUTH.
26
YOU ARE IN A HALLWAY WHICH LEADS NORTH AND SOUTH. THERE IS A
DOOR ON THE LEFT.
27 
YOU ARE IN A SIDE HALLWAY WHICH LEADS TO A DOOR TO THE EAST. 
THE DOOR LEADING TO THE MAIN HALLWAY IS TO THE WEST.
28
THIS ROOM IS CERTAINLY A LAVISH BEDROOM. MOST LIKELY IT WAS
A GUEST BEDROOM. THERE IS A BEUTIFUL BED AND OTHER
FURNISHINGS. THIS ROOM IS RELATIVELY GOOD ORDER, OBVIOUSLY IT HAS
NOT BEEN FOUND BY THE UNDEAD BEASTS THAT HAUNT THIS MONASTERY.
29
YOU ARE IN THE GUEST BEDROOM.
30
YOU ARE UNABLE TO TRAVEL IN THAT DIRECTION.
31
THERE IS A CLOSED DOOR BLOCKING YOUR PROGRESS IN THAT DIRECTION.
32 
THE STAIRS RISE UP INTO THE CENTER OF WHAT WAS A GREAT CATHEDRAL.
UP FRONT IS A LARGE PLATFORM,UPON WHICH STANDS A TALL STATUE OF
SOME GOD. BEFORE THE STATUE IS A BLOOD-STAINED SACRIFICIAL ALTAR.
THERE ARE MANY BENCHES HERE, ALL OF WHICH ARE NOCKED DOWN OR 
BROKEN. THE HEAD OF THE STATUE IS MISSING AND YOU CAN'T SEE IT
ANYWHERE IN THE ROOM. AT THE NORTH END OF THE ROOM IS A DOOR.
33
THIS IS THE CATHEDRAL OF THE MONASTERY. THERE IS A DOOR ON THE
NORTH WALL, LEADING DOWNWARDS IS A SET OF STAIRS.
34
YOU ARE STANDING IN A PASSAGE OUTSIDE OF THE CATHEDRAL TO YOUR SOUTH.
THE PASSAGE LEADS EAST AND WEST. THERE IS ANOTHER DOOR TO
YOUR NORTH.
35
YOUR ARE IN A PASSAGE OUTSIDE OF THE CATHEDRAL.
36
THE CORRIDOR ENDS HERE.THERE IS A SMALL DOOR TO THE SOUTH.
37
THE PASSAGE TURNS HERE GOING SOUTH AND ALSO EAST.THE PASSAGE
IS BARE AND UNINTERESTING.
38
THE PASSAGE DEAD ENDS HERE. THERE IS A LITTLE DOOR TO THE SOUTH.
39
THIS IS A SMALL CLOSET. IT IS BARE AND VERY DUST.
40
THIS ROOM IS VERY,VERY HOT. SO HOT THAT YOUR EYES BLUR SLIGHTLY.
DESPITE THAT THOUGH,YOU CAN SEE A WOODEN TABLE NEXT
TO A VERY NICE LOOKING KING SIZED BED.
41
LAYING ON THE BED YOU CAN SEE A BEUTIFUL WOMAN IN
A VERY REVEALING TUNIC.
42
THERE IS A FINE SUIT OF ELVEN CHAIN ARMOR HERE.
43
THERE IS A SHEATHED BRONZE LONG SWORD HERE.
44
THERE IS A SMALL LEATHER POUCH HERE.
45
THERE IS A LONG WOODEN STICK HERE.
46
THERE IS A VERY OLD BLACK BOOK HERE.
47
THERE IS A FINE SHINY BRASS LAMP HERE.
48
AN UGLY AND RATHER SHORT GHOUL STANDS HERE.
IT APPEARS TO BE UNFRIENDLY.
49
YOU RUMMAGE ABOUT IN THE ASHES AND BITS OF CHARRED PAPER TO
FIND NOTHING BUT YOUR HANDS DIRTY.
50
YOUR PHRASE IS MISSING OR HAS INCORRECT PREPOSTIONS.
51
YOU SEARCH ALONG THE WALL TO FIND.. A SECRET DOOR!
52
IT IS AS OBVIOUS AS THE NOSE ON YOUR FACE THAT A DOOR IS ON THAT WALL.
53 
YOU SEARCH ALONG THE WALL AND FIND NO TRACE OF A SECRET DOOR.
54
THERE ARE NO DOORS ON THAT WALL.
55
I DO NOT RECOGNIZE A NOUN IN THAT SENTENCE.
56
THIS WAS ONCE SOME SORT OF EXCERCISE OR TRAINING ROOM. THERE ARE
MANY MATS ON THE FLOOR AND TRAINING DUMMYS ARE TORN AND THE STUFFING
SCATTERED ALL ABOUT.
57
THERE IS A DECAYING DECREPID ZOMBIE HERE. ALTHOUGH IT APPEARS
TO BE MINDLESS, IT'S VIOLENT INTENTIONS ARE OBVIOUS.
58
YOU TRY TO MOVE THE STATUE,PUSHING AS HARD AS YOU CAN..BUT ALAS THE
JOB REQUIRES MORE STRENGTH THAN YOU HAVE.
59 
YOU STRAIN AND GRUNT AND TO YOUR SURPRISE THE STATUE SLIDES TO THE
LEFT AND EXPOSES AN OPENING. THE OPENING APPEARS TO GO IN AND THEN
DOWN TO WHAT COULD BE A ROOM.
60 
THE GREAT STATUE AT THE WEST END OF THE ROOM 
HAS BEEN SWUNG OPEN EXPOSING AN EXIT ON THAT WALL.
61
THERE IS A LITTLE STONE HERE. IT IS WHITE AND PERFECTLY ROUND.
62
THERE IS A LEATHER BACKPACK HERE.
63
THE ARMOR FITS SNUGLY AFTER YOU PUT ON AND FASTEN IT INTO PLACE.
64
THE SWORD IS NOW STRAPPED AROUND YOUR WAIST.
65
THE POUCH IS NOW TIED AROUND YOUR WAIST.
66 
THE BACKPACK IS NOW STRAPPED TO YOUR BACK AND HANGS
SQUARELY ON YOUR SHOULDERS.
67
IT IS IN THE BACKPACK WHICH IS ON YOUR BACK.
YOU MUST TAKE IT OFF FIRST.
68
THE STATUE SLOWLY, BUT SURELY MOVES BACK INTO PLACE.
69
THERE IS AN ELVEN MADE BACKPACK HERE.
70
STANDING HERE IS A COMPLACENT LOOKING LITTLE HOBBIT, WHO SEEMS
TO BE IGNORING YOU.
71
BEHIND THE STATUE YOU DISCOVER A SQUARE ROOM WITH WOODEN
WALLS AND A WOODEN FLOOR AND CIELING. THIS ROOM IS VERY
DUSTY AND IT APPEARS THAT NO ONE HAS BEEN HERE FOR A VERY LONG
TIME. ON ONE WALL (THE NORTH ONE) THE WORDS "SAIRE SUBDIR" 
WRITTEN IN SOME ODDLY COLOURED INK.
72
YOU ARE IN A SQUARE WOOD PLANK ROOM. THERE IS NOTHING UNUSUAL
HERE, EXCEPT FOR THE WORDS "SAIRE SUBDIR" ARE WRITTEN ON THE
NORTHERN WALL.
73
YOU ARE STANDING ON A LEDGE ON THE SECOND STORY OF THE MONASTERY.
74
YOU ARE STANDING ON A LEDGE OF THE SECOND STORY OF THIS MONASTERY.
STAIRS LEAD DOWN FROM HERE.
75
YOU ARE STANDING BEFORE A VERY SMALL BUILDING. THE DOORS
AND WINDOWS ARE ALL BOARDED UP AND NAILED DOWN. A LARGER
BUILDING IS NORTHWARDS, AGAINST THE
MOUNTAIN.
76
YOU ARE ON A LANDING DOCK MADE OF WOODEN PLANKS. THIS IS THE NORTH
SIDE OF THE RIVER WHICH ,BY THE WAY, DIVIDES THIS CRATER SHAPED
DEPRESSION. TO THE NORTH IS A LARGE MOUNTAIN RISING
UP AND OUT OF THE DEPRESSION.
77
YOU ARE ON THE WOODEN LANDING DOCK.
78
YOU ARE ON THE BEACH OF THE RIVER THAT FLOWS ALMOST SOUTHEAST TO
NORTHEAST. THE DOCK IS BEHIND YOU WHILE THE MOUNTAIN IS TO THE NORTH
OFF TO THE NORTHWEST IS A SMALL COPSE OF TREES.
79
YOU ARE ON THE BEACH, JUST NORTH OF THE DOCK.
80
AS YOU TRAVEL NORTH OF THE BEACH, THE SAND TURNS TO MOSTLY
FLATLANDS WITH SCATTERED BUSH AREAS. TO THE NORTH IS A SMALL 
COPSE OF TREES, FURTHER NORTH LIES A MOUNTAIN.
81
YOU ARE JUST NORTH OF THE RIVER.
82
THIS IS THE CENTER OF A SMALL GROVE OF PRETTY DOGWOOD
TREES. THE TREES LOOK AS THOUGH THEY WERE PLANTED HERE INTENTIONALLY
IN AN ALMOST CIRCULAR PATTERN. SMALLER TREES ARE NOW GROWING,HOWEVER,
THROWING OFF THE PATTERN THAT WAS SET BEFORE.
83
YOU ARE IN THE CENTER OF A SMALL COPSE OF DOGWOOD TREES.
84
THE STATUE IS NOW BACK IN IT'S ORIGINAL POSITION,
AGAIN HIDING THE EXIT BEHIND IT.
85
A LITTLE OLD DWARF STANDS HERE.
86
YOU ARE STANDING ON A HILL WHICH LEADS DOWN INTO A CIRCULAR
OR CRATER SHAPED DEPRESSION. FROM HERE YOU
CAN SEE THAT IT IS BASICLY FLAT WITH SCATTERED TREES. THE
RIVER CUTS OFF THE SOUTHERN THIRD FROM THE REST OF THE DEPRESSION,
FLOWING NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST. THE ENTIRE DEPRESSION IS SURROUNDED
BY CLIFF WALLS FORMED BY HIGHER GROUND.
87
YOU ARE ON THE HILL WHICH OPENS UP TO THE
CRATER-LIKE DEPRESSION.
88
HERE THE RIVER BEHIND YOU AND THE CLIFFS TO THE LEFT FORM
A CORNER PREVENTING PROGRESS FURTHER SOUTHWARD OR WESTWARD.
THE COPSE OF TREES LIES NE WHILE THE MOUNTAIN LIES NORTHWARDS
ALSO.
89
THIS IS FLAT GRASSY AREA NEAR THE TOP OF THE DEPRESSION.TO THE
EAST IS A MOUNTAIN WITH A BUILDING BUILT AGAINST IT.SOUTHWARD
THE RIVER RUSHES TO THE SOUTHEAST.
90
THIS IS THE GRASSY FLATS OF THE DEPRESSION.
91
HERE A CUL-DE-SAC IS FORMED BY THE MOUNTAIN TO YOUR RIGHT AND THE
CLIFFS TO THE LEFT AND THE NORTH. THE
GRASS HERE IS SCARCE OR YELLOW BECAUSE OF THE ROCKY
SOIL. A CAVE HERE SEEMS TO BURROW NORTHWARD INTO
THE ROCKY CLIFFS THAT RISE HIGH ABOVE THE GROUND.
92
THIS IS THE CUL-DE-SAC AT THE NORTHERN-MOST PART
OF THE DEPRESSION.
93
THIS IS MORE FLAT GRASSY AREA ON THE BOTTOM OF THE DEPRESSION.
JUST RIGHT ARE THE CLIFF WALLS THAT SURROUND THE DEPRESSION, TO
THE LEFT IS A GROVE OF TREES.
94
YOU ARE WALKING IN THE GRASS AREA BETWEEN THE MOUNTAIN JUST
NORTH OF YOU, AND THE COPSE OF TREES JUST TO THE SOUTH.
