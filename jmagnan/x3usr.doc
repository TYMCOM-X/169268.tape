Notes:
  1. The possible values of the escape from data transfer character as
specified by "n" are:
	0	- escape from data transfer impossible
	1	- 1/0(DLE) is the escape character
	2-31	- the ASCII character having this value is the escape
			character (but only when the interface is configured
			in the TYMNET Extended mode of operation)
	32-127	- the ASCII character having this value is the escape 
			character
Control-a and NUL can never be escape characters.


  2. The data forwarding characters corresponding to values of "n" are:
	0	- no data forwarding characters
	1	- alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9)
	2	- CR
	4	- ESC, BEL, ENQ, ACK
	8	- DEL, CAN, DC2
       16	- ETX, EOT
       32	- HT, LF, VT, FF
       64	- all other characters not in columns 0 and 1 not
			included in the above
      128	- all other characters not included in the above

	A combination of these values may be used in place of a single
value as shown in Table 1/X.3 (eg. 3 means all alphanumeric characters
and carriage return).

  3. Service signals are sent to the DTE based on the values:
	0 	- no service signals
	1	- service signals other than the prompt
	4	- prompt service signal

	A combination of these values may also be used.

  4. The result of a break character being received from the terminal
is determined by the following values of "n":
	0	- no action
	1	- send interrupt packet 
	2	- reset
	4	- send Indication of Break (X.29 or break message)
	8	- escape from data transfer state
       16	- discard output to the DTE

	A combination of these values may be used in place of a single
value as shown in Table 1/X.3.

  5. The terminal speed may be further divided into input and output
speeds using TYMNET National parameters 5 and 6.

  6. Valid terminal rates as specified by "n" are CCITT representations
of actual terminal speeds as listed below.

	Actual Speed		CCITT Representation
	110 bits/s			 0
	300 bits/s			 2
       1200 bits/s			 3
       2400 bits/s			12
       4800 bits/s			13
       9600 bits/s			14

  7. Multiple values are used to indicate in which direction(s) the linefeeds
are to be inserted (combinations of values may also be used).
	0 - no linefeed insertion
	1 - after each carriage return in the data stream to the DTE
	2 - after each carriage return in the data stream from the DTE
	4 - after each carriage return in the echo to the DTE

  8. Parity of the data (out)to the DTE may assume the values:
	0 - save original parity
	1 - mark parity
	2 - space parity
	3 - even parity
	4 - odd parity

  9. This parameter is incorporated into the set command for TYMNET
National terminal parameter 8 (carriage return delay).

			  Available Profiles
	
	The following profiles are currently supported by the TYMSAT.
A "T" in the value field means that the parameter value is determined by
the terminal identifier (TID) entered when contact with the TYMSAT is first
made (ie. by the service request signal). The TID may be the same as was
used for the unenhanced TYMSAT or may  be a carriage return (which always
causes command mode to be entered).

Notes:
	1. Currently, all supported TIDs turn off the (X-ON and X-OFF)
flow control of the DTE by the TYMSAT.
	2. Currently, all supported TIDs turn on linefeed insertion after
carriage return in the echo to the start-stop mode DTE.
	3. A TID of "d" at 110 bps turns on the echo ctl-h (tab) function.
All other TIDs turn the tab function off.
	4. Currently, all supported TIDs turn off the echo of a
ctl-h (backspace).
	5.  Currently, all supported TIDs turn on the echo of LF/CR/Rubout
for a linefeed.
	6. No parity modification of data to the DTE will occur unless the
TID is J(at 150 bps) or I or G(at 1200 to 9600 bps). These TIDs result
in even parity being set for data to the DTE.
	7. A TID of "g" turns off the carriage return delay switch. All
other TIDs turn this switch on. This switch determines the length and
position of the carriage return and linefeed delays.
