                                5 -  ISIS DDT Commands


             ISIS DDT is a subset of the KERNEL process on the ENGINE.  One may
        log into  ISIS on  any given ENGINE,  by directing  the log-in  to that
        machine's host 0.

             The  kernel  has a  good-guy  list, used  to  verify  the username
        logging in.  If the  user-name is valid, login may  proceed;  otherwise
        the  user  is  dropped.   If  valid,  the  list  is  checked  for  slot
        assignment.  If no slot is assigned to this user, the kernel asks for a
        slot number.  Once the slot has  a valid slot number, and if  that slot
        is available, the kernel will  connect the user to DDT.  The  user sees
        (USER TYPES, kernel types):

        USER:377;PASSWORD
        slot# :3                (only if no slot is pre-assigned)
        *

             When the "*"  prompt occurs, the user  is connected to  DDT.  Then
        the commands below can be used.

             Each user name in the good-guy list has certain licenses assigned.
        These licenses determine which  classes of slots that name  may access,
        and which set of operations is legal to that name.

             In particular,  certain of these  licences are  "access licenses",
        which permit  access to  certain special slots.   Every valid  user has
        ordinary access to  the normal "application"  slots (slot number  > 0).
        In addition, certain usages have special accesses defined:

           L.DISC  licence to format a disc;
           L.S0A   license to log into slot 0;
           L.SYA   license to log into slot 0FF (the ISIS system);
           L.SUA   license to log into slots associated with the supervisor.

             Having such license permits one to log into that slot, and perform
        certain commands.   Additional license is  required to  perform certain
        other commands, and these depend upon the access licenses:

           L.R     normal read access;
           L.L     normal load  access (permits the  loading and starting  of a
               dead slot);
           L.E     normal execution access (permits the starting and halting of
               a slot);
           L.H      normal halt  access  (permits halting  a slot  in  order to
               reload it);
           L.P     normal patch access (permits patching a running slot);
           L.S0R   slot 0 read access;

           L.S0P   slot 0 patch access;
           L.SYR   system read access;
           L.SYP   system patch access.

             In the  following command  description, each  will start  with the
        list of licenses required: "[L.X!L.Y]", where "!" is the logical ".OR."
        function,  and  special  slot requirements  are  assumed  from context;
        [L.R!L.S0R]  automatically  implies  normal (L.R)  and  slot  0 (L.S0R)
        respectively.

             Note that,  generally, if a  command requires Read  licence, Patch
        licence will also satisfy the requirement.

             Note, also, that certain commands require that the slot  be halted
        (disconnected from  the Dispatcher).  These  will be designated  by the
        requirement "L.HALT".






                          5.1  Initialize Address Space::  A


             [ L.HALT ! L.L ! L.H ! L.P ! L.S0P ].

             Set up address space for slot as one large MAC area.

             An  area larger  than  1 segment  is constructed  as  the required
        number of contiguous  segments (e.g., a slot  with 90-K will  result in
        segment  0  of 64-K  and  a segment  1  of 26-K).   No  protections are
        applied.






                           5.2  Set Breakpoint::  B ADDR NUM


             [ L.HALT ! L.L ! L.H ! L.P ! L.S0R ! L.S0P ].

             Set breakpoint NUM at ADDR.   B will undo any old  breakpoint NUM.
        If ADDR is zero B will undo the old breakpoint only.

                          5.3  Disable Watch-frog Timer::  D


             This  command causes  a slots'  watch-frog timer  to  be disabled.
        This enables a slot to be stopped for debugging purposes, and not crash
        because the watch-frog wasn't updated.






                                5.4  Execute Slot::  E


             [ L.HALT ! L.L ! L.E ! L.H ! L.P ! L.S0P ].

             E connects the  job associated with  a slot  and  starts execution
        independent of DDT.






                                   5.5  Fire-up::  F


             [ L.L ! L.H ! L.P ! L.S0P ! L.SYP ].

             F enables  the "KIO"  jobs associated with  a slot  for subsequent
        logon.






                                   5.6  Go:: G ADDR


             [ L.R ! L.L ! L.H ! L.P ! L.S0R ! L.S0P ! L.SYR ! L.SYP].

             G causes your program to start at ADDR.  It creates a PSW  using a
        half word  in the  user block.   The status  bits may  be changed  by a
        privileged user through the U command.

                                  5.7  Halt Slot::  H


             [ L.E ! L.H ! L.P ! L.S0P ! L.SYP].

             H halts  the job associated  with a slot;  if the slot  controls a
        "KIO" job, subsequent logons are disabled.






                                 5.8  Initialize::  I

             I should only be typed after a new load.






                                5.9  Suspend Slot::  J


             This command causes a slot to be suspended.

             Reads  NUMBER-OF-BLOCKS  (4  blocks/sector)  starting   at  user's
        virtual DISK-ADDR (16  bits, of which the  high 3 are the  area number;
        the rest  are beginning-block  number) storing  the result  starting at
        user's MEM-ADDR.

        additional digits  may be typed  indicating the cause  of the  last MAC
        interrupt.  (These are the 16 bits read from the MAC status register at
        the  time  of  the  interrupt.   See  the  TYMNET  ENGINE  document for
        elaborations.   These  latter digits  are  then cleared,  and  will not

                                  5.23  Spy::  V ADDR


             [ L.H ! L.P ! L.S0P ! L.SYP ].

             Spy expects that the user has previously issued  a "M CNT FAD LAD"
        command,  which has  specified number-of-bins  (CNT), spy-start-address
        (FAD), and spy-end-address (LAD).  When the "V ADDR" command is issued,
        ADDR specifies the start of  a table--in the user space--of  length CNT
        halfwords ("bins").  It is  assumed that the user has  initialized this
        array in  an appropriate fashion.   (ADDR = 0  causes Spy to  be turned
        off!)

             While spy is  active, interrupts will  exit to special  code which
        compares the address interrupted  from with the specified FAD  and LAD;
        if in range, the address is biased by -FAD, and the position within the
        range LAD-FAD is converted to  a corresponding bin number;  one  (1) is
        added to that bin.

             Spy is turned off on  command, OR if an overflow is  threatened in
        any bin [ 1+ (bin) = 0 (that bin has wrapped around, and counted  up to
        -1 already) ].

             Spy is intended as  a performance monitoring facility,  allowing a
        programmer to determine where  the code is most heavily  exercised.  It
        does have certain restrictions and penalties associated with it:  being
        driven by interrupts, it does impose a fairly heavy load on the system;
        also, the  implementation allows only  ONE slot's DDT  to use Spy  at a
        time.  Appropriate diagnostics  may be issued  for attempts to  use Spy
        incorrectly!

             See the M command for initialization command format.


           Example:

           M B,S,E     B = no. of Bins, S = Start Address, E = End Address.
           V BA        BA = Bin Address (start of Bins).

             [ L.R ! L.L ! L.H ! L.P ! L.S0R ! L.S0P ! L.SYR ! L.SYP].

             Search: 0  or 1 (match  or non-match), 1,2  or 4 (number  of bytes
        long).  VALUE is one word.  The search range set in M is used  with the
        mask set  in M.  The  mask is  applied only the  memory value,  not the
        search value.  In  a match search only  the addresses of  matched cells
        are printed, in non-match search  both address & value are  printed (on
        seperate lines).

             See the M command for initialization command format.


           Example:  Scan  without printing  (for example,  to look  for parity
               errors):

           M 0FF000,1000

             [ L.R ! L.L ! L.H ! L.P ! L.S0R ! L.S0P ! L.SYR ! L.SYP].

             Search: 1,2  or 3  (length of instruction  in half  words).  Enter
        search value in appropriate number of half words.  Search is match only
        and used search range set in M but not the mask.  Addresses  of matches
        are printed.

             If you have a Dispatcher-connected job, and it specifies a status-
        address,  control will  be transfered  to that  address, to  permit the
        execution of  code, at the  DDT level, which  will give  diagnostic and

        the terminal controlling the DDT slot.  This happens  AUTOMATICALLY for
        the  console TTY  connected to  DDT for  ANY slot.   Once flushed  to a

        oldest, are dumped to the terminal making the query.  This will include
        those which have already been  flushed, but does not of itself  cause a

        error log buffer.  An error  log table is output only if  memory errors
        were detected by the ECC circuitry on the semiconductor  memory boards.
        The table displays how long, in system time, since the  first occurance
        of  the error,  the address  of  the memory  board on  which  the error
        occurred, the number  of occurances of the  error, and the  chip number
        (for single bit errors) or the row number (for double bit errors) where
        the error  occurred on  the board.  Only  the location  of the  last 16
        different memory errors are maintained in the memory error log buffer.

                    5.31.28  ?CPU      --(query) CPU utilization

             A "snapshot" of the fast clock and the appropriate local clocks is
        performed, DDT dismisses for  approximately 1 second, and  now computes
        the  elapsed real  and slot  (virtual) time.   This is  converted  to a
        percentage,  and output.   Further, the  total "span"  used  (number of
        bytes processed, including padding and incorporating "folding")  of the
        Dispatcher  input  and  output  rings  is  output.   Users  with System
        licences will get a table for all slots; users with lesser licence will
        get the information for their slot only!

             This command MAY be  implemented on certain ISIS systems,  being a
        configuration-defined  parameter.  If  on, the  command  causes certain
        system parameters to  be monitored, and the  values to be  output, with
        titles; the  set of  parameters may vary  with time.   These parameters

             This  command transfers  a logical  unit (L.U.)  from one  slot to
        another.  This command requires SYS licence.

             To perform a transfer, one must connect to the slot that currently
        pocesses  the  L.U.  to be  transfered.   After  entering  the command,
        successive  prompts  requests  for  the  L.U.,  destination  slot,  and
        destination   L.U.  (all   responses   to  prompts   are   expected  in
        hexadecimal).  The source L.U. must not be null;  the  destination must
        be null.  The  source and destination slot  may be the same.   The slot
        originally in pocession  of the L.U. will  find that I/O is  halted and
        subsequent references to the L.U. (via SVC's) will fail (since it is an
        unasigned unit).

        system which  may be  enabled as following.   When assembling  the ISIS
        Kernel, a  disc unit  should be  allocated and  assigned to  the common
        logical unit for  all slots.  Set the  symbol FSYS equal to  the chosen
        logical unit number, (not the global unit number).  Thus  assembled the

        While a  file is  write opened,  any number  of DDT  W commands  may be
        issued.   An address  written  to in  a  previous W  command  cannot be

                    5.32.10  ?INIT

             Initialize disc unit, which erases all previous files.



             The initializing  of the  disc unit consists  of placing  all disc
        blocks in the FREE  file, which is a  file of unused disc  blocks.  Any
        command  which   requires  an  initialized   disc  (almost   all)  will
        automatically discover the initialization on the unit, or initialize it
        as in the ?INIT command.

             The file used in the system is a list of headers, with each header
        containing a  list of data  blocks.  The directory  is a linked  set of
        directory blocks.  Each directory block contains a word of link  to the
        next directory block, a word  of directory index which is 16  times the
        number of file entries listed in the block, and finally a list  of file
        entries.  A file entry is a four word record, the first word  being the
        first header block number for  the file, the second word the  number of
        blocks in the file, and finally two words of filename.  Each file has a
        file entry in a directory block, and there is no limit on the number of
        files.  The free  list file is a  special file which contains  lists of
        unused disc block numbers.  The  free list file remains 'open'  all the
        time.  A directory entry has a 8 byte name (unused bytes null), a block
        total field, and a first header number field.  A header contains a link
        to the next header  field, number of entries  field, and a set  of data
        block  list entries.   A  data block  list  entry has  a  user assigned
        address field, number bytes  field, and disc block number  field.  Some
        data blocks in a file will be compressed.  A data block list  entry for
        a compressed block, does not have a data block number field.  Rather it
        has a minus one in the left half of that field, and the compressed byte
        in the  right most byte  of that field.   Compression takes  place when
        writing to a file (?SAVE,  ?WRIT), and is used whenever a  character is
        repeated 0F (hex) times.






                                  5.33  C  don't use!


             "C":: [  ] the  C command is used  to switch  from ASCII  input to
        binary and back again.  It is used primarily by NAD, and use by logging
        in directly may cause strange operations.

                                    5.34  control-C


             A control-C  (03 or 83)  is used to  interrupt a user  program and
        return  control  to DDT.   It  also flushes  all  characters previously
        input.






                                    5.35  control-O


             A  control-O (0F  or 8F)  is used  to flush  the input  and output
        buffers.  This also terminates any output SVC in progress.
