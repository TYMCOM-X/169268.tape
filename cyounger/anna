              in behalf of Anna Laura Younger
              November 6, 1987


          To whom it may concern:

          In our declaration dated November 12, 1986, we stated
          our intentions to provide a home setting for Anna.

          I wish to add the following requirements, which should
          be considered in providing for Anna's future needs.

          1. Anna's 'home setting' shall include other 'family'
             members. At this point in her development it is a
             requirement that the 'family' include other children.
             This creates stimulating activities around her, and
             provides a surrounding in which she must learn to share
             with others and communicate her needs.

          2. The trust shall negotiate fair, reasonable, and
             renewable agreements with caretakers concerning
             Anna's care and maintenance of the property.

          3. It is not our intention that the caretaker or other
             children should pay any rents or share of the main-
             tenance cost of Anna's property.  Their presence is
             a requirement of the conditions of care and would have
             to be provided in any case. However, we expect
             that nominal charges might be made to compensate
             the trust for additional insurance and administrative
             costs due to this accomodation.
