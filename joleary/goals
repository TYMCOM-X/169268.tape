QUARTELY GOALS FOR KEN BIRSE.........4-1-89//////6-30-89



1. TO CONTINUE TO ORGANIZE MY CUSTOMER FOLDERS AND OBTAIN THE GRAPHICS CAPA-
BILITY ON MY PC TO BEGIN TO DRAW EACH CUSTOMER'S TOPOLOGY.

2. INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF DOCUMENTATION CONCERNING TYMNET PRODUCTS, NEW 
VERSIONS OF CODE, TECH TIPS, ETC.

3. I HAVE BECOME FAMILIAR WITH TYMNET'S VERSION OF X.25, ASYNC,ETC....BUT 
WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN SOME CLASSES ON 3270 PBH, SNA AND CMT. I FEEL THERE IS 
ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN MY KNOWLEGE OF THE 'IBM'-RELATED PRODUCT LINE. I FEEL
COMFORTABLE WITH THE WAY IBM (&CLONES) HANDLE SNA AND BSC...BUT NOT 100%
CONFIDENT WITH TYMNET'S VERSION OF THE PRODUCTS YET.

4. I HAVE MET WITH A FEW CUSTOMER'S SINCE LAST QUARTER, AND WOULD LIKE TO
MEET WITH A FEW MORE THIS QUARTER.

QUARTERLY OBJECTIVES FOR KEN BIRSE 

1. IN ORDER TO FURTHER ORGANIZE EACH CUSTOMERS PROFILE, I NEED TO CONSOLI-
DATE AND ORGANIZE WHATEVER INFO IS ON FILE AND TO HAVE A COPY OF EACH TYMFILE,
GEN, AND SPECIAL REQUESTS PERTAINING TO EACH CONNECTION.

2. CORRESPONDING TO GOAL 2 OF ABOVE, I BASICALLY NEED TO FIND TIME TO PRINT
OUT EACH DOCUMENT IN TECHREF PERTAINING TO WHATEVER SUBJECT I NEED.

3. I HAVE HAD 2 TTE CLASSES SINCE I HAVE COME HERE, ONE FOR TYMNET X25 AND 
THE OTHER WAS INTRO TO ISIS. A LOT CAN BE SAID FOR ON-THE-JOB-TRAINING AND
DOING THINGS BY POKING THROUGH DOCUMENTATION...BUT ATTENDANCE IN TTE CLASSES
IS IMPORTANT AS WELL. I WOULD LIKE TO GO TO A TYMNET 'SNA' COURSE THIS 
QUARTER AND MAYBE SNEAK A BISYNC AND CMT COURSE NEXT QUARTER AT THE MINIMUM. 
IT'S UP TO MANAGEMENT WHETHER I CAN HAVE THIS TIME OUT OF THE OFFICE AND 
AT TTE COURSES BECAUSE OF LOW STAFFING AT THIS TIME.

4. IN ORDER TO MEET WITH MORE CUSTOMERS THIS 1/4, I'D LIKE TO SUGGEST 
MAYBE A VISIT TO MAJOR CUSTOMERS EVERY 4-TH OR 5-TH WEEK ARRANGED IN 
CONJUNCTION WITH SALES, OF COURSE. THIS OBJECTIVE IS RELATED TO #4 IN
THAT BECAUSE OF A SKELETON CREW, IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE. BUT IF NOT ACC-
OMPLISHED WITH QUITE AS MUCH FREQUENCY, I'D LIKE TO SHOOT FOR A TRIP EVERY 2
MONTHS AT MINIMUM.
