		      TASK 1:  NODE RESOURCES DATA

  Please log into System 38 (under any username) for STEPs 1 to 3, and
  use the IBM PC for STEP 4.  Please contact Network Analysis for any
  questions.  Thanks!

  STEP 1:  Collect Probe (Supmap) data (do this at	FREQUENCY:  MONTHLY
	   the end of the month or the beginning of
	   the next month).
	
	A  Determine the sleeping Sup # from which Probe (Supmap) data
	   will be collected.

	   1  Find out the last sleeping Sup # (call NetCon).

	   2  Check that this sleeping Sup still contains data (in its
	      disk).  If LSTMIN reports zeros, then this Sup has its
	      disk data all cleared, and we need to go for another
	      sleeping Sup # (call NetCon and go through this step again).  
	      The Sup still contains data as shown here.

	C  Run the Pcom job (PERSTATS)SUPMAP.PCM.  This Pcom job takes
	   up to 8 or 9 hours to finish.  The file (PERSTATS)SUPMAP.LOG
	   records all the actions of this Pcom job.  When this Pcom job is
	   finished, System 38 will send MAIL to the username you logged into.

		-R PCOM;SUPMAP.PCM
	 	[PCOM in frame 53]


  STEP 2:  Make sure the input files (SUPMAP and	FREQUENCY:  MONTHLY
	   CKTS databases) are reliable to use.

	A  Check the databases (PERSTATS)SUPMAP.*.  The files
	   SUPMAP.NOD and SUPMAP.LIN should both be present, have
	   a creation date at the end of the month of interest or the
	   beginning of the next month, and should have a file size 
	   around that shown here.  

		-DIR (PERSTATS)SUPMAP.*

		,,,,,

	B  Check the database (NETSTAT)CKTS.DMS.  This file should
	   be present and the file size should be in the range shown
	   here.  

		-DIR (NETSTATS)CKTS.*

		CKTS    DME       2  26-MAY-87  302    ALL RD  NO  27-MAY-87(A)

		CKTS    DMD       2   6-FEB-87 1505    ALL RD  NO  27-MAY-87(A)


  STEP 3:  Collect the nodes data.			FREQUENCY:  MONTHLY

	A  Run the Pcom job (MSNTRACK)HWSW.PCM.  This Pcom should take
	   less than 2 hours to finish.  The file (MSTRACK)HWSW.LOG records
	   all the actions of this job.  When the Pcom job is finished,
	   System 38 will send MAIL to the username you logged into.

		-GFD MSNTRACK

		-R PCOM;HWSW.PCM
		[PCOM in frame 46]

	B  Type out and keep hardcopies of the output reports HWSW.RPT and
	   TYMNOD.RPT.  When it's production time for the Trend Analysis
	   Report, these output files will be respectively Tables 1.1
	   and 1.2.  These also contain the input data for the 
	   corresponding graphs (Figures 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3).

		-TYP HWSW.RPT
		,,,,,

		-TYP TYMNOD.RPT
		,,,,,


  STEP 4:  Produce the nodes graphs (Figures 1.1 to 1.3) FREQUENCY:  QUARTERLY
	
    NOTE:  The following steps require a basic understanding of Symphony
	   spreadsheet and graph functions (under the IBM PC).

	A  Update and save the spreadsheet (SYMPHONY/DATA)TRENDHWS.WRK
	   and its graphs.
	   	   
	   1  Turn on the PC and boot up Symphony.

	   2  Bring up the Symphony spreadsheet file TRENDHWS.WRK.

		SERVICES FILE RETRIEVE TRENDHWS.WRK <CR>
		
	   3  Update the spreadsheet.  No macros were written to automate
	      the updating of this simple spreadsheet.  Hence, the updating
	      is "freehand."  The following suggests the steps.  (Please see
	      Appendix IV for the structure of this simple, clearly
	      labelled spreadsheet.)

	      a Add the 3 new rows of cell entries, one per new month, using
	        the information on HWSW.RPT and TYMNOD.RPT of the last 3
	        months.

	      b Rearrange the labels (e.g. ALL, INTL,...) to the new 
	        bottom cell.  

	   4  Update one-by-one each of the 3 graphs (Figures 1.1 to 1.3).
	      Figures 1.1 to 1.3 used for last quarter's Trend Analysis
	      Report are stored and NAMED in the GRAPH mode of the
	      spreadsheet.  The following suggests the steps:

	      a Update the Ranges and Data-labels to include the new cell
	        entries, and realign the Data-labels (above, below, or right)
	        if needed.  Preview the figure before the updating, to get
	 	familiar with the Figure.
		
		MENU GRAPH 1ST-SETTING NAME USE FIGURE 1.1 <CR> QUIT
		PREVIEW <ESC> 1ST-SETTING
		RANGE X <DOWN> <DOWN> <DOWN> <CR>
		      A <DOWN> <DOWN> <DOWN> <CR>
		      ...
		      E <DOWN> <DOWN> <DOWN> <CR> QUIT
		DATA-LABELS
		      A <DOWN> <DOWN> <DOWN> <CR> <ABOVE>
		      ...
		      E <DOWN> <DOWN> <DOWN> <CR> <ABOVE> QUIT

	      b Preview the Figure, and make further adjustments (e.g.
	        Data-label realignment) if needed.  (Comparing this updated
		Figure with that of last quarter's would be helpful.)

		PREVIEW <ESC> 
		If the Figure does not look right, go back to 1ST-SETTING 
		(or 2ND-SETTING) and make any adjustments you think needed
		(e.g. realign a Data-label) if needed.

	      c	Do the above (a and b) for Figures 1.2 and 1.3.

	   5  Save the spreadsheet and each of the 3 Figures.

		SERVICES FILE SAVE TRENDHWS.WRK
		MENU GRAPH 
		1ST-SETTING NAME USE FIGURE 1.1 <CR> QUIT
	  	IMAGE-SAVE TREND11.PIC <CR> 
		1ST-SETTING NAME USE FIGURE 1.2 <CR> QUIT
		IMAGE-SAVE TREND12.PIC <CR>
		1ST-SETTING NAME USE FIGURE 1.3 <CR> QUIT
		IMAGE-SAVE TREND13.PIC <CR>

	B  Print the 3 graphs (Figures 1.1 to 1.3).

	   1  Exit Symphony and enter Printgraph
	
	   	SERVICES EXIT YES 

	   2  Use the appropriate directory (the one in which you saved
	      the graphs).  If you need to change it, go

		SETTINGS HARDWARE GRAPHS <directory name> QUIT QUIT

	   3  Select the graphs to be printed.  

		IMAGE-SELECT
		For each graph to print, move the cursor down to that
		graph's name and hit the space bar to mark it with a #.
		Preview the graph, if desired, with Alt-F8.  When done,
		hit the carriage return.  
	   
	   4  Print the graphs.  Check that the settings for Eject is Yes
	      and Pause is no.  If you need to change it, go

		SETTINGS ACTION EJECT YES QUIT QUIT or
		SETTINGS ACTION PAUSE NO QUIT QUIT

	      Check that the printer's density is where you want it.
	      Suggestion:  Use density 2 and Xerox the output to get a 
	      sharper image.  This is faster than using a higher
	      density.  If you need to change it, go

		SETTINGS HARDWARE PRINTER <move the cursor to density 4>
		<space bar> <CR> QUIT QUIT

	      When you're ready to print the graphs, use the command
	      GO.  The graphs will print one after another with an
	      automatic page feed so you can walk away and work on 
	      something else.

  STEP 3:  Produce the links graphs.  This step		FREQUENCY:  QUARTERLY
	   is similar to STEP 4 of TASK 1,
	   except that the spreadsheet to update and
	   save is (SYMPHONY/DATA)TRENDLNKWRK, 
	   and that the graphs are Figures 2.1 to 2.3.

			TASK 6:  DELAY/ALU DATA

  Please log into System 38 (under any username) for STEPs 1 to 2, and
  use the IBM PC for STEP 3.  Please contact Network Analysis for any
  questions.  Thanks!

  STEP 1:  Make sure the input files (SUPMAP, CKTS,	FREQUENCY:  MONTHLY
	   and OTIO databases) are reliable to use.

	A  Check the databases (PERSTATS)SUPMAP.*.  The files
	   SUPMAP.NOD and SUPMAP.LIN should both be present, have
	   a creation date at the end of the month of interest or the
	   beginning of the next month, and should have a file size 
	   around that shown here.  

		-DIR (PERSTATS)SUPMAP.*

	C  Check the database (NETSTAT)OTIO##.DMS (## is the month for
	   which the SUPMAP databases are created).  This file should be
	   present.  

		-DIR (NETSTAT)OTIO##.DMS

		OTIO05  DMS    1086  26-MAY-87 1421    ALL RD  NO  27-MAY-87(A)


  STEP 2:  Collect the delay/ALU data.			FREQUENCY:  MONTHLY

	A  Run the Pcom job (MSNTRACK)DLAY.PCM.  This Pcom job takes 2 to 4
	   hours to finish.  The file (MSNTRACK)DLAY.MAL records all the
	   actions of this Pcom job.  When this Pcom job is finished,
	   System 38 will send MAIL to the username you logged into.

		-GFD MSNTRACK

		-R PCOM;DLAY.PCM
		[PCOM in frame 17]

	B  Type out and keep a hardcopy of the output report DLSUM.RPT.
	   When it's production time for the Trend Analysis report, this
	   output file will be Table 6.1.  This also contains the input
	   data for the corresponding graph (Figure 6.1).

		-TYP DLSUM.RPT
