Note:  The above numbers reflect host-to-host traffic.  Host
information is obtained from the Ports Database, and traffic
information is subsequently obtained from the Daily Netstat
Database.  The host types are presumably determined by their
Node-Host Codes as follows:

     Host Type            Node-Host Codes
     ---------            ---------------
     Asynchronous         12, 14, 16, 20, 25, 30, & 32
