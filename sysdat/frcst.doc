NETWORK ENGINEERING MANAGER APPROVAL _________________ 


OBJECTIVE:

To produce a forecast for the average connect-hours per business day
in each one of our rotaries. The forecast method used is Exponential
Smoothing with trend algorithm. The forecast will be useful to engineer 
our rotaries properly for future growth, by making use of historical
traffic information.


KEY DEFINITIONS:

1. Exponential Smoothing = Forecasting method in which the most recent
                           data points are weighted heavier than
                           the older data points; each data point is
                           assigned a weight in an exponential manner.

2. Constant Growth = Forecasting method where the current traffic in a
                     rotary is grown by a chosen fixed percentage.

3. Linear Regression = Forecasting method in which all data points are
                       fitted into a straight line that minimizes the
                       squared error.

4. Slope = The angle of incline of a line between two points.
           It represents the average increase of connect-hours per month
           in a rotary.

5. `B' Intercept = The point where a line between two points
                   crosses on the Y-axis. It represents the starting
                   traffic level at the beginning of the rotary life.

6. Forecasting Horizon = the future period of time for which a 
                         connect-hours forecast is desired.

STATEMENT OF GUIDELINE:

To obtain an estimate of the number of connect-hours per business day in
a future month for each specific local access rotary in the network. 

ASSUMPTIONS USED:

1. Historical data points are reliable.

2. Average connect-hours per business day in each month
   represents accurately the activity of a rotary.

3. Exponential smoothing with trend algorithm is a statistically reliable
   forecasting method.

4. Short forecasting horizon (less than a year) yields accurate results.

5. Forecasts are done at both the city or rotary level.


PROCEDURE:
  

Follow the 5 steps described in this procedure. Please refer to the
EXAMPLE at the end of this procedure.


1) OBTAIN HISTORICAL DATA


   i.    Get into the PGRADE directory, system 28 and
         run MAGNUM ROTARY.PGRADE.

   ii.   At the prompt, type RUN CONNECT.HISTORY.REPORT.  This report
         will create historical data for a specified number of months.
         You will need to determine the starting and ending months for 
         the historical data desired. The earliest starting date for
         which data is available is March 1, 1983. The maximum number
         of months that you can specify is 36 months. For example, if
         you specify 3/01/83 as your starting date, the maximum ending
         date will be 2/28/86. Input notation is YYMMDD. When prompted,
         indicate that the report should be sorted by CITY. The HISTORY
         program takes about 25 minutes to run. The program FRCST.FTF
         uses this report as input.

    iii. At the prompt, type QUIT. The output file name will be
         HISTRY.CNT.  You will need to rename or copy HISTRY.CNT to the
         filename HISTRY.DMI.


2) CLEAN DATA


      i. The next step is to load the HISTRY.DMI into a X22 database.
         Run 1022 and at the asterisk type, LOAD HISTRY and then
         carriage return. At the next asterisk prompt type 
         USE (MSANAL)HISTRY.DMC and carriage return. The system
         will modify the HISTRY database, which takes about 15 minutes.

    ii. At the asterisk prompt, type QUIT. The output file name will be
        (PGRADE)HSTRY1.CNT.


3) OBTAIN FORECASTS USING THE FRCST.FTF PROGRAM


     i. Execute the program (PGRADE:28)FRCST.FTF. It will provide you 
        with a forecast of the average daily connect-hours per rotary,
        or per city. The connect-hours per city will incorporate both 
        the 1200 and 2400 baud rotaries' data into one rotary for that
        city. Connect-hours per rotary will keep the 1200 and 2400
        rotaries' data separated for that city. 

    ii. The FRCST.FTF program provides you with default parameters. It 
        will use these default parameters if you specify "N" for
        inputting your own parameters. If you want to specify your 
        own parameters, specify "Y" and the program will prompt you
        for each parameter input. After specifying the parameters desired,
        the program will run and finish without any more user input.
        The program takes a few minutes to run.


4) ANALYZE THE OUTPUT FILES FRCST.DAT AND (MSANAL)ANALYS.DAT
       
   A. EXPLANATION OF FRCST.DAT

     i. The FRCST.DAT output file will give an exponential smoothed value
        of the average connect-hours for each rotary or city in a future
        month. Use this value (last column) when running the PORTS program
        to determine the number of asynchronous dial-up ports in a rotary.
        (Do NOT use the DAILY.INF value). An asterisk by the rotary indicates
        that there are not enough data points for a reliable forecast.

         a) Explanation of Frcst.Dat columns

           1. Historic Data - last monthly value of connect-hours per
                              business day per rotary/city.
           2. Constant Growth - forecast in which historic data is grown
                                by a given percentage.   
           3. Exponential Smoothing - forecast using historic data points
                                      weighted in an exponential manner.
	
   B. EXPLANATION OF (MSANAL)ANALYS.DAT  [OPTIONAL]

     i. The second output file, (MSANAL)ANALYS.DAT, gives results on
        other forecasting methods used. Use this second output file
        only if you are interested in the following information:

          a) If you want to compare the forecast using Exponential Smoothing
             method against other forecasting methods, please
             look at the columns under the headings "ROTOR GROWTH" and
             "LINEAR REGRESSION".

          b) If you want to find out the average increase in daily connect-
             hours per rotary/city per month, look at the column
             under the heading "M=SLOPE".

          c) If you want to find out the average monthly percent growth in
             connect-hours per city/rotary, please look at the
             last column under the heading "AVERAGE GROWTH %".

      ii. The meaning of each column under this report is as follows:

           1. Historic Data - last monthly value of connect-hours per
                              business day per rotary/city.
           2. Rotary Growth - forecast using average monthly growth 
                              percentage for each rotary/city.
           3. Linear Regression - forecast in which data points are
                                  fitted into a straight line
           4. B=Intercept - point where a straight line crosses the Y-axis
           5. M=Slope - the angle of incline of a straight line
           6. Ave. Growth % - average monthly growth percentage value
                              for each rotary/city. This is the value
                              used for the Rotary Growth Forecasting.


    C. DISCREPANCIES IN THE OUTPUT FILES

        If you find discrepancies on the spelling of city names, please
        refer these city names to Edsel Garciamendez Budar. The
        discrepancies will be entered into an error file program.
        This program only assures that we gather connect-hours information
        for cities/rotaries regardless of the different pilot number and
        city name spellings throughout the existence of a local access
        city/rotary.



5) STOP.
