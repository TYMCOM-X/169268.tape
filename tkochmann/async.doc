1.0  INTRODUCTION 

The  purpose  of  this  document  is  to  assist  those concerned
personnel    whose    primary    responsibilities   include   the
installation  and  repair  of  ASYNCHRONOUS ROTORIES.  The person
using  this  document  should be already familiar with the basics
of  telephony  and data communications in general.  It is not the
author's  intention  to teach the novice.  Although this document
refers  to  the modems and ancillary equipment  currently used by
TYMNET,  the generic terms and techniques described herein can be
applied to any situation.  

It  is quite possible that the person referring to this document,
may  in  fact,  encounter  a situation where convention and logic
just  does  not apply, unfortunately that is sometimes the nature
of  the  beast.   If such is the case, do not hesitate to contact
me  at  (408)942-5088.   Any questions or comments should be sent
via ONTYME to QSATS.E/BLAIR.  

2.0  OVERVIEW 

Typically,  an  end  user  dials  the lead number of a rotory.  A
modem  not already in use answers the call.  The engine sends the
user  the  "please  log  in"  (PLI) in response to their terminal
identifier  (TID)  and the user logs into their host.  At the end
of  the  user's session the dial-up connection is terminated, and
the  answering  modem  becomes  available  for  the next incoming
call.  

A   second  method  currently  being  deployed  for  ASYNCHRONOUS
ROTORIES  is  the  IN/OUT  DIAL  SERVICE.  This is where the user
types  in  a host number during log-in, and the supervisor routes
them  to  the  applicable  host, who then dials the desired phone
number.   Beware  that when the user's session is terminated, the
modem  becomes  available  for EITHER another OUT dial call or IN
dial call.  

NOTE:  OUT DIAL ROTORY TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDELINES WILL BE COVERED
       IN A SEPERATE DOCUMENT.

Of  course,  the  above  scenarios  are  overly  simplified.  The
dynamics  of telephonic data communications can be mind boggling,
just  based  on  the  the sheer number of inter-acting equipments
involved.   That is why we will be concentrating on two (2) major
areas  in  this  document;  the originating end and the answering
end,  RELATIVE to the engine.  We will refer to telephone company
(TELCO)  methodolgy  because  it  is  inherent to  this document,
but, only  as a  means  to  obtain  the  solution  to the problem
scenario(s).   

3.0  MODEM TYPES 

In  order  to  give  this document a cohesive line of thought, we
will  cover  the modem types that are available and/or installed.
No  attempt  will  be  made  to  specifically cite vendor modems,
other  than  those  that  have  been  certified  for  use  on the
network.   The  Communication  Field  Bulletin (CFB) option under
(MENTRY:55)  details  those  modems  which  have  been tested and
optioned for the public network.   

3.1  USER MODEMS 

There  are numerous manufacturers of asynchronous modems.  As you
are  aware  of, the user will often buy the modem of their choice
to  run  on  the  network.  Because of the diverse nature of user
oriented  modems, it will be suffice to say that for the purposes
of  this  document,  that if the modem falls within the following
specifications, IT SHOULD be  compatible with our network: 

     1)  300, 1200 or 2400 BPS.  

     2)  FULL DUPLEX OPERATION 

     3)  RECEIVE SENSITIVITY UP TO -45 dBm 

     4)  TRANSMIT OUTPUT LEVEL DEPENDENT ON MODEM REGISTRATION 

     5)  CHARACTER LENGTH 10 BITS TOTAL 

     6)  SELECTABLE PARITY 

3.2  NETWORK MODEMS 

The  mainstay  of  the  public  network is the Racal Vadic VA3467
which  runs  at both 300 and 1200 BPS.  Also, the Concord 224 and
224AD  have  been  deployed,  and both of these modems operate at
1200 and 2400 BPS.  

The  Concord  Trispeed  and X.PC represent the next generation of
modems  that  are  being  used  on  the  network.   The  Trispeed
operates  at  300,  1200  and   2400  BPS,  and  serves  the dual
function  role  for  the  IN/OUT  DIAL  SERVICE.   The X.PC modem
provides  error  free transmission for the user at 1200 and  2400
BPS.  

3.3  SPECIAL NOTES 

TYMNET  has  in  the  past installed Ven-Tel modems on the public
network.   As  far as internal usage is concerned, Hayes, Penril,
Biz-Comp  etc.  proliferate  our offices.  Just keep in mind that
for  the  intents  of this document an asynchronous problem, is a
problem no matter whose label is on the modem.  

4.0  EQUIPMENT 

At  the  node's  location,  you will always find a combination of
the following: 

     1)  DATA TERMINAL EQUIPMENT (DTE) 

         This refers to the engine(s).  

     2)  DATA   CIRCUIT  EQUIPMENT  (DCE)  or  CUSTOMER  PROVIDED
         EQUIPMENT (CPE) 

         This will  be  the  modem(s)  or  data  set(s).  For the
         purposes of document, both terms are interchangeable.  

     3)  ANCILLARY EQUIPMENT 

         This consists  of  your  cabinets,  modem  racks,  power
         supplies and cabling.  

4.1  TELCO EQUIPMENT 

In  order to fully comprehend the troubleshooting portion of this
document,  I  will  discuss  with you the TELCO equipment and the
role  it  plays.  Typically, the serving central office (CO) will
bring  the  phone lines into your facility via cable pairs from a
point  called  the "wire center".  From the wire center the cable
pairs  are  run  into  the facility.  This central room is called
the  "underground".   From  the underground the lines are brought
into your equipment room.   

The  information concerning each individual line is recorded on a
circuit  lay   out  record  (CLR) card.  The CLR will include the
engineering  of  the  line,   cable  pair  assignments, equipment
type(s)  etc.   The phone lines are then  fanned and punched down
by  the  installer  as per the CLR.  The point at which the phone
company  responsibility  ends  and  the  customer  connects to is
called  the  "demarc".  In ALL cases, our rotories are terminated
on  data  jacks.  Our demarc is the point where we connect to the
data jack.  

The  three  (3)  types  of  registered  data jacks that have been
employed  at our  rotory locations are the RJ11C', the RJ41S' and
the  RJ45S'.    Synonymously  speaking,  for the purposes of this
document,  the  terms  97A  and  97B  blocks mean RJ41S and RJ45S
respectively,  though  in  the cases of the latter, RJ41 and RJ45
are terms used by TELCO to denote single line installs.  

NOTE:   ALL  ROTORIES  ARE ORDERED WITH 97A CONNECTING BLOCKS FOR
        OUR ROTORIES.  THE ONLY  EXCEPTION  TO THIS RULE HAS BEEN 
        WITH THE  CONCORD  224/224AD.   THESE MODEMS REQUIRED THE 
        RJ11C JACK.  

4.1.1  PROGRAMMED VS. FIXED LOSS LOOP (FLL) EQUIPMENT JACKS 

When  TELCO  installs the phone line, the order will specify what
modem  type will be used and the registration for it.  All of our
VA3467  and  Trispeed  rotories  are ordered for a 97A data jack,
set  to  the  "PROG" (programmable)  position.  The modems adjust
their output level in accordance with the programming resistor in 
the jack.   For  FLL  type  modems the  output level of the modem 
does not exceed -4 dBm. Telco installs the proper pad in the jack 
so that the total of the pad loss and loop loss will be between 8
and  9 dB.  This equates to a signal level of no greater than -12
dBm  reaching  the  serving  CO.  The 97A jack is also called the
"universal data jack".  

The  programmed  type  of  jack  (97B)  has  a resistor installed
within  it  after the loop loss for the line has been determined.
The  CPE  must  adjust  its   output  level  to  the  programming
resistor.  

The  method  by  which  the installer determines the value of the
pad/resistor  is  to  either  call  the CO milliwatt supply or to
call  the  testboard  at  the dial  tone office to send a 1004 Hz
tone  at  0  dBm.   So,  if the loop loss was 2.2 dB, a 97A3 jack
would  be  installed,  since loop loss is rounded to next highest
whole  number.  The 97A3 has a 6 dB pad/resistor value in it, and
mathematically follows:   

3 dB (loop loss) + 6 dB (pad/resistor value of 97A3) = 9 dB to CO

NOTE:   IF  THE  SWITCH  IS  SET  TO  FLL  ON  A  97A  JACK USING
        PROGRAMMABLE   MODEMS,  THEN  THE  SIGNAL  MAY   HAVE  AN 
        ADDITIONAL LOSS OF 3 dB DUE TO  THE BRIDGED  OPEN CIRCUIT  
        IMPEDANCE  OF THE PAD.  IF  THE  SWITCH ON THE 97A IS SET 
        TO  PROG USING  FIXED  LOSS  MODEMS, THEN THE DATA SIGNAL 
        WILL NOT REACH THE LINE.  THE  PRIOR  STATEMENT  IS  TRUE  
        IF  ATTEMPTING  TO CONNECT TO A 97B JACK USING FIXED LOSS 
        MODEMS.  

One   other   type   of  registered  CPE  exists.   This  is  the
"permissive"  type  of  modem  which  has a non-adjustable output
fixed  at -9 dBm, and it uses the  miniature voice jack.  Because
the  mean attenuation of business loops is 3 dB, the signal level
of no greater than -12 dBm reaching the CO is maintained.  

5.0  IN DIAL PROBLEM OVERVIEW 

Often  times  when  a problem is reported, the description varies
widely  from   the symptom which you will actually encounter once
you  begin  troubleshooting.  This is attributed to the user, who
is  not,  normally,  technically  inclined or it is blamed on the
person  who  took  the  trouble  report.  Accuracy in the initial
trouble  report  can  give  you a good idea of where to begin the
troubleshooting  process,  but  that  is  not  the  case  in  the
majority  of  trouble reports.  It has been an accepted fact that
each  person has their own method(s) of solving  problems.  It is
not  my  intention  to  change the way in which you troubleshoot,
but  rather, clarify the STEPS YOU SHOULD PERFORM in order to get
a satisfactory resolution to the problem.  

The majority of all ASYNC problem descriptions are a variation or
combination of the following: 

     1)  TONE NO RESPONSE (TNR) 

     2)  TONE ANSWER DROP 

     3)  RING NO ANSWER (RNA) 

     4)  BUSY SIGNALS 

     5)  GARBAGE 

Of  course,  the  different components which comprise the dial-up
connection   are   many,   and   it  is  the  intention  of  this
troubleshooting  document  to   cover  each  component,  so as to
logically  eliminate it as the cause of each of the above problem
descriptions.   

5.2  PRE-TEST CRITERIA 

Before  you  begin  troubleshooting any ASYNC problem, you should
always ask the following questions: 

     Q.  Does  the  user experience the same problem symptom each
         and every time they dial the lead number? 

     Q.  Does  the  user's  modem  pass  self test (if capable of
         doing so)? 

     Q.  Is  the  user's  modem  connected to the OEM recommended
         data jack? 

     Q.  Are other users experiencing the same problem? 

     Q.  Is the node/slot up in the network? 

     Q.  Can you duplicate the problem symptom? 

     Q.  Do the modems in the rotory pass self-test? 

If  you  can  answer  yes to these questions, then you definitely
have    a   problem.    Please   proceed   to   the   appropriate
troubleshooting  section  of  this  document  for your particular
problem symptom, after reading section 5.2.1.  

5.2.1  HYPOTHETICAL PROBLEM SCENARIO 

A  common  occurrence  in  the  "real world" that takes place, is
that  you  will  get  a trouble report on a rotory.  You dial the
lead  number  of  that  rotory  and  log  into the system with no
problem.   You  close  the  trouble report as "no trouble found".
Some  time  in  the near future, you receive another trouble call
on  the same rotory.  Once again, you dial the lead number of the
rotory  and  find  no  problem.   By  excercising a little common
sense,  it  should  become apparent that A PROBLEM DOES EXIST, IT
IS  JUST  THAT YOU HAVE NOT FOUND IT YET!  The following sections
explain why.  

5.2.1.1  ROTORIES 

In  our  hypothetical  problem  scenario,  the lead number of the
rotory  was  dialed.   There  are  two  (2)  types  of  rotories;
SEQUENTIAL  and  HUNT AND SEEK (or RANDOM).  These two (2) rotory
types  can  be  either  placed  for  local  usage  or  wide  area
telephone  service  (WATS).   The  telephone  numbers  associated
with  both  rotories  can  be  of  two  (2)  types.  You can have
individual  telephone  numbers  associated  with each line in the
rotory  or  you can have single call groups.  The latter is where
only  one  (1)  telephone  number is assigned to the whole rotory
group  and  a  suffix  is  attached  to each individual telephone
number after the lead number.  

The  SEQUENTIAL  rotory  works  in  a  pre-defined  fashion.   An
example  of  this  is   when  you  dial the lead number, the next
incoming  call  rings into the next line that is available in the
hunt group, and so on.   

The  HUNT AND SEEK rotory works in a random manner (i.e. there is
no  pre-defined  hunt  group sequence).  An example of this would
be  that  the CO's switching  equipment will connect the incoming
call  to  the first available line in the  rotory that it detects
in the "on-hook" condition.  

This  brings  us back to our hypothetical problem scenario.  When
testing  a rotory for a reported trouble, you ALWAYS HAVE TO TEST
THE  WHOLE  ROTORY!   This  can  be  a  tedious  and  repetitious
process,  but  one that has to be performed.  You will accomplish
two  (2)  things  by  testing the whole rotory.  First of all you
will  find  and  correct  the  trouble  reported.   Secondly, you
verify  the  operational readiness of the rotory (i.e. see if all
the lines are working properly).  

5.2.1.2  WIDE AREA TELEPHONE SERVICE (WATS) ROTORIES 

There  are  two (2) ways to test a WATS rotory.  The first method
involves  calling the "test number" (TN) provided by TELCO.  This
enables  you  to test the local loops for the rotory.  The second
method  involves  having  a  field engineer (FE) from the trouble
reporting  area  test  the rotory with you.  The latter method is
the  most desirable, since it enables you to test the trunk lines
between the  originating and answering ends.  

5.2.1.3  FOREIGN EXCHANGE (FX) ROTORIES

The FX rotory is usually installed so as to provide the user with
a connect cost savings.  By this we mean that the  user will dial
a local  exchange in their calling area, be routed through the CO
to the  local loop  dialed, which  is physically in another town.
There is only one (1) special note when testing  FX rotories, and
that is the FX line is normally designed to have a nominal 4.5 dB
loss to the dial tone office.

5.2.1.4  ROTORY RECAP

We  have  covered the basic fundamentals of rotory operations, so
as  to  give  you  a baseline for the subsequent sections of this
document pertaining to in dial rotory testing.   

NOTE:  THESE PROCEDURES ARE WRITTEN FOR ON-SITE TESTING! 

5.3  TONE NO RESPONSE 

The  TNR  is characterized by the user dialing the lead number of
the  rotory,  going  to  data on their modem and then not getting
any response to their TID.  

         NOTE:  SUBSTITUTE   MODULAR  CORD  FOR  9-PIN  CABLE  IF
                APPLICABLE.  

     1)  Select a line on the rotory that is not in use.  

     2)  Dial  the  number  and  verify  that  you can log into a
         system.  It is preferable that  this  number  be at  the  
         end  of  the rotory.  This  will  become  your  baseline 
         testing number.  

     3)  Log  off  your  test  number  and  reserve  the modem by
         busying it out.  

     4)  Dial  the  lead  number  of  the rotory and log into any
         system.  

     5)  Log off the port and busy out the modem.  

     6)  Repeat steps 4 and 5 until you land on the TNR.  

         NOTE:  REMEMBER  TO  TEST  THE  WHOLE ROTORY, SINCE MORE
                THAN ONE (1) TNR CAN BE ON THE ROTORY! 

     7)  Unbusy all the modems.  

     8)  Roll  the 9-pin cables  between  the  TNR  modem and the
         test modem.  

     9)  Dial  the  TNR  phone  number.   If  you  can log into a
         system, then this  means  that  the TELCO line and 9-pin 
         cable are okay.  If you can not log into  a system, then 
         either the TELCO line is bad or the 9-pin cable is  bad.   
         Replace  the  9-pin cable with a known good one.  If the 
         TNR  still exists, then you have a bad line, so turn the
         number  into  TELCO.      If   the   TNR   number  works  
         with  the  replacement  cable, then you have  fixed  the  
         problem.   Tag  the  bad cable and  order a  replacement 
         for it.  

    10)  Dial  the  test  number.   If you can log into a system,
         then the modem, engine cable  and  engine port are okay.  
         If you can not log in, then proceed to step 11.  

    11)  Normal  the  9-pin  cables  and  roll  the 25-pin cables
         between the TNR modem and the test modem.  

    12)  Dial  the  TNR  number.   You  are now testing the TNR's
         modem.  If you  can log  into  a system, then you have a 
         bad engine port or cable.  If you  can  not log  into  a  
         system, then the modem is bad.  Replace the modem.  

    13)  Dial  the  test  number.   You are now testing the TNR's
         engine port and cable.  If  you can  log  into a system, 
         then the TNR's engine port and cable  are  okay  and you 
         have a bad modem.  Replace the modem.  

    14)  If  in  step 13 you can not log into a system, then this
         means  that  the engine  port  or  25-pin  cable is bad.  
         Replace  the 25-pin  cable with a  known  good  one.  If 
         the TNR still exists, then you have a  bad  engine port.   
         Run  diagnostics  on  the async card.  If  the TNR works  
         with the  replacement  cable,  then  you  have fixed the
         problem.  Tag the  bad cable and order a replacement for 
         it.  

         NOTE:  NORMAL  UP  THE  25-PIN CABLES BEFORNING THE
                DIAGNOSTICS.  

    15)  Repeat  steps  8 through 14 for any other TNR's found on
         the rotory.  

    16)  Call HTS if you have any questions.  

5.4  TONE ANSWER DROP 

The  tone  answer  drop  is characterized by the user getting the
answer  tone from our modem, but when they go to data the dial up
connection  drops.   The  steps  to  troubleshoot the tone answer
drop  are  the  same  as for the TNR.  If you have any questions,
call HTS.   

5.5  RING NO ANSWER (RNA) 

The  RNA  is characterized by the user dialing the lead number of
the  rotory  and  instead  of getting answer back tone, they keep
hearing the 20 Hz ringing tone.  

         NOTE:  SUBSTITUTE  MODULAR   CORD  FOR  9-PIN  CABLE  IF
                APPLICABLE.  

     1)  Select a line on the rotory that is not in use.  

     2)  Dial  the  number  and  verify  that  you can log into a
         system.  It is preferable that this  number  be  at  the  
         end  of  the rotory.  This  will  become  your  baseline 
         testing number.  

     3)  Log  off  your  test  number  and  reserve  the modem by
         busying it out.  

     4)  Dial  into  the  lead  number of the rotory and log into
         any system.  

     5)  Log off the port and busy out the modem.  

     6)  Repeat steps 4 and 5 until you land on the RNA.  

         NOTE:  REMEMBER  TO  TEST  THE  WHOLE ROTORY, SINCE MORE
                THAN ONE (1) RNA CAN BE ON THE ROTORY.  

     7)  Unbusy all the modems.  

     8)  Determine  whether  or  not DTR is being supplied by the
         engine port.  Look at  the  connector panel, PSM control 
         card or use a blue/red box.  

     9)  If  DTR  is  present and you still get the RNA, with the
         RNA ringing,  redial  the  lead  number  and  see if you 
         land on the RNA number.  This  is  called checking for a 
         "break" in the rotory.  

         NOTE:  STEP  9  REQUIRES A MULTI-LINE TELEPHONE SET.  IF
                ONE IS NOT AVAILABLE, HAVE   SOMEONE   ELSE  DIAL  
                THE  LEAD NUMBER.  

    10)  If  you  land  on  the RNA, then you have a break in the
         rotory and you will have to turn the  number into TELCO.  
         Report the problem  as a  break in  the  rotory and tell 
         TELCO between which lines it is.  

    11)  If  you  do  not land on the RNA, but ring into the next
         line in the  rotory, then  you  have  a problem with the 
         engine port, engine cable,  modem,  modem cable or TELCO 
         line.  

    12)  Roll  the 9-pin cables  between  the  RNA  modem and the
         test modem.  

    13)  Dial  the  RNA  phone  number.   If  you  can log into a
         system, then  this  means that  the TELCO line and 9-pin 
         cable are okay.  If you can not log into  a system, then 
         either the TELCO line is bad or the 9-pin cable is  bad.   
         Replace  the  9-pin cable with a known good one.  If the 
         RNA   still  exists,  then  you have a bad line, so turn
         the number into TELCO.    If   the   RNA   number  works  
         with  the replacement cable, then  you  have  fixed  the  
         problem.   Tag  the  bad cable and  order  a replacement 
         for it.  

    14)  Dial  the  test  number.   If you can log into a system,
         then the modem, engine cable  and  engine port are okay.  
         If you can not log in, then proceed to step 15.  

    15)  Normal  the  9-pin  cables  and  roll  the 25-pin cables
         between the RNA modem and the test modem.  

    16)  Dial  the  RNA  number.   You  are now testing the RNA's
         modem.  If  you can log  into  a system, then you have a 
         bad engine port or cable.  If you  can  not log  into  a 
         system, then the modem is bad.  Replace  the modem.  

    17)  Dial  the  test  number.   You are now testing the RNA's
         engine port and cable.  If  you  can log  into a system, 
         then the RNA's engine port and cable are  okay  and  you 
         have a bad modem.  Replace the modem.  

    18)  If  in  step 17 you can not log into a system, then this
         means that engine port  or 25-pin cable is bad.  Replace 
         the 25-pin cable with a known  good  one.   If  the  RNA 
         still exists, then you have  a  bad  engine  port.   Run  
         diagnostics  on  the async card.  If the RNA works  with 
         the   replacement   cable,  then  you  have  fixed   the
         problem.  Tag  the bad cable and order a replacement for 
         it.  

         NOTE:  NORMAL  UP  THE  25-PIN CABLES BEFORE RUNNING THE
                DIAGNOSTICS.  

    19)  Repeat  steps  8 through 18 for any other RNA's found on
         the rotory.  

    20)  Call HTS if you have any questions.  

5.6  BUSY SIGNALS 

There  are two (2) types of busy signals.  The first type of busy
signal  is  the  one  that  the caller gets when the actual phone
line  is  in  an  "off-hook"  state.  The serving CO detects this
condition  and  will  send  to  the caller a 60 IPM (impulses per
minute)  signal.   The  second  type  of  busy  signal, sometimes
called  the  "fast  busy",  indicates  a  trunkside problem (i.e.
trunk  group  overflow,  all  trunks busy, internal busy etc.) at
one  of  the  CO's  in  the  call path.  This  busy signal can be
distinguished by a 120 IPM signal.  

5.6.1  120 IPM BUSY 

The  only recourse a caller can take when they encounter the fast
busy  is  to dial the operator, and ask the operator to place the
call  for  them.   If you still get the 120 IPM signal, then this
indicates  that  the  serving  CO  for the phone number dialed is
experiencing  the  trunkside  problem.   You will have to ask the
user to try placing their call at a later time.  

5.6.2  60 IPM BUSY 

     1)  Depending on the node's TYMFILE do the following: 

         SOLO CONSAT 

         a.  Log into Xray.  

         b.  Issue  the  "AS  U"  command  to see which lines are
             active.  

         c.  Issue  the  "BP"  command  to  see  which  lines are
             busied out.  

         d.  Proceed to step 2.  

         ISIS CONSTAT 

         a.  Log into extended DDT.  

         b.  Issue  the  "PORT"  command  to  see which lines are
             active.  

         c.  Issue  the  "QBUSY"  command  to see which lines are
             busied out.  

         d.  Proceed to step 2.  

     2)  Physically   verify   that   the   lines  shown  in  the
         applicable step 2,  are  accountable  with  those modems 
         actually in use.  

     3)  Dial  the  lead  number,  busying  out  each unused line
         until you get to busy.  

         NOTE:  REMEMBER  TO  TEST  THE  WHOLE ROTORY, SINCE MORE
                THAN ONE (1) BUSY CAN BE ON THE ROTORY. 

This  is  where  it  can  get tricky.  If you can dial the number
directly  and  get on it, then this means that TELCO has the make
busy  in  the wrong place.  If you can not get on the number, but
get  the  busy,  this  means  TELCO  has  a  "busy  out"  problem
somewhere  with  their  equipment or our equipment is busying out
the line.  

     4)  Disconnect the 9-pin cable from the modem.  

     5)  Redial  the number.  If you get the busy, then TELCO has
         the line busied  out.  This  can  be  caused by numerous 
         problems, but it is suffice to  say  that it  is a TELCO 
         problem, and you will have to report it to them.  If you 
         get  a  RNA,  then  this  means  that  our  equipment is
         busying out the line.  

     6)  Reconnect the 9-pin cable.  

     7)  Select a line on the rotory that is not in use.  

     8)  Dial  the  number  and  verify  that  you can log into a
         system.  It is preferable that  this number  be  at  the  
         end  of  the rotory.  This  will  become  your  baseline 
         testing number.  

     9)  Roll  the  25-pin cables between busy modem and the test
         modem.  

    10)  Dial  the  busy  number.  You are now testing the busy's
         modem.  If  you can log  into  a system, then you have a 
         bad engine port or cable.  If you  can  not  log  into a 
         system, then the modem is bad. Replace the modem.  

    11)  Dial  the  test  number.  You are now testing the busy's
         engine  port  and  cable.  If you  can  not  log  into a
         system, then the busy's engine port and cable  are  okay
         and you have a bad modme.  Replace the modem.

    12)  If  in  step 11 you can not log into a system, then this
         means  that  the  engine  port  or 25-pin  cable is bad.
         Place a blue/red box on the engine cable  and  check pin
         25.  If pin 25 is high, and the port was not busied  out
         as  per  step  1, then  you have a bad engine port.  Run  
         diagnostics on  the  async card.  If pin 25 is not high,
         and you still get the  busy,  then  the  engine cable is 
         cable  is  bad.  If the busy works with the  replacement  
         cable,  then  you  have fixed the problem.  Tag the  bad 
         cable and order a replacement for it.  

         NOTE:  NORMAL  UP  THE  25-PIN CABLES BEFORE RUNNING THE
                DIAGNOSTICS.  

    13)  Repeat  steps 1 through 12 for any other busies found on
         the rotory.  

    14)  Call HTS if you have any questions.  

5.7  GARBAGE 

Garbage  can  be  best  described  as  "digitized  trash" that is
modulated/demodulated  through the telephone network and shows up
as  unwanted  gobbledegook on the user's terminal.  The causes of
garbage  are  many,  but  as  is the case with the  previous test
sections,  we  will  limit our procedures to isolating and fixing
the problem(s) at the rotory end.  

5.7.1  MILLIWATT READINGS 

The  milliwatt  reading  is used to determine the loop loss for a
line.   Insufficient  gain/loss  is  a  contributing  factor  for
garbage  on  a  loop.  We will be referring to taking a milliwatt
reading  in  this  test  section.  In order to perform this test,
do the following: 

     1)  Set up your  transmission  test set (either the Ameritec 
         or  HP4935A)  to  600  ohm  termination.   Connect  your  
         transmission test set across tip and  ring of  the loop.  

         NOTE:  DO NOT TAKE THE READING  WITH THE TEST SET JACKED 
                INTO THE  MODULAR  JACK!   THIS  INVALIDATES  THE
                TEST READING.  

     2)  Dial the  CO  milliwatt supply or request the testboard, 
         at the dial tone office, to send a 1004 Hz tone at 0 dBm 
         on the loop.  

     3)  The  numerical  reading is equal to your loop loss.  So, 
         -5 dBm = 5 dB loop loss.  

     4)  If the reading  is  fractional,  then  round  it  to the  
         next highest whole number.  

     5)  Verify that the pad/resistor value is the proper one for 
         the loop.  

5.7.2   

         NOTE:  SUBSTITUTE  MODULAR  CORD  FOR   9-PIN  CABLE  IF 
                APPLICABLE.  

     1)  Select a line on the rotory that is not in use.  

     2)  Dial  the  number  and  verify  that you can log into  a 
         system.  It is preferable that this number be at the end 
         of the rotory.  This will become your  baseline  testing
         number.  

     3)  Log  off  your  test  number  and  reserve  the modem by 
         busying it out.  

     4)  Dial  the  lead  number  of  the rotory and log into any  
         system.  

     5)  Log off the port and busy out the modem.  

     6)  Repeat steps 4 and 5 until you land on the garbage line. 

         NOTE:  REMEMBER  TO  TEST  THE  WHOLE ROTORY, SINCE MORE 
                THAN ONE (1)  GARBAGE  LINE CAN BE ON THE ROTORY.  

     7)  Unbusy all the modems.  

     8)  Roll  the  9-pin  cables  between  the garbage modem and
         the test modem.  

     9)  Dial   the  garbage phone number.  If you can log into a  
         system, then   this  means that the TELCO line and 9-pin 
         cable are okay.  If you  can not log into a system, then 
         either the  TELCO  line  is  bad  or  the 9-pin cable is
         bad.   Replace  the  9- pin cable with a known good one.  
         If the garbage still exists, then you have a bad line.  

    10)  Take  a  milliwatt  reading of the loop.  If the reading
         is  different  from the jack installed, then report this 
         as  the problem  to  TELCO.   If  the  reading  is okay, 
         then there  is a  problem  from  the  CO  to  the  jack.
         In either case, you  will  have to report the phone line 
         into TELCO.  

    11)  If  in  step 9,  replacing the cable cleared the garbage  
         problem, then you have fixed  the  problem.  Tag the bad 
         cable and order a replacement for it.  

    12)  Dial  the  test  number.   If you can log into a system,
         then the modem,  engine  cable and engine port are okay.  
         If you can not log in, then proceed to step 13.  

    13)  Normal  the  9- pin  cables  and  roll the 25-pin cables 
         between the garbage modem and the test modem.  

    14)  Dial  the  garbage  number.   You  are  now  testing the
         garbage line's modem. If you can log into a system, then 
         you have a  bad  engine  port  or cable.  If you can not 
         log into  a  system, then the modem is bad.  Replace the 
         modem.  

         NOTE:  UNBUSY THE TEST MODEM.  

    15)  Dial  the test  number.  You are now testing the garbage 
         line's engine port  and  cable.   If  you can log into a  
         system, then  the  garbage  line's engine port and cable
         are  okay  and you have a bad modem.  Replace the modem.  

    16)  If in step  15  you can not log into a system, then this 
         means that  the  engine  port  or  25-pin  cable is bad.   
         Replace the  25-pin  cable  with  a  known good one.  If
         the  garbage  still   exists, then you have a bad engine 
         port. Run diagnostics on the async card.  If the garbage 
         line  works with  the  replacement  cable, then you have 
         fixed the problem.   Tag  the  bad  cable  and  order  a
         replacement for it.   

         NOTE:  NORMAL  UP  THE  25-PIN CABLES BEFORE RUNNING THE  
                DIAGNOSTICS.  

    17)  Repeat   steps  8  through  16  for  any  other  garbage
         problems found on the rotory.  

    18)  Call HTS if you have any questions.  

5.8  SPECIAL NOTE

All of the above troubleshooting procedures were written with the
assumption that the problems would  follow any of  the rolls.  It 
has been the case, that sometimes the chassis or chassis position
may go bad.  In the event that this may occur, normal logic would
dictate replacement of chassis.  Do not hesitate to do so.
