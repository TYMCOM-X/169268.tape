PROJECT: Support VA-IDCU Proposal preparation.

   OBJECTIVE: To provide all technical data necessary to complete 
              Appendix B of the VA-IDCU proposal.  The type and format of the 
              data is specified by Steve Poppe. 
 
   NOTES:
          The data for Appendix B is provided in four reports.

        . VA FACILITY UTILIZATION (1) - This report is provided only for year 
          8 and describes the available resources in each NIF and how they 
          will be used by the equipment to be installed at that NIF.

        . VA SITE LOCATION CONFIGURATION (3) - This report is provided for 
          years 3, 6 and 8.  It describes the hardware configuration for each 
          NIF.

        . A report listing the bandwidth requirements for each NIF was 
          provided to Steve so that he could obtain pricing estimates from 
          MCI.

   TIME SPENT ON PROJECT:  Approximately 2 1/2 weeks since last review.

   DUE DATES:

        Revisions are being made to this appendix continuously. One Due Date 
        was met on Jan. 30th and one on Feb. 10th.  The next Due Date is 
        currently set for Feb. 24th.
        

PROJECT: Support VADATS Network analysis.

   OBJECTIVE: To collect data and generate reports which will provide 
        information to aid in the analysis of the VA private network.

   NOTES: 
        . XRAY NS, ND and KS statistics have been collected for 379 nodes and
          534 links in the VA network.

        . Round trip delay and circuit path statistics were collected for the 
          "Worst 20" Nodes (by session) in the network.

        . Resource information was collected from PROBE via SUPMAP and from 
          SITE and HOST data bases provided by Mike Marburger.

   TIME SPENT ON PROJECT:  Approximately 1 1/2 weeks since last review.

   DUE DATES:
        Data was collected by Feb. 8th
        Reports should be finished by Feb. 17th
        Analysis and any changes/new reports to be completed by Feb. 24th



PROJECT: PC-DELAY

   OBJECTIVE: To provide a PC based tool to help monitor network delay and 
        session reliability (as estimated by the circuit hop length).

   NOTES:    PC-DELAY is designed -

        . For use by Network Analysts
        . To collect circuit trace data through PROBE
        . To collect round trip delay data through XRAY
        . To have the same general design as PC-NTRACK, with windowing, pop-up 
          menus, user defined collection dates and times, and reports 
          generated from an internal data base system.

   TIME SPENT ON PROJECT:  Approximately 1 week since last review

   DUE DATES:
        Assuming that IDCU and VADATS are finished as scheduled -
        Collection Module completed by March 3rd
        Processing Module completed by March 10th
        Report Generation Module completed by March 17th
