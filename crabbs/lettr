I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR A GREAT TEAM EFFORT AND YOUR
INDIVIDUAL SUPPORT.  WE ACHIEVED OUR GOAL WITHIN THE COM-
MITTED TIME-FRAME AND OUR NEW PROCESSES/RECOMMENDATIONS
CONTINUE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

ALL OF YOU WILL BE RECEIVING A CERTIFICATE OF APPRECIATION
FOR YOUR STERLING EFFORTS/CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE TQM PROJECT
"INSTALLATION PROCESS".  UNFORTUNATELY, THERE WAS A
MIX-UP AS TO WHOM THE MEMBERS REALLY WERE, THEREFORE,
SOME OF YOU WILL BE RECEIVING YOUR CERTIFICATES EARLIER
THAN OTHERS (PLEASE BE PATIENT).

REGARDS,
W.C.
