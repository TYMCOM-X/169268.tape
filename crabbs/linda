RE: REVISION TO OVERTIME PAY

************************************************************************
BASED UPON THE SPECIAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS NOW ON-GOING, SEVERAL
OF MY EMPLOYEES WILL FROM TIME TO TIME, EXCEED THE TYPICAL NUMBER OF
WEEKLY HOURS ON THE PAGER.

FOR THIS REASON, WE HAVE TWO(2) INCIDENTS OF NEGELECTING TO REPORT
ACCURATELY THE HOURS VS TYPE OF OVERTIME (DOUBLE OR ONE AND ONE-HALF
PAY).  I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO RESOLVE THESE TWO INCIDENTS BY USING THE
ATTACHED WORKSHEETS (FOR YOUR PERUSAL). IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, PLEASE
CALL ME FOR AN EXPLANATION.
