SUBJ:  NOVA "INFRASTRUCTURE" PROJECT SCHEDULES


*************************************************************************

AS A RESULT OF OUR PAINFUL EXPERIENCES WITH MAJOR "NOVA" WEEKEND
PROJECTS, WE ARE STRONGLY RECOMMENDING THAT OUR TIME SCHEDULE BE
REVISED TO LEAST IMPACT OUR CUSTOMER BASE.  THIS PAST WEEKEND,
THE BOSTON NODE SITE WAS SEVERLY IMPACTED WITH PROLONGED DOWN-TIME.
THIS SITE IS ONLY HALF-WAY COMPLETED, WITH ADDITIONAL PROJECTS YET
TO GO.     PLEASE REVIEW THE ATTACHED SCHEDULES:


      A.  THE SCHEDULE TO ACHIEVE A JULY 31ST COMPLETION.
          ATTEMPTING TO COMPLETE ALL OF THESE PROJECTS
          IN ONE WEEKEND COULD BE CATASTROPHIC FOR OUR 
          CUSTOMERS.  11 NODE SITES
                     139 NODES TO BE INSTALLED
                     143 "OLD" NODES TO BE DE-INSTALLED
                     150 CUSTOMER HOST MOVES

      B.  A MORE REALISTIC SCHEDULE WITH THE CUSTOMER IN MIND
          AS WELL AS OUR SUPPORT PERSONNEL.  THIS SCHEDULE
          WILL EXTEND THE COMPLETION EFFORT TO 8/22.
          THIS 3-WEEK EXTENSION WOULD ALLEVIATE MOST OF THE
          PROBLEMS WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED THUS FAR:

             
          1. MANAGING MULTIPLE, LARGE PROJECTS AT THE SAME SITE.
          2. POTENTIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON MAJOR NODE SITES.
          3. PROLONGED OUTAGES AFFECTING OUR CUSTOMERS
             (DUE TO LACK OF EXPERTISE AND HIGH VOLUME).
          4. THE BURN-OUT OF FIELD ENGINEERS AND SUPPORT PERSONNEL.
          5. HADWARE ISSUES CONTINUALLY ARISE, REQUIRING RE-WORK.
          6. COMPONENT AVAILABILITY ISSUES
